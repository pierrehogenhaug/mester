**EU MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Senior Secured Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Senior Secured Notes
is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, “EU
**MiFID II”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Senior Secured Notes to eligible counterparties and**
professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Senior Secured
Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however, a
distributor subject to EU MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining
appropriate distribution channels.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process, the target market assessment in
respect of the Senior Secured Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Senior Secured Notes
is only eligible counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook (“COBS”), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the


-----

EUWA (“UK MiFIR”); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Senior Secured Notes to eligible counterparties
and professional clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance
Sourcebook (the “UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules”) is responsible for undertaking its own target market
assessment in respect of the Senior Secured Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market
assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**EU PRIIPs Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Investors**

The Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor
means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II; or
(ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (as amended, the “Insurance Distribution Directive”),
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID
II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the “EU
**PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to retail**
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Senior Secured Notes in any
Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended, the
“EU Prospectus Regulation”) for the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of notes. The Offering
Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purposes of the EU Prospectus Regulation.

**UK PRIIPs Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors**

The Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not
be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation
(EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of
the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance
Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of
Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently,
no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA (as amended, the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and, therefore, offering
or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Senior Secured Notes in the
United Kingdom will be made pursuant to an exemption under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic
law by virtue of EUWA (as amended, the “UK Prospectus Regulation”) from a requirement to publish a prospectus
for offers of notes. This Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for the purpose of the UK Prospectus Regulation.

commencing on    , 2024, provided that the final interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes will be on    , 2030. Prior to   , 2026, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a “make-whole” premium. Prior to    ,
2026, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may also redeem, during each 12-month period commencing with the Issue Date (as defined below), up to 10% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes, if any) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof. In addition, prior to    , 2026, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer may redeem at its option up to 40% of the Senior Secured Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings. At any time on or after    , 2026, the Senior

Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may be required to make an offer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes at a purchase
price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Senior
Secured Notes. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” for further information.

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes
will be guaranteed (the “Notes Guarantees”) on a senior basis by Asda Group Limited, Asda Stores Limited, McLagan Investments Limited, The Burwood House Group Limited and Euro Garages
Limited (the “Guarantors”). On the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by first-priority security interests over (a) the issued share
capital of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the “Issuer Share Collateral”), (b) any material intercompany receivables owing to the Senior Notes Issuer (as defined herein) by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, (c) the material intra-group receivables owing to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by other member of the Group, (d) the material bank accounts located in England and Wales of the

by first-priority interests over the Material Real Property (the “Post-Closing Real Estate Collateral,” and together with the Post-Closing Non-Real Estate Collateral, the “Post-Closing Collateral,”
and together with the Initial Collateral, the “Collateral”). The Issuer Share Collateral and any other material intra-group receivables owing to the Senior Notes Issuer by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer (collectively, the “Shared Security”) also secures the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Senior Notes (as defined herein) on a second-priority basis.

The Guarantors also guarantee the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement (including the New Revolving Facility) on a pari passu and equal and ratable basis with the
Senior Secured Notes (and on a senior basis to the Existing Senior Notes). Additionally, the Collateral (including the Shared Security) secures the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement
on an equal and ratable basis with the Senior Secured Notes (and, with respect to the Shared Security, on a senior basis to the Existing Senior Notes). The Collateral (including the Shared Security)
may also secure certain hedging obligations and (in the event that the Term Loan Facilities (as defined herein) are repaid in full) certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted
to be incurred and secured on the Collateral on a super senior basis in the future. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

There is currently no public market for the Senior Secured Notes. Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited (the “Authority”) to list the
Senior Secured Notes on the Official List (the “Official List”) of The International Stock Exchange (the “Exchange”) and to admit the Senior Secured Notes for trading on the Exchange. The
Exchange is not a regulated market pursuant to the provisions of Directive 2004/39/EC on markets in financial instruments, as amended. There can be no assurance that any such listing will be
granted or maintained and settlement of the Senior Secured Notes is not conditioned upon obtaining this listing or permission.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made
available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available the Senior Secured Notes to any retail investor in the

qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No

domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes
or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering

or filed with the _Autorité des marchés financiers_ (the French financial markets authority (“AMF”)) and does not
require a prospectus to be submitted for approval to the AMF.

Consequently, the Senior Secured Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold to the public in
France (offre au public de titres financiers) (other than to qualified investors and/or a restricted circle of investors
acting for their own account), and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any offering or marketing materials relating
to the Senior Secured Notes may be made available or distributed in any way that would constitute, directly or
indirectly, an offer to the public in France (other than to qualified investors and/or a restricted circle of investors acting
for their own account).

The Senior Secured Notes may only be offered or sold in France to: (i) a restricted circle of investors acting
for their own account (cercle restreint d’investisseurs agissant pour compte propre) in accordance with Articles L.
411-2 and D. 411-4 of the French Code monétaire et financier and/or to qualified investors (investisseurs qualifiés)
as defined by Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation. Prospective investors are informed that: (i) this Offering
Memorandum or any other materials relating to this Offering Memorandum have not been and will not be submitted
for clearance to the AMF; (ii) in compliance with Article L.411-2 of the French Code monétaire et financier, the
restricted circle of investors subscribing for the Senior Secured Notes should be acting for its own account and (iii)
the direct and indirect distribution or sale to the public of the Senior Secured Notes acquired by them and the qualified

This Offering Memorandum has not been and will not be approved and/or published pursuant to the Austrian
Capital Markets Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz), as amended, and has not been passported into Austria pursuant to the EU
Prospectus Regulation. Neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other document connected therewith constitutes
a prospectus according to the EU Prospectus Regulation and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other

purposes of this provision, the expression a “public offering of Notes” means any communication (whether originating
from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a financial intermediary) to the public in any form and by any means,

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**General**

**_Presentation of Financial Information_**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain financial information for the Senior Notes Issuer and its
subsidiaries, including historical information for the Group, which consists of the Senior Notes Issuer and its
subsidiaries. The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum includes certain audited and unaudited
financial statements, non-IFRS financial information, operating segment information and other information, each as
set forth below. For an overview of the entities in the Group, see “Summary—Summary Corporate and Financing
_Structure.”_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer with no revenue-generating
activities of its own or material business operations, and its primary assets relate to its shares in Acquisition 2 and its
primary liabilities relate to inter-group balances with the Senior Notes Issuer, commitments under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the issuance of the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the guarantees of the Existing Senior Notes and the
Transactions. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England
and Wales as a private limited company on September 3, 2020 and re-registered as a public limited company on
December 18, 2020, for the purpose of consummating the LBO Acquisition (as defined herein).

**_Historical Financial Information_**

All historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Senior Notes Issuer.
Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to “Asda,” “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company” or the “Group” in
respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to the Senior Notes Issuer and its
subsidiaries, collectively. The Senior Notes Issuer is a public limited incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales on September 3, 2020 to act as an intermediate holding company for Asda and the immediate holding company
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. It is a holding company with no revenue-generating activities of its own, and no
business operations, and its primary assets and liabilities, respectively, relate to an intercompany receivable of £1,683
million, its shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the issuance of the Senior Notes. Consequently, no separate
historical consolidated financial information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has been included in this Offering
Memorandum.

The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum includes:

    - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2021 prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards in
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act of 2006 (the “2021 Financial Statements”);

    - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2022 prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards in
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act of 2006 (the “2022 Financial Statements”);
and

    - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2023 prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards in
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act of 2006 (the “2023 Financial Statements,” and
together with the 2021 Financial Statements and the 2022 Financial Statements, the “Financial
**Statements”).**

The 2021 Financial Statements and the 2022 Financial Statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP,
as set forth in their audit reports included elsewhere herein. The 2023 Financial Statements have been audited by
KPMG LLP, as set forth in their audit reports included elsewhere herein. Unless otherwise stated, no other financial
information presented in this Offering Memorandum has been audited.

xii


-----

In this Offering Memorandum we present certain financial information related to periods prior to 2021. Prior
to 2021, we presented the financial information of Asda Group Limited and its subsidiaries. The financial information
for periods prior to 2021 has been presented herein for illustrative purposes only and investors should place no reliance
on such information. This Offering Memorandum does not include the audited financial statements for any period
prior to 2021. There can be no assurance that, had such information been audited or reviewed, there would not have
been any discrepancies (including material) compared to the financial information presented herein.

In addition, all historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Senior
Notes Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, the financial results of the Senior Notes Issuer do not include
a full year of trading in the year ended December 31, 2021, as it acquired the trading group Asda Group Limited part
way through the year on February 16, 2021. As a result, results for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the Senior
Notes Issuer consolidated group do not constitute a full comparative period. In certain instances, to provide a more
meaningful comparison, the results for the year ended December 31, 2021 down to the level of operating profit are
presented on an annualised basis as if Asda Group Limited had been acquired by the Senior Notes Issuer on January
1, 2021. Such annualised results are derived from the financial statements of Bellis Finco plc for the period ended
December 31, 2021 and the actual results of Asda Group Limited from January 1, 2021 to the date of acquisition of
Asda Group by Bellis Finco plc on February, 14 2021.

Following the closing date of the EG UK Acquisition on October 31, 2023, the results of EG UK were
consolidated into our results. Following the closing of the Arthur Acquisition in October 2022, the CMA implemented
an initial enforcement order (the “IEO”) and consequently, management concluded that the restrictions imposed by
the IEO meant that the Group did not obtain control of the Arthur Business at such closing date. On May 30, 2023,
after accepting our proposed remedies of disposing of 13 of the acquired sites, the CMA lifted the IEO and the results
of the Arthur Business were consolidated into our results from that date. Our results in 2023 have been impacted by
the revenues and expenses of the acquired business starting from the relevant date when we started consolidated the
results of the applicable acquired business.

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards,
as adopted by the United Kingdom, and in conformity of the requirements of the UK Companies Act (“UK **IFRS”)**
requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the
process of applying our accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas
where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in the Financial Statements.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting
_Policies and Estimates.”_

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this Offering
and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Prospective investors should consult their
professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences between UK IFRS, the International Financial
Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (“EU IFRS”) generally accepted accounting principles in the
United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), UK GAAP and other systems of generally accepted accounting principles
and how these differences might affect the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum, and (ii) the
impact that future additions to, or amendments of UK IFRS principles may have on our results of operations and/or
financial condition, as well as on the comparability of the prior periods.

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the
applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, which would
apply if the Senior Secured Notes were being registered with the SEC. There could be significant differences between
UK IFRS and U.S. GAAP, as applied to the Senior Notes Issuer. We neither describe the differences between UK
IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile the Senior Notes Issuer’s UK IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP.
Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and investors should consider this in making their
investment decision. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will impose no obligation on us to reconcile the Senior
Notes Issuer’s future financial statements prepared under UK IFRS to U.S. GAAP.

See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports of Ernst & Young LLP and
KPMG LLP.

xiii


-----

In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the
independent auditors’ reports from (1) KPMG LLP for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and (2) Ernst &
Young LLP for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, state that neither KPMG LLP nor
Ernst & Young LLP, as applicable, assumes responsibility to anyone (including holders of the Senior Secured Notes)
other than the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer’s members, as a body, for its audit work or the audit
reports or opinions it has formed. Each of KPMG LLP and Ernst & Young LLP has undertaken its audit work, in
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, to state to the Senior Notes Issuer’s members those
matters that it is required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.

Investors in the Senior Secured Notes should understand that in making these statements, the independent
auditors have confirmed that they do not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as the purchasers of the Senior
Secured Notes) other than to the Senior Notes Issuer and its members, as a body, with respect to the report and to the
independent auditors’ audit work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a
registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities
Act or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to such
limiting language, the recourse that investors in the Senior Secured Notes may have against the independent auditor
based on its report or the consolidated financial statements to which it relates could be limited. See “Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Financial, Reporting and Other Matters—The audit reports of Ernst & Young LLP and KPMG LLP_
_included in this Offering Memorandum include statements purporting to limit the persons that may rely on such reports_
_and the opinions contained therein.”_

**Certain Restatements and Reclassifications**

The Group has undertaken a detailed review of its application of IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets in relation
to testing for impairment of non-current assets. In particular, the Group has reassessed the application of the IAS 36
with respect to the following stages of the impairment review:

    - Identifying Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”) which exhibit impairment triggers;

    - Calculating the carrying value of CGUs which are tested for impairment; and

    - Calculating value-in-use (“VIU”) as part of determining the recoverable amount of CGUs.

As the reassessment of the Group’s application of IAS 36 has been applied in order to provide more reliable
information about the carrying value of the Group’s non-current assets at the balance sheet date, the Group has applied
judgement to conclude that the effect of the revised allocation of central costs to both the assessment of impairment
triggers and the forecast cashflows used in the value-in-use calculations and the allocation of central assets to CGUs
should be applied to the impairment review conducted at December 31, 2022.

This results in a pre-tax impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2022 of £377.4 million (posttax £312.2 million) of which £357.5 million (pre-tax) was not previously recorded in the 2022 Financial Statements.
As this amount results from a change in application of the requirements of IAS 36, the Group has recorded a prior
year adjustment as per the requirements of IAS 8. The Group has also carried out the same impairment review at
December 31, 2021 and concluded that no changes in presentation are required as there were no significant changes
in the property values in the period since the LBO Acquisition in February 2021 to the end of 2021.

The net recoverable amount of the CGUs which was subject to impairment in the year ended December 31,
2022 increased in the year ended December 31, 2023 leading to a partial reversal of the impairment recorded in the
year ended December 31, 2022. This resulted in a net pre-tax impairment reversal of £225.7 million (post-tax £183.4
million) being recorded in the income statement in the 2023 Financial Statements.

The opening deferred tax liability includes the restatement for impairments, resulting in a reduction in the
opening deferred tax liability of £65.2 million.

In 2023 the Group identified that hardware assets with a net book value of £39.2 million were originally
classified as intangible assets. These have been reclassified to plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings during the year
ended December 31, 2023.

xiv


-----

During the year ended December 31, 2023, a non-operating distribution property with a carrying value of
£20.5 million was reclassified as held for sale within current assets. It was determined that this asset met the criteria
for being classed as held for sale.

In addition, the Group’s presentation of the year ended December 31, 2022 has been restated in the 2023
Financial Statements to separately show amounts classified as other income and to present an updated impairment
value Other income comprises concession and commission income and rental income. Rental income relates to income
earned by the Group as a lessor from sites located in the proximity of certain stores. In the year ended December 31,
2022 and in the 2022 Financial Statements, rental income was netted against operating costs. However, in the 2023
Financial Statements, rental income has been included in other income. Other income as disclosed in note 4 of the
2022 Financial Statements was £42.5 million. Following a detailed review, amounts totalling £15.0 million of
concession and commission income, which were netted against operating costs in the 2022 Financial Statements, have
been reclassified in the 2023 Financial Statements and included as £57.5 million in concession and commission
income, to better reflect their nature.

For more information related to any restatements or reclassifications see the notes to the 2023 Financial
Statements included elsewhere herein.

**Unaudited Pro forma Adjusted Financial Information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited financial information adjusted to give pro forma
effect to the Transactions (“As Adjusted Financial Information”). See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial
_Information and Other Financial Data—Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators” and “Capitalisation.”_

The As Adjusted Financial Information included in this Offering Memorandum has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act or any generally accepted accounting
standards. The assumptions underlying the As Adjusted Financial Information have not been audited or reviewed in
accordance with any generally accepted accounting standards. Any reliance you place on this information should fully
take this into consideration.

The As Adjusted Financial Information has been provided for informational purposes only. Results indicated
by certain of these measures may not be realised, and funds depicted by certain of these measures may not be available
for management’s discretionary use if such results are not realised. Further, the As Adjusted Financial Information
does not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of operations or our cash position or financial position as
at any future date. The actual results may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial
information for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the As
Adjusted Financial Information.

The As Adjusted Financial Information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in
“Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial Data,” “Selected Consolidated
_Financial Information,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”_
and “Risk Factors” and the financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

In this Offering Memorandum the Group presents certain financial measures that are not required by or
presented in accordance with UK IFRS (the “Non-IFRS Measures”). The Non-IFRS Measures included in this
Offering Memorandum do not alone provide a sufficient basis to compare the Group’s performance with that of other
companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an equivalent IFRS measure (if applicable)
or any other generally accepted measure as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. Such non-IFRS financial
information has not been audited or reviewed by either KPMG LLP or Ernst & Young LLP.

We believe that the presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures provides investors with additional useful
information to understand our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that
EBITDA is a measure commonly used by investors. The Group’s Non-IFRS Measures may not be directly comparable
with similarly titled measures used by other companies. The EBITDA Measures (as defined below) and related
leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of financial performance under UK IFRS and should not be

xv


-----

considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of
performance derived in accordance with UK IFRS. You are encouraged to evaluate each of the adjustments reflected
in the Group’s presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures and whether you consider each to be appropriate. In addition,
each of the Non-IFRS Measures may be defined differently from the definitions of corresponding or similar terms
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Group’s Non-IFRS Measures have important limitations as analytical
tools. Some limitations of the Non-IFRS Measures include:

    - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal
payments on the Group’s debt;

    - they do not reflect any cash income and certain other taxes that the Group may be required to pay;

    - they are not adjusted for all cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Group’s statements of
cash flows;

    - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters the Group considers
not to be indicative of its ongoing operations; and

    - in respect of Adjusted EBITDA, Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA and the other Non-IFRS Measures that
reflect such measures, they reflect certain adjustments for anticipated cost savings, synergies and other
estimates that may not be realised, whether in part or at all.

Furthermore, you should carefully consider the risks and limitations of the Non-IFRS Measures, as they are
based in part on assumptions made by the Group’s management regarding the future impact of actions that have not
yet been, and which may not in fact be, implemented. For example, there is a risk that the synergies we seek to achieve
may not be realised in the anticipated time frame or at all and that the magnitude of cost savings may be significantly
less than expected.

Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary
cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet
our obligations, including in relation to the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby. You should compensate for these
limitations by relying primarily on the Group’s UK IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Measures only in a
supplemental manner to evaluate the Group’s performance.

Our primary Non-IFRS Measures are defined as follows:

**_EBITDA_**

EBITDA, when used in this Offering Memorandum, is calculated by adding back to the Group’s profit for
the period income tax (credit)/expense, interest, amortisation and depreciation. See “Summary Historical Consolidated
_Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_

**_EBITDA Margin_**

EBITDA Margin means the Group’s EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue (including fuel) for the
relevant period.

**_Adjusted EBITDA_**

Adjusted EBITDA, when used in this Offering Memorandum, means the Group’s EBITDA for a particular
period as adjusted for other income (such as (gain)/loss on disposal and gain/loss on sale and leaseback), certain
historical income and costs certain impairment charges, actual EBITDA attributable to Arthur Foodstores Limited
from closing of the transaction on October 30, 2022 through the CMA lifting the IEO on May 30, 2023 (as relevant
for the given period), asset-write offs, the elimination of IFRS 16 impact to reflect a rental charge for all leases in
Adjusted EBITDA, prior year ATM rates, tax saving pass throughs, pension buyout losses, asset retirement obligations
(“AROs”) provision release, rental income associated with the Starbucks freehold properties acquired from the EG
UK Acquisition, TSA prepayment unwind costs, the cost of servicing the Ground Rent Facility, the cost of settlement

xvi


-----

share-based payment liabilities, income from one-off legal settlements, one-off colleague incentive payments, one-off
incremental separation costs associated with the implementation of standalone IT infrastructure and integration
payments, restructuring adjustments comprise one off provisions relating to facilities management restructuring, instore bakery proposition restructuring, management and back office restructure and closure of Heston & Dartford
depots, one-off costs relating to the LBO Acquisition, the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition, other
advisor and integration fees, the impact of purchase accounting, restructuring costs from significant restructuring
programmes and an add-back related to the management incentive programme.

**_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_**

Adjusted EBITDA Margin means the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue (including
fuel) for the relevant period.

**_Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA_**

_Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, when used in this Offering Memorandum, means the Group’s Adjusted_
EBITDA for a particular period as adjusted for the impact of the disposal Arthur Business sites following the CMA
decision; synergies from the Arthur Acquisition; annualisation adjustments (based on the actual results for the period
from January 1, 2023 to October 30, 2023 of the Acquired EG UK Target Group (as defined herein)) for the EG UK
Acquisition; synergies from the EG UK Acquisition, and the annualisation of rent costs and servicing costs associated
with the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction.

The Group believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (collectively, the
“EBITDA Measures”) provide useful information to investors about its results of operations for the following
reasons: (a) they are, or will be going forward, among the measures used by the Board of Directors and management
to evaluate the Group’s underlying operating performance, review business trends, identify strategies to improve
results and make day-to-day operating decisions, and (b) they allow a comparison of the Group’s results across periods
and results across companies in the industry in which the Group operates on a consistent basis, by removing the effects
on the Group’s operating performance of its capital structure (such as the varying levels of interest expense), asset
base and capital investment cycle (such as depreciation and amortisation) and items largely outside the control of
management (such as income taxes).

None of the EBITDA Measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of the
Group’s operating performance reported in accordance with UK IFRS. The EBITDA Measures have limitations as
analytical tools, some of which are as follows:

    - the EBITDA Measures do not reflect the Group’s cash expenditures or future requirements for capital
investments or contractual commitments;

    - the EBITDA Measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Group’s working capital
needs;

    - none of the EBITDA Measures reflects the interest expense on the Group’s debt or the cash requirements
necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Group’s debt;

    - although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges, assets are depreciated or amortised over
differing estimated useful lives and the assets being depreciated and amortised will often have to be
replaced in the future, and the EBITDA Measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such
replacements;

    - the EBITDA Measures exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to
the Group;

    - the EBITDA Measures are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in
the Group’s income statement;

xvii


-----

    - other companies in the industry in which the Group operates may calculate their own EBITDA measures
differently than the Group does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures;

    - our calculation and presentation of the EBITDA Measures in this Offering Memorandum is similar to,
but different from, the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior
Facilities Agreement. In particular, EBITDA reflects the adoption of IFRS 16 by the Group effective
January 1, 2019, while Consolidated EBITDA calculations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior
Facilities Agreement may not. Accordingly, the EBITDA Measures do not provide precise indications
as to the level of our adherence to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement; and

    - certain adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA contain
estimates that management believes reflect the underlying results of operations and are therefore
subjective in nature and reflect certain adjustments for anticipated cost savings, synergies and other
estimates that may not be realised, whether in part or at all.

**_Like-for-like sales (excluding fuel)_**

Like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) is a measure of annual growth of sales calculated as current year
comparable sales excluding fuel (excluding VAT) versus prior year comparable sales. Current year comparable sales
includes all revenue except fuel sales, sales generated from stores in the first twelve complete calendar months
following grand opening, sales generated from stores that have permanently closed, sales generated from stores that
have been temporarily closed for more than two consecutive calendar months within the previous twelve full calendar
months, financial services commissions, ‘toyou’ sales and George international franchise sales. Sales are net of Asda
Rewards earned and other discounts. Like-for-like sales growth at category level (food, grocery and merchandise and
clothing) includes an allocation of Asda Rewards earned and discounts to sales, but excludes any allocation of financial
services sales, and breakage on gift cards.

**_Free Cash Flow_**

Free Cash Flow is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditure KPI (excluding capital
expenditure associated with the implementation of a standalone IT infrastructure as we separate from Walmart
(“Project Future”)). The Group uses Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure to monitor cash flow generation.

The Group presents Free Cash Flow because, in the Group’s view, it provides investors with useful
information about the Group’s underlying ability to generate and extract cash flows from its various subsidiaries in
order to make interest and principal payments on the Group’s debt, including the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby.

Free Cash Flow is not a measure of liquidity under UK IFRS and has limitations as an analytical tool, some
of which are as follows:

    - it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures by the Group,
particularly because, in the case of pre-tax free cash flow, the Group’s various tax payment obligations
are not deducted from such measure;

    - it does not deduct cash flows used by the Group in financing activities;

    - it is not a direct measurement of cash flows and attempts to derive and measure the Group’s ability to
service debt from income statement data of the Group. Accordingly, it does not directly correlate to the
actual collection of cash. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not take into account changes in working
capital of the Group that are otherwise factored in when calculating its net cash from operating activities;

    - it does not deduct certain other items settled in cash; and

xviii


-----

    - other companies in the industries in which the Group operates may calculate Free Cash Flow differently
than it does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

Underlying Cash Flow From Operations

Underlying Cash Flow From Operations is calculated as Free Cash Flow plus Movement in Net Working
Capital.

**_Movement in Net Working Capital_**

Movement in Net Working Capital for the year ended December 31, 2022 and year ended December 31,
2023 represents the sum of the movements in trade and other receivables, inventories, trade and other payables, and
provisions as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. Movement in Net Working Capital for the year
ended December 31, 2021 represents the sum of the movements in trade and other receivables, inventories, trade and
other payables, and provisions as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows and which have been
annualised as if the Senior Notes Issuer had consolidated Asda Group Limited and its subsidiaries from January 1,
2021.The Movement in Net Working Capital for the year ended December 31, 2021 has been further adjusted to
remove the impact of business rates of £251 million accrued by Asda Group Limited at December 31, 2020 and paid
in the year ended December 31, 2021.

**_Cash Conversion_**

Cash conversion is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

**_Capital expenditure_**

Capital expenditure is calculated as the purchase of property, plant and equipment plus purchase of intangible
assets.

**_Capital Expenditure KPI_**

Capital Expenditure KPI is defined as the total cost of assets classified as property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets that the Group takes ownership of within a financial period (as opposed to the UK IFRS measurement
of capital expenditure, which is based on cash flows). It excludes capital expenditure on Project Future, our investment
required to separate from Walmart’s IT systems, and timing differences.

**_Pro forma net debt_**

_Pro forma net debt consists of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s pro forma indebtedness in respect of the_
Senior Secured Notes, the Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes (as defined below), the Senior Facilities
and the guarantees relating to the Existing Senior Notes, net of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents as at
December 31, 2023, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions on the Issue Date.
See “Capitalisation.” Pro forma net debt assumes that 100% of holders of targeted Existing Senior Secured Notes
tender in the Richmond Tender Offer. A total of £500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing 3.25%
Senior Secured Notes were not targeted in the Richmond Tender Offer (the “Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior
**Secured Notes”) and will remain outstanding following the Transactions. To the extent that fewer eligible holders**
participate in the Richmond Tender Offer (or such Existing Senior Secured Notes are not accepted by us), pro forma
net debt is not expected to change because we intend to hold the New Financing Proceeds (in cash or cash equivalents)
on balance sheet until applied to repay such Existing Senior Secured Notes (other than the Remaining Existing 3.25%
Senior Secured Notes) that were not subject to, or not tendered or accepted in, the Richmond Tender Offer, which is
currently anticipated to be at the stated maturity in relation to the Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes and at, or soon
after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date in relation to the Existing 4.50% Senior Secured Notes. Our presentation
and calculation of the ratio of Pro forma net debt to Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculation
of Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement and is not indicative of our level
of adherence to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the

xix


-----

Existing Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Facilities Agreement. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”
and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**_Adjusted Net Cash Flow_**

Adjusted Net Cash Flow is defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus capex (excluding Project Future capex)
plus/minus change in net working capital minus Project Future costs (including Future capex) minus net financing
costs plus proceeds from disposals minus other and debt repayment plus cashflows Arthur Acquisition and EG UK
Acquisition.

**_Pro forma net senior secured debt_**

_Pro forma net senior secured debt consists of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s pro forma indebtedness in_
respect of the Senior Secured Notes, the Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Facilities,
net of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2023, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the
consummation of the Transactions on the Issue Date. See “Capitalisation.” Pro forma net senior secured debt assumes
that 100% of holders of targeted Existing Senior Secured Notes tender in the Richmond Tender Offer. The Remaining
Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes will remain outstanding following the Transactions. To the extent that fewer
eligible holders participate in the Richmond Tender Offer (or such Existing Senior Secured Notes are not accepted by
us), pro forma net senior secured debt is not expected to change because we intend to hold the New Financing Proceeds
(in cash or cash equivalents) on balance sheet until applied to repay such Existing Senior Secured Notes (other than
the Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes) that were not subject to, or not tendered or accepted in, the
Richmond Tender Offer, which is currently anticipated to be at the stated maturity in relation to the Existing 3.25%
Senior Secured Notes and at, or soon after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date in relation to the Existing 4.50%
Senior Secured Notes. Our presentation and calculation of the ratio of Pro forma net senior secured debt to Pro forma
Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes
Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement and is not indicative of our level of adherence to the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture or the
Senior Facilities Agreement. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements.”_

**_Pro forma interest expense_**

_Pro forma interest expense represents the interest expense on our pro forma net debt after giving pro forma_
effect to the consummation of the Transactions on the Issue Date. Pro forma interest expense (i) excludes charges
related to allocated debt issuance costs; (ii) excludes finance costs associated with leases (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, leases in connection with the 2021 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and the 2023 Sale and Leaseback
Transactions); (iii) excludes finance costs associated with liabilities relating to the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction;
and (iv) includes interest expense associated with the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, the Remaining Existing
3.25% Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Senior Notes and the Senior Facilities. Pro forma interest expense has been
presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to describe what our interest expense would have actually
been had the above-mentioned transactions occurred at the beginning of the year ended December 31, 2023, nor does
it purport to project our interest expense for any future period or our financial condition at any future date.

**Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures**

We present a reconciliation of the EBITDA Measures, Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, Underlying Cash
Flow From Operations, capital expenditure and Capital Expenditure KPI to the most directly comparable measure
calculated and presented in accordance with UK IFRS and discuss their limitations. For a reconciliation of these
Non-IFRS Measures and such discussions, see “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other

**VALUATION REPORT**

_This Offering Memorandum refers to the CBRE Report with respect to certain of the real estate portfolio_
_owned by Asda. Valuation (including those used in the CBRE Report) are prepared on the basis of various_
_assumptions, estimates and projections. See “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Financial, Reporting and Other_
_Matters—We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in_
_the third-party valuation report of our portfolio of real estate assets are correct, accurate or complete.” Moreover,_
_the number of supermarkets, PFS, Food to Go sites, industrial properties, office properties, investment properties,_
_development and landbank sites and Distribution Centre – Held for Sale, as described in this section and derived from_
_the CBRE Report may differ from the number of stores listed by category in “Business—Our Store Formats.” These_
_differences are primarily due to the fact that the CBRE Report only considers freehold and long leasehold properties_
_and included land and non-trading sites. In contrast, the figures presented in “Business—Our Store Formats”_
_represent ASDA’s active trading footprint across the various categories and therefore includes all leasehold_
_properties and contains certain categorization differences._

**CBRE Report**

We instructed CBRE Limited (“CBRE”) to value our property portfolio (the “CBRE Report”) as of
December 31, 2023 (the “Valuation Date”). The CBRE Report was issued on April 12, 2024 and provides us with a
valuation of the Group’s freehold and long leasehold assets, including our supermarkets, PFS, Food to Go (also
referred to as Foodservice elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum) sites, industrial properties, office properties,
investment properties, development and landbank sites and Distribution Centre – Held for Sale. The CBRE Report
does not include de minimis non-operational parcels of lands or stores, short leaseholds, long leaseholds with no value
(in each case, as assessed by the Group), or a parcel of land at Oldbury which is pending a potential planning appeal
for refusal for residential development. The CBRE Report is intended to be a guide of the likely valuation of our
property portfolio based on a number of assumptions including Special Assumptions (as defined below):

    - _Supermarket Portfolio: Market Value on the Special Assumption that each Property is let to Asda Stores_
Limited at CBRE’s opinion of rental value on a full repairing and insuring basis (“FRI”) for a term of
25 years commencing at the Valuation Date, with annual upward only rent reviews linked to the
consumer price index (“CPI”) with a cap and collar of 1% to 4% per annum.

    - _Industrial Portfolio: Market Value on the Special Assumption of that each Property is let to Asda Stores_
Limited at CBRE’s opinion of rental value on a FRI basis for a term of 20 years, commencing at the
Valuation Date, with five yearly upward only rent reviews to the higher of open market rental value or
CPI subject to, a cap and collar of 2% to 4% per annum (compounded annually).

    - _Offices Portfolio: Market Value on the Special Assumption that each Property is let to Asda Stores_
Limited, at CBRE’s opinion of rental value, on an FRI basis for a term of 15 years, commencing at the
Valuation Date, with five yearly upward only rent reviews linked to CPI, with a cap and collar of 1% to
3% per annum (compounded annually).

    - _Food to Go Portfolio (the Food to Go Portfolio comprises drive through or drive to sites occupied and_
_operated by a Starbucks franchisee): Market Value on the Special Assumption that each Property is let_
to Egspresso Limited in accordance with the terms of the Template Lease provided to CBRE by the
Group, on an FRI basis, and at the current rent payable under licence for each of the sites as confirmed
to CBRE by the Group. The Template Lease is for a term of 20 years, assumed to commence at the
Valuation Date, with three yearly upward only rent reviews linked to the retail prices index with a cap
and collar of 1% to 3%, compounded annually.

For the Supermarket, Industrial, Office and Food to Go Portfolios, CBRE’s opinion of Market Value is
subject to the Special Assumptions outlined above and makes no allowance for tenant incentives such as rent-free
period or capital contributions. It is assumed that a purchaser has no liability with respect to capital expenditure or
repair costs and that Asda Stores Limited (Egspresso Limited for Food to Go Portfolio) is responsible for outgoings
including the payment of business rates and service charges but not the payment of head rents associated with long
leasehold interests (where applicable).

xxxvii


-----

Note for the above where a lease to Asda Stores Limited (Egspresso Limited for Food to Go Portfolio) is
assumed to be in place, the valuations are based on CBRE’s view of the perception of investors to the covenant strength
of Asda Stores Limited (Egspresso Limited for Food to Go Portfolio), as at the valuation date. Any change in the
covenant strength of Asda Stores Limited (Egspresso Limited for Food to Go Portfolio) could have material impact
on the valuation reported.

The Market Value of the Supermarket, Industrial, Office and Food to Go Portfolios, subject to the Special
Assumptions referenced above, will result in valuations which differ from the Market Value of the Properties as at the
valuation date. Should any different special assumption be adopted with respect to the lease, including details such as
tenant covenant, rent, lease length, rent review provisions, repairing provisions (amongst other lease terms) this will
also result in a difference in the valuation.

    - _Petrol Filling Station Portfolio: Market Value. The Petrol Filling Stations have been valued using the_
trading/profits methodology.

    - _Investment Properties: Market Value._

    - _Development and Land Properties: Market Value based on available information provided by the Group._

    - _Wigan DC: Property Held for Sale: Market Value._

The CBRE Report has been undertaken in compliance with the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (the
“RICS”) Valuation Global Standards (the “Red Book”). The CBRE Report is informed by information provided by
the Group.

**Key Findings**

According to the CBRE Report, the aggregate of the individual property Market Values on the assumptions
and Special Assumptions set out above comprised of 402 supermarket properties, 3 industrial properties, 2 office
properties, 359 PFS properties 73 investment properties, 37 development land and landbank properties and 1
distribution centre – held for sale, as of December 31, 2023.

The Properties were valued individually, and no account has been taken of any discount or premium that may
be negotiated in the market if all or part of the portfolio was to be marketed simultaneously, either in lots or as a whole.

The aggregate supermarket portfolio value is substantially higher than average annual investment transaction
volumes in the supermarket sector. The portfolio value could only be realised over an extended period of time in order
to avoid saturating the investment market.

The valuation in the CBRE Report could be significantly higher than the proceeds achievable in an actual
sale of the properties in the portfolio.

The following table sets forth the opinion of Market Value on the assumptions and Special Assumptions set
out above attributed to our properties by portfolio (such properties, the “Market Value SA Properties”), in each case
as of December 31, 2023.

The tables above excludes a portfolio of Properties leased in connection with the 2023 Ground Rent
Transaction which are held by the Group but which are not capable of sale. As no value can be realised from the assets
by the Asda Group, by transactions to a third party, the basis of Market Value does not apply. In this instance an
Investment Value (or Worth) basis has been adopted reflecting the benefit of the ownership to Asda. The aggregate
Investment Value of this portfolio is £756,000,000. The Market Value of the Asda Group interest in the portfolio of
properties where CBRE have reported an Investment Value (or Worth) to Asda is NIL. Investment Value (or Worth)
is defined in the International Valuation Standards as “the value of an asset to a particular owner or prospective owner
for individual investment or operational objectives.”

**Reliance**

The information presented in the CBRE Report is presented for illustrative purposes only. Any information
included in this Offering Memorandum on the basis of the CBRE Report, is presented on a non-reliance basis for
information purposes only. CBRE has accepted no responsibility whatsoever to any third party for the whole or any
part of the contents of the CBRE Report and as such no third party may rely upon the whole or any part of the CBRE
Report.

**Basis of CBRE Report**

The CBRE Report has been prepared on the basis of the use of the relevant Properties, as supermarkets,
industrial, offices, Food to Go Sites, petrol filling stations, investment properties when the CBRE Report was prepared.
The values do not reflect any alternative use, intensification or development of use of these properties. The CBRE

-----

Report determines the value of the relevant properties in their current use under the terms and assumptions set out
below.

In order to provide each opinion of value, certain trading data was provided to CBRE by the Group, where
available for standalone PFSs within the PFS portfolio. No trading data has been provided for supermarkets or petrol
stations connected to supermarkets.

CBRE has relied on floor areas of the relevant properties as provided by Asda. The CBRE Report has been
produced on a desktop basis only without inspection and it is acknowledged that this is a limitation which could impact
the accuracy of the valuations reported. See “—Terms and Assumptions,” “—Methodology” and “—Limitations of
_Valuations” for further assumptions providing the basis of the CBRE Report._

**Overview of the Market**

The CBRE Report contains an overview of the relevant market prepared by CBRE.

_Supermarket Portfolio_

For the year ended December 31, 2023, CBRE Prime Benchmark Supermarket Yields were 175 bps higher
than in June 2022, representing the highest CBRE Benchmark Yield for the sector since 2009. The change in the
CBRE Prime Benchmark Yield occurred between June 2022 and December 2022, and there was no change in 2023.
Some categories of supermarket investment did however experience yield expansion in the second half of 2023,
primarily those assets subject to over-rent and/or with secondary property characteristics.

The CBRE Prime Benchmark Yield does not encompass all categories of supermarket investment but
provides a high-level indication of the impact of market change in this period. Investment yields for supermarket
investments may have changed by a greater or lesser degree than the CBRE Prime Benchmark Yield.

The drivers of yield expansion during this period were:

      - Geo-political risk;

      - Negative Economic Outlook, cautious investor outlook, “Mini-Budget”;

      - Persistent inflationary pressure;

      - Rising Interest Rates leading to higher cost of capital;

      - Selective investor demand with an increased focus on risk and store fundamentals; and

      - Increased sensitivity to over-rent and income risk.

Transaction volumes in 2023 were higher than £2.0 billion, above the five-year average, primarily driven by
three large portfolio transactions. This demonstrated liquidity in the sector but did not result in yield contraction due
to the ongoing price sensitivity outlined above.

**Terms and Assumptions**

The valuation of all properties was based on their current use. CBRE made various assumptions as to tenure,
letting, taxation, town planning, and the condition and repair of buildings and sites (including ground and groundwater
contamination). If any of the information or assumptions on which the valuations are based are subsequently found to
be incorrect, the valuation may also be incorrect and should be reconsidered. Where possible assumptions were
checked against the high-level information made available by the Group.

The valuation assumed that all properties included had the benefit of freehold or leasehold titles, free from
restrictions that would have impacted the value. The valuation assumes that the long leasehold interests contain no
restrictions that would prevent the sale of the relevant properties to a purchaser in the investment market.

xl


-----

The investment properties are generally situated adjacent to Asda supermarkets. The valuation assumes that
either a separate sale of the investment property could be achieved through the creation of a new title, separate from
the retail supermarket or that alternatively the investment property could be sold with the supermarket in the same
transaction.

In particular, in preparation of the CBRE Report, CBRE assumed each property to be the authorised use
under planning legislation and in accordance with the use registered with the relevant regulatory agency. During the
course of their engagement, CBRE did not perform site inspections, environmental audit, tests of services and
amenities, investigations or tests as to the condition of the properties. CBRE did not make planning or permitting
enquiries and did not examine deeds, leases or other documents relating to the title to our properties.

The CBRE Report was produced based on certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, the assumptions
that (i) our properties are not adversely affected by any existing or proposed environmental law and are free from,
environmental issues such as contamination, deleterious materials, flooding, ground conditions, invasive or protected
plants or species and the properties are not adversely affected by any existing or proposed environmental law, (ii)
there are no abnormalities as to repair and condition of the properties, all properties are free from defect, in good repair
and condition and well maintained and in marketable condition, compliant with all building, accessibility and fire
safety regulations and there are no abnormalities as to repair and condition of the properties, (iii) properties possess a
good and marketable freehold title free from any onerous restrictions or conditions, and all title, tenure, lettings,
planning, taxation, statutory and local authority requirements are complied with, (iv) all properties benefit from full
access and egress rights together with sufficient parking and loading facilities and are connected to all main services,
(v) the floor areas supplied by Asda comply with the RICS Code of Measuring Practice (vi) no capital expenditure is
required in respect of the properties and (vii) that the properties all have valid energy performance certificates
compliant with the relevant regulations in each jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.

**Bases of Value and Methodology**

All properties were valued in accordance with the Red Book and on the basis of Market Value, Market Value
subject to Special Assumptions (as outlined above) or “Investment Value (Worth)” as set out above. The RICS
Valuation—Global Standards contains mandatory rules, best practice guidance and related commentary for all
members undertaking asset valuations. These valuation standards define Market Value as “the estimated amount for
which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an
arm’s length transaction after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently, and
without compulsion.” As required by the mandatory rules of the RICS, CBRE has confirmed to us that they do not
have a material conflict of interest when preparing the CBRE Report, and that they adhere to the rules of conduct, as
set out by the RICS.

CBRE determined the Market Value subject to the Special Assumptions outlined above for the Supermarket,
Industrial, Office and Food to Go Portfolios by applying a yield to their assumed rental income. The Market Value of
the Supermarket, Industrial, Office and Food to Go Portfolios, subject to the Special Assumptions referenced above,
will result in valuations which differ from the Market Value of the Properties as at the valuation date. Should a different
special assumption be adopted with respect to the lease, including details such as tenant covenant, rent, lease length,
rent review provisions, repairing provisions (amongst other lease terms) this will result in a difference in the valuation.

For the Supermarket, Industrial and Office Portfolio and Food to Go Portfolios, the Market Value at the
valuation date would be lower than the Market Value subject to the Special Assumptions referenced above. This is
because the Market Value would disregard the lease referenced by CBRE in their Special Assumptions.

CBRE determined the Market Value for the Petrol Filling Station Portfolio utilising the trading/profits
methodology.

Rental values were prepared on the basis of methods adopted by CBRE as appropriate in assessing the Market
Value (subject to Special Assumptions where relevant) and are not necessarily appropriate for other purposes, nor do
they necessarily accord with the definition of Market Rent in the Red Book, which is as follows: “The estimated
amount for which an interest in real property should be leased on the valuation date between a willing lessor and a
willing lessee on appropriate lease terms in an arm’s length transaction, after proper marketing and where the parties
had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.”

Investment Value (or Worth) is defined in International Valuation Standards as “The value of an asset to a
particular owner or prospective owner for individual investment or operational objectives.”

**Defined Terms**

As used in this “Valuation Report” section, “Market Value” means the estimated amount for which an asset
or liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length
transaction, after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without
compulsion; “Properties” means properties owned by the Group; “Special Assumption” means an assumption that
either assumes facts that differ from the actual facts existing at the valuation date or that would not be made by a
typical market participant in a transaction on the valuation date; and “Investment Value (or Worth)” means the value
of an asset to a particular owner or prospective owner for individual investment or operational objectives.

**Overview**

We are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom and the second-largest grocery retailer in the
North of England, Scotland and Wales (in each case in terms of Till Roll data on a 52-week basis as of January 21,
2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We operate a significant store estate of over 1,200 large stores and
convenience sites that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom. We also have the second largest
online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of
January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We are also now a major player in the UK convenience market,
having added 472 convenience sites (including petrol filling stations) to our portfolio, as well as 124 stand-alone
foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites), following the Arthur Acquisition and EG UK Acquisition. These
acquisitions have given us significant foothold in the fast-growing convenience market which, alongside our existing
fuel portfolio, makes us the second-largest independent fuel owner-operator in the United Kingdom. The graph below
compares our total grocery market share with that of other major UK grocery retailers based on Till Roll data for the
52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel.

We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by favourable
macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household expenditure on food and
beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through economic fluctuations. Groceries
are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe generally allows the grocery retail market to
weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market
demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and

1

during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed only by a slight contraction as the pandemic eased. Since, the UK grocery
retail market has experienced consistent growth, achieving a record-high size of £144.0 billion in sales for the 52week period ended December 24, 2023, according to Kantar Worldpanel, despite facing high inflation and global
geopolitical tensions in 2022 and 2023. See also “Industry.”

One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is in turn
centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to offering high quality
products with low prices to our customers and our wholly-owned supplier, International Procurement and Logistics
Ltd (“IPL”), which enables us to take a vertically-integrated approach to procurement and which we believe gives us
a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and
well-established George Clothing and George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers, our
growing presence in the convenience and foodservice market, our popular customer loyalty programme Asda
Rewards, and our team of flexible and engaged colleagues.

We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended December 31,
2023, our revenue was £25.6 billion (including fuel), with 16.5% of sales made online, our net cash flow from
operating activities was £1,245.8 million, our profit for the year was £194.5 million, and our Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA was £1,264 million.

Excluding the results of the EG UK Business, which was acquired on October 31, 2023, and the results of
the Arthur Business, which was consolidated from May 31, 2023, the chart below presents the breakdown of our 2023
revenue by product category (food, general merchandise, clothing and petrol), and channel (stores and online
(including George.com)).

_(Source: Asda information. Year ended December 31, 2023. Note: excluding approximately £588 million from the Arthur Acquisition, £411_
_million from the EG UK Acquisition and £199 million of other revenue from Asda Mobile sales, financial services sales, shipping and wrapping_
_revenue, pharmacy revenue and, until the EG UK Acquisition, Asda On The Move.)_

Our differentiated operating model has resulted in strong financial performance: our successful financial
profile is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital
Expenditure KPI) and cash conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. For
more information on our differentiated operating model, see “—Key Strengths—We benefit from a differentiated
_operating model.”_ Between 2021 and 2023, our average profit margin (defined as profit for the year divided by
revenue) was 4.3%, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.2% (including fuel), our cumulative cash flows from

2


-----

operating activities totalled £3,340.6 million, cumulative free cash flow was approximately £2,097 million and our
average cash conversion was 68%. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial
_Data—Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_

We believe that our business, operating model and financial performance also benefit from our significant
freehold real estate asset portfolio, which also can provide a potential source of liquidity. See “Valuation Report.” In
2023, through the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and 2023 Ground Rent Transaction, we have been able to,
and in the future may continue to, selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to take advantage of
favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities. See “—Lease Agreements.”

We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we maintain
a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom. We have made more than
£300 million annualized price investment since 2022 across over 1,200 lines. Within the UK value market, we have
strong market shares across core grocery products (13.1%), beers, wines and spirits (12.8%), impulse grocery (12.1%),
household and pet (12.1%), frozen (11.4%) and total grocery (11.4%) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute
Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). Our offer is strong across the full
food basket: our category market shares range from 9.6% to 13.1% (except health and beauty)(in each case in terms
of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We
believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal
Asda data, our prices are approximately 2.5% to 6.1% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on the
average of the first eight weeks in 2024, based on total goods price gap percentage). We believe our prices continue
to compete with those of discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. In January 2024, we launched a new price matching
programme where we have price matched Aldi and Lidl on approximately 300 comparable grocery products, which
reduced prices by an average of 17% to match whichever discounter had the lowest price on these products.

Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is supplemented
by a large clothing and general merchandise business. We offer our entire range of food and non-food products to
customers as an accessible “one-stop shop” experience that is supported and enhanced by our strong online offer and
expansion into the convenience market under the Asda Express banner. We believe our omni-channel offer, through
which we reach customers at our brick-and-mortar stores and through our significant online offering and on our app,
appeals to our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic increased use of and engagement with our online platforms. In
the first half of 2021, there were approximately 8.6 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with order growth
from approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended
February 28, 2020) to an average of more than 773,000 weekly orders in 2021 (based on the average weekly orders
for the first 26 weeks of 2021) and a peak of more than 850,000 orders during the third lockdown (based on the seven
days to January 15, 2021). Online engagement has fallen from the peaks experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic,
but we have continued to grow our online business, with an average of approximately 774,000 weekly orders in 2022
and 2023 (based on the average weekly orders in 2022 and 2023). We also offer at-home delivery and customers are
able to collect their purchases at one of approximately 460 Asda Click & Collect sites. Our business model integrates
our store-based and online offer by leveraging our stores to fulfil online orders.

Our online grocery business is profitable within one of the world’s most developed online grocery markets.
According to Kantar Worldpanel, as of January 21, 2024, we operate the second-largest online grocery platform in
the United Kingdom, holding 19.3% of market share (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales),
growing our market share in a market that is 5.5% larger on a one-year basis (comparing Total Grocery Absolute
Online Sales from the 52 weeks ended January 22, 2023 to the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024). Our online business
is already of significant scale; the chart below shows the growth of our online sales, including a breakdown of online
grocery versus George.com sales, for the periods presented.

_(Source: Asda information.)_

According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the third-largest online clothing, footwear and accessories retailer
in the United Kingdom by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024 and we held 8.5% of the total
UK online clothing, footwear and accessories market by volume for the 24 weeks ended January 7, 2024. Combined
sales for our online grocery business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion
(of which £1.5 billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £3.6 billion in
2023 (of which £3.2 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR
of 16.2% between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, our ‘toyou’ service allows customers to conveniently collect and
return orders from George.com and other partner retailers at our stores. We have partnered with 112 brands and
processed more than 4.4 million parcels in the year ended December 31, 2023.

We also have a strong presence in the convenience market with significant opportunity for additional
expansion in this fast-growing sector. In October 2022, we took our first notable step into the convenience market
after acquiring 132 sites including 129 convenience sites attached to forecourts from the Co-op (the “Co-op sites,”
and such business, the “Arthur Business”) and three development sites as part of the Arthur Acquisition. We agreed
to divest 13 of the Co-op sites following the recommendation of the CMA after an Initial Enforcement Order stemming
from its review of the acquisition. The disposals of these sites completed across December 2023 to January 2024 for
proceeds of £25.2 million. Each Co-op site included a grocery retail store between 1,500 and 3,000 square feet of
space and an attached petrol filling station driving footfall. In October 2023, we acquired the majority of EG Group’s
business in the United Kingdom for total cash consideration of £2.1 billion (including transaction fees). The deal
represented a major step in our convenience proposition, adding 356 well-invested PFSs to our convenience portfolio,
161 of which are stand-alone and 195 of which are co-located with foodservice concessions, as well as 124 stand-alone
foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). In foodservice, we acquired franchises for some of the United
Kingdom’s best loved outlets, including Greggs, Subway, Burger King and Sbarro, as well as our own proprietary
brand, Leon. Certain of our acquired sites also continue to benefit from an additional KFC and Starbucks non-Group
branded offerings operated by third parties. Through this acquisition, we accessed another high-growth sector,
foodservice, tapping into a new market which is highly complementary to Asda’s current offering. Each of the acquired
sites are community-focused and strategically located at the heart of residential areas with a diversified footprint across
the United Kingdom, and represent broader retail destinations with ancillary services such as parcel delivery, car wash
and last mile food delivery, with opportunity to expand further. The acquired sites also present a significant

4


-----

opportunity for further synergies across Asda’s business through higher volumes, buying synergies and cost savings
through operational leverage.

In September 2023, we began the conversion of the Co-op sites from Co-op branding to our Asda Express
banner, implementing Asda pricing across fuel and grocery upon conversion. We completed the conversion of the
remaining convenience sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in
March 2024. Total capex investment to convert the stores to Asda Express was approximately £17 million. We believe
we will be able to bring Asda’s great value to even more customers across the United Kingdom by reaching new
communities and shoppers with this smaller store format. In the converted Co-op sites, our Asda Express prices were
an average of 6.1% cheaper than their corresponding prices under Co-op ownership. We also have further organic
Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in 2023 and a strong pipeline of approximately 40 sites that
have been identified for potential opening in 2024. Going forward, our focus will be on the continued integration of
the Co-op sites and EG UK Business into the Asda Group and delivering synergies.

Currently, with our team of approximately 150,000 flexible and engaged colleagues, with around 98,000 fulltime employees, serving approximately 16.8 million customer trips each week (based on the average of weeks 37 to
40 of 2023), we are committed to and deeply invested in the UK food supply chain.

Our business model is supported by diversification. First, we are a mass market retailer that serves the entire
UK population, in terms of both customer demographics and geography, with our customer base skewing slightly
towards value-seeking families, younger shoppers and lower-income customers who are attracted by our strategy to
offer high quality products at low prices and with strong market shares in the North of England, Scotland and Wales.
For more information about our customer mix, see “—Our Customers,” and for more information about the geographic
distribution of our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.” Second, we believe we are well-positioned geographically, with
a strong regional footprint across the United Kingdom. Our store footprint is strongest in the North of England,
Scotland and Wales. Our large and diverse store estate offers customers a variety of differentiated shopping formats.
We operate 30 supercentres, 396 superstores, 153 supermarkets, 30 Asda Living stores, 499 convenience sites
(including our petrol filling stations) and 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). For more
information on our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.”

We continue to benefit from certain support provided by Walmart through the Transitional Agreements,
primarily in relation to the continued use of its IT platform. We have set up a dedicated team to facilitate the transition
of our IT environment away from the Walmart ecosystem and onto a stand-alone IT solution, which we refer to as
Project Future. We believe Project Future presents significant opportunities in terms of our efficiency, data
capabilities, customer experience and competitive edge and are targeting complete separation from Walmart by the
end of 2024. See “—Our Technology and Information Systems,” “Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions—_
_Delays in our ability to separate from Walmart could result in significant cost and any issues with the separation_
_process, particularly related to our transition to a new IT system, could significantly disrupt business operations and_
_impact our ability to meet our strategic objectives.”_

**Key Strengths**

We believe that we benefit from the following strengths, including being a business of significant scale with
a history of resilient performance, a differentiated operating model, a successful financial profile and a significant
asset backing, as further described below.

**_We are a business of significant scale with a history of resilient performance_**

_We operate in a large, historically stable, resilient and growing industry with favourable macroeconomic tailwinds_

We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market, which has demonstrated resilient
performance underpinned by favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence
and household spend on food and beverages. For example, UK GDP growth has shown stable development over the
years. Although the United Kingdom’s GDP declined by 10.4% in 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, GDP rebounded
in 2021, returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2022 and amounted to approximately £2.0 trillion in 2023, according to
Fitch Solutions, with an average expected GDP growth of approximately 0.4% from 2023 to 2025.

The UK grocery retail market is also characterised by favourable demographic characteristics, including a
growing population. According to ONS, the UK population is projected to grow from 67 million in 2021 to over 73
million by 2036, which is expected to result in an overall increase in the consumer base for groceries.

In addition to its historical stability, the UK grocery retail market is also resilient. In 2023, grocery retail was
the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom – valued at £200.5 billion on a Retail Value RSP
(as defined herein) basis, according to Euromonitor. Groceries are a necessary and stable consumer expenditure, which
generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets that
involve more discretionary spending. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest
periods of growth in recent history during and following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the
COVID-19 pandemic: between 2009 and 2016, the UK grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 2.2% and between
2016 and 2023, the UK grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 3.1%, with a growth CAGR of 4.6% during the
COVID-19 pandemic from 2019 and 2020. Additionally, during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, according to
ONS, the percentage of average weekly household spend on food and non-alcoholic drinks remained fairly consistent
at approximately 11.0%, demonstrating the market’s resilience during periods of macroeconomic difficulty, and this
percentage spiked to 14.4% in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting an increase in at-home consumption
during the pandemic. This percentage has remained relatively flat in the intervening years, ranging between 10.5%
and 11.8% from 2007 to 2022. In recent years, as the COVID-19 global pandemic was waning, Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine sparked an energy crisis which further accelerated growing inflation and cost of living pressures. However,
according to Kantar Worldpanel, the UK grocery market, comprised of grocers (and excluding non-grocers), has
grown by 8.7% over the past three years (on a Till Roll basis for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, compared to
the 52 weeks ended January 24, 2021).

_We are the United Kingdom’s third-largest grocer, holding sizeable market share_

According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom, with 13.7%
of market share and the second-largest grocery retailer in the North of England, Scotland and Wales (based on Till
Roll data over 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024). For the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenue was £21.9
billion (excluding fuel). We have a network of over 1,200 large stores and convenience sites throughout the United
Kingdom, with a particular focus on superstores, supermarkets, online formats and convenience. We are also the
second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom by value (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on
a 52-week basis as of January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel), and have grown our market share over
many years, maintaining this share in a much-enlarged market as customers turned to online shopping throughout the
COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we believe that we are well-positioned as a large and established business with a
clear set of peers.

We also believe that our multi-format, omni-channel offer positions us well to compete effectively and to
continue growing our market share. Following the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition, which gave us a
significant foothold in the convenience and foodservice markets, our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended
December 31, 2023 were £25,619.9 million and £1,078 million, respectively, compared to £24,477.8 million and £867
million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that we also hold a leading position in the
UK foodservice market.

We cater to a broad target demographic, which we believe provides us a long-term competitive advantage.
In contrast to discounters, we provide a broad range of branded and own-brand offers, while also having a more
developed and established online platform.

_We believe we have faced the greatest impacts of discounters on our market_

The adverse impact of discounters (primarily Aldi and Lidl) on the traditional grocers in recent years has
been significant but, while we believe that discounters will continue to put pressure on the market, we believe that we
and other traditional grocers have already faced the greatest impacts of this competition in the markets in which we
operate and, if anything, that the discounters pose a greater challenge to other traditional grocers, who we believe are
more geographically exposed to the areas where discounters are likely to focus in the near-term.

As compared to our traditional grocer peers, our geographical concentration is in the North of England,
Scotland and Wales, as evidenced by our number two market shares in those regions. The discounters have already

6


-----

penetrated these areas and we expect the discounters to continue to shift the focus of their expansion to the South of
England, the East of England and London, where we operate fewer sites as compared to the Midlands, the North of
England, Scotland and Wales. Furthermore, the catchment areas of 76.7% of our stores already contain both major
discounters, Aldi and Lidl, which is a higher percentage than any of our traditional grocer competitors (the boundary
used is a 10-minute drive-time radius around each point, which is consistent regardless of location type or size of
store, but excludes convenience stores, and stores are only included in the count where there is both Aldi and Lidl
stores present within the drive-time boundary). Therefore, we believe that our current performance already factors in
the adverse impact of discounters to a large extent.

Moreover, according to Kantar Worldpanel, we have stemmed the losses to the discounters in recent months,
and we have reduced switching losses to the discounters to a two-year record low for the 4 weeks ended February 18,
2024. Together, Lidl and Aldi account for 17.5% of the market, with Aldi’s share at 9.8% and Lidl at 7.6% in each
case on the basis of Till Roll data and according to Kantar Worldpanel for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024.
However, the growth experienced by the discounters has begun to fall sharply, with Aldi posting growth behind the
market for the four weeks ended January 21, 2024, and Lidl’s growth decreasing over 50% for the same period
compared to the four weeks ended January 22, 2023.

We also believe we can reduce losses to the discounters through our value proposition, including our opening
price point range, Just Essentials. In January 2024, we also launched a new price matching programme where we have
price matched Aldi and Lidl on 287 comparable grocery products, which reduced prices by an average of 17% to
match whichever discounter had the lowest price on these products.

_We have demonstrated resilience through downturns_

Just as our market has proven resilient in times of economic difficulty and uncertainty, our business has also
proven resilient during recent economic and market downturns, including during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis,
the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as through the rise of discounters in the UK grocery retail market in more recent
years, particularly during 2014 to 2016. During the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, we continued to perform well,
achieving an average like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) growth rate of 6.1% for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2008 and 2009. Our EBITDA margins have also remained stable, ranging from 4.7% to 4.9% between 2007 and 2023.

Despite the significant social and economic shifts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, our business
experienced strong overall performance, particularly in our online and supermarket formats. Overall, our food business
performed consistently throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an initial increase in sales due to panic buying
and customers stocking-up on key staples at the outset of each of the first three lockdown periods. Following an initial
decline at the beginning of the first lockdown, our general merchandise business also generally performed well
throughout these lockdown periods, due to increasing purchases of homeware products. While our clothing business
was initially negatively impacted during the early stage of the first UK lockdown period, we experienced improved
performance in this business in line with an overall improvement of the general economy and a rebound in consumer
confidence.

Recently, geopolitical tensions and ongoing inflation above historical norms and the Bank of England’s target
have led to uncertainty in the market and for our consumers. However, we have remained highly resilient in the face
of these challenges and have kept focused on supporting customers and colleagues with cost-of-living pressures, whilst
continuing to deliver strong financial results. During times of economic stress, we believe our value proposition is
particularly appealing to customers and can drive sales: we benefited from increased sales generating revenue
(excluding fuel) of £21.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to £20.4 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2021. As the current high inflationary environment persists, we are focused on initiatives to support our
customers in the cost-of-living crisis and protect market share by investing in price and quality, which we believe can
drive growth. For example, in 2022, we also launched our new grocery opening price point range, Just Essentials by
Asda that expands the range of its predecessor, Asda Smart Price, from approximately 160 to 272 products with new
branding and reformulations for taste and quality. In the same year, we also rolled out a “Dropped and Locked” price
campaign, where we locked in the prices of over 100 grocery items to give customers certainty around their shopping
costs during the year, as well as our loyalty rewards programme, Asda Rewards, as an indirect cost-saving scheme for
customers to earn cash back on their shopping.

**_We benefit from a differentiated operating model, including a diversified proposition with unique multi-format and_**
**_multi-channel offering_**

_We have well-developed own-brands_

We believe that our own-brand offers have been a key strength of our business and continue to offer growth
opportunities. We have an extensive own-brand product range in our food business, with approximately 7,800
own-brand SKUs. Our approach to range development and innovation enables us to identify and meet changing
customer needs and has resulted in the creation of many award-winning products; we launched approximately 950
lines in 2021, 1,547 new lines in 2022 and 1,597 new lines in 2023, and approximately 3,858 lines were reformulated
in 2023. As a result of the EG UK Acquisition, we also acquired Leon, our own proprietary foodservice brand. In
addition to our diverse and extensive product offer with our own-brand range, we have also been able to drive growth
through service and price positioning. We leverage our IPL sourcing model to deliver value, especially in our produce,
cooked meats and wine segments. In particular, the introduction and development of the opening price point range,
Just Essentials, has been key to helping customers with the cost-of-living pressures in 2023 after the “Dropped and
Locked” price campaigns in 2022, where we locked in the prices of over 100 grocery items to give customers certainty
around their shopping costs during that year. We also offer own-brands through George, see “—The George Clothing
_and George Home offers are generally profitable and well-established.”_

_We are driven by our commitment to delivering low prices to our customers_

We believe our commitment to delivering low prices to our customers is a competitive advantage as we aim
to lead on price while staying competitive on assortment and quality. We believe that we are the least expensive
full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal Asda data, our prices are approximately
2.5% to 6.1% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on average for the first eight weeks in 2024,
based on total goods price gap percentage). Following the implementation of our Aldi and Lidl price matching
programme, which runs alongside our established customer value propositions, including Just Essentials, Asda Smart
Price, our price locking campaigns, Fab 5 and Asda Rewards, we believe our prices can compete with those of
discounters. Our low prices are supported by rigorous cost control and a commitment to affordability, which enables
us to control expenses so that we can pass cost savings on to our customers.

_Loyal customer base through our reward loyalty programme, Asda Rewards_

In 2022, we launched our new loyalty programme, Asda Rewards. The app-based scheme enables customers
to earn cash back on their shopping, building Asda Pounds in their cash pots to spend in store. The programme also
provides the opportunity to leverage data insights which enables us to better target investment in the customer
proposition. Asda Rewards total users and penetration among customers has grown quickly, with over 7.5 million new
users joining over the last 12 months and a total of 1.6 million members who have registered for Blue Light. The
number of total active customers reached 4.9 million as of December 31, 2023 over the prior 30-day period, and the
programme has earned around £300 million revenue in 2023.

-----

The following graph shows the increasing sales penetration, or the number of sales linked to customers using
Asda Rewards since its inception, which reached 50.6% in the week of Christmas in 2023:

By the end of 2023, we saw approximately 47% of sales linked to Asda Rewards. We have found that after
joining Asda Rewards, members spend more than non-members within every segment and are more likely to become
repeat customers. In particular, we believe that members spend more than 10% after joining the programme (measured
through tokenised payment cards) and for our high value customers, we believe that this equates to an incremental
addition of approximately £11 per week. By driving sales volume, the loyalty scheme has been incrementally
profitable since shortly after its launch, and the Retail Media segment has achieved £103.1 million profit. The
following graph shows the average sales by quarter of Asda Rewards members versus non-members.

_We operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, which is profitable_

The United Kingdom has one of the most developed online grocery retail markets in the world, with one of
the highest rates of the population using the internet. There has been a significant shift in the grocery retail market
away from brick-and-mortar stores to online purchasing as demographic trends, greater mobile and device usage,
improved service proposition and technological advances in applications and customer interfaces have driven

9


-----

increasing penetration rates in the online grocery retail market. We believe we are poised to take advantage of these
favourable consumer trends, as we have already established ourselves in the rapidly growing UK online grocery retail
market and our store and warehouse footprint is strategically positioned across attractive geographic areas to service
the growing demand for groceries online.

According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the second-largest online grocery retail platform in the United
Kingdom, holding 19.3% of market share (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) for the 52-week period ended
January 21, 2024. Having responded quickly to the increase in demand for online shopping during the COVID-19
pandemic, we have continued to grow our online business, with an average of approximately 774,000 weekly orders
in 2022 and 2023 (based on the average weekly orders in 2022 and 2023). As a result of our strong performance in
the online market, combined sales for our online grocery business and George.com rapidly increased from previous
years to a total of £3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 (of which £3.2 billion were online grocery sales
and £0.4 billion were George.com sales) as compared to £3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 (of which
£2.9 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales). According to Kantar Worldpanel, we
hold an 8.5% share of the UK online clothing, footwear and accessories market (in terms of volume of units sold on a
24-week basis as of January 7, 2024).

We believe there is greater scope for our online profitability to improve further. We expect that the demand
for online groceries will continue to be strong as customers increasingly adopt online shopping as a more permanent
and preferred way to purchase groceries.

_The George Clothing and George Home offers are generally profitable and well-established_

We launched our clothing offer, George, in 1990 and it is the third-largest clothing footwear and accessories
retailer in the United Kingdom by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024 and is the leading UK
childrenswear retailer with 18.7% market share by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024, in
each case according to Kantar Worldpanel. Despite challenges to this product category overall, our online clothing
sales have increased from £379.3 million for the year to December 31, 2021 to £423.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023, with 82% of all sales made via mobile devices in 2023. We believe this demonstrates our strength
in the online segment, which is a key part of our operating model. Additionally, we have expanded the George branded
offer to include general merchandise, including through collaborations with strategic partners. We have extended
product ranges with partners who specialise in certain categories, have a strong affinity fit with our existing customers
and bring complementary expertise and reputation, such as in homeware with Stacey Solomon and Claire’s in
jewellery and accessories. The George Home brand generated approximately £747.7 million in sales and contributed
approximately 50.0% of our total general merchandising sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. Sales by the
George Home brand grew at a CAGR of approximately 3% between the years ended December 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2023. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product categories generally have higher
margins than our food product categories.

**_We benefit from a well invested and vertically integrated model and are supported by a significant asset base_**

_We benefit from vertically integrated procurement through IPL_

We believe that we have a competitive advantage in food sourcing via our captive sourcing arm, IPL, which
enables us to take a vertically integrated approach to procurement. We believe that IPL provides us with valuable
sourcing differentiation as compared to our competitors. IPL is one of the largest importers of produce in the United
Kingdom and, while IPL is a group company and exclusively serves Asda, it is also our largest supplier. The aim of
our vertically integrated procurement model is to consolidate import activity for key products and reduce our overall
costs. In 2023, we purchased £1,724 million of our products through IPL. The foundation of IPL’s cost-price advantage
is that it eliminates the “middleman” who typically serves as the intermediary in the supply chain, thereby giving us
greater control of costs, quality and supply of a diverse range of products. We have an extensive IPL footprint across
the United Kingdom, with nine processing facilities across the country and more than 3,793 colleagues as of the year
ended December 31, 2023. Our IPL product mix is diversified according to our needs, with a mix of 56% fruit and
vegetables, 28% protein, 7% plants and flowers, 6% beverages and 3% grocery in 2023. Additionally, we have been
able to build upon and benefit from our supplier relationships to deliver supply chain continuity and make progress in
our sustainability agenda. For example, through IPL we are supporting industry projects on water stewardship in our
produce supply chain.

10


-----

We also believe that IPL has provided greater stability and allowed us greater control over our supply chain
now that the United Kingdom has left the European Union’s single market and customs union. IPL’s EU supply chain
ensures IPL takes control of the transport direct from its suppliers’ sites. This allows IPL to appoint experts in haulage
and freight clearance, removing delays at the various border control points and ensuring the most efficient supply
chain. IPL’s logistics team are based in Spain, which is the top EU exporting country into the United Kingdom for
fresh produce. This has ensured IPL quickly understands any impacts to supply chains, such as localised disruption
by the farming fraternity, allowing IPL to take actions to protect the supply chains.

_We are supported by a significant asset portfolio_

We are supported by a well-invested and geographically diversified store estate and benefit from a total real
estate portfolio of £8.5 billion, which is comprised of freehold and long leasehold assets, and includes £756 million
of certain properties owned by the Group but pledged as collateral for the benefit of the creditors under the Ground
Rent Facility.

As of December 31, 2023, 77% of our asset portfolio was comprised of freehold or long leaseholds, based
upon attributable EBITDAR per property (less central allocations), with certain adjustments made to align the
calculation methodology across the Group’s properties following the EG UK Acquisition and the Arthur Acquisition.
Of this 77%, 12% is attributable to certain properties that are pledged as collateral for the benefit of the creditors under
the Ground Rent Facility.

Our valuable real estate portfolio also provides a potential source of liquidity and underpins our strong
ongoing cash flow generation. On August 10, 2023, we completed the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions with
Realty Income, which resulted in proceeds of £646 million that were used to finance a portion of the EG UK
Acquisition. On December 12, 2023, we also completed the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction with a number of investors,
which resulted in proceeds of £400 million that were used to repay a bridge loan that was used to finance a portion of
the EG UK Acquisition. In the future we may continue to selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to
take advantage of favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—2023 Sale and Leaseback Facility” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Ground Rent Transactions – Ground Rent Facility.”_

**_We have strong exposure to the resilient convenience and PFS channel with upside through synergies_**

In December 2022, we opened our first two convenience sites under the Asda Express banner. We also have
further organic Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in early 2024 and a strong pipeline of
approximately 30 sites that have been identified for potential opening in 2024.

The Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition gave us a strong presence in the fast-growing
convenience market, having added 472 convenience sites and petrol filling stations to our portfolio. The Arthur
Acquisition comprised 116 convenience stores with PFSs attached and the EG UK Acquisition comprised 356 PFSs
(including two that have since been shut) with convenience stores and 124 standalone foodservice sites (including 10
non-active sites). These acquisitions accelerated our growth in the convenience sector and strategic ambition to bring
our value heritage as a consumer champion to even more customers. We completed the conversion of all the sites
acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in March 2024. See also “—
_Business Strategy—Location.” We believe our recent acquisitions will drive our results by delivering additional net_
working capital and EBITDA synergies as we integrate buying for the wider convenience network into Asda and seek
to drive higher volumes and growth as a result of price investment in the fuel and grocery offering. We also expect
synergies to arise from range optimisation, monetisation of customer data, our increased scale, in-store marketing
income, improvement in fuel card terms and operational efficiencies. See “Summary Historical Consolidated
_Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_

According to Euromonitor, in 2023, the UK convenience market was approximately £44 billion and the UK
foodservice market was approximately £67 billion, and the UK convenience market has grown at a faster rate than the
UK grocery retail market relative to 2015. Our exposure to these highly attractive and profitable convenience and
foodservice markets is underpinned by favourable structural factors including (i) the rise of shopping locally, (ii) the
evolution of shopper missions, (ii) the shift of our offering to a broader format of retail destinations, and (iv) our shift
into the foodservice and consumption market.

**_We have achieved a successful financial profile_**

We have achieved a successful financial profile that is underpinned by strong profit margins, Adjusted
EBITDA margins, cash flows from operating activities, Free Cash Flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital
Expenditure KPI) and Cash Conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years.
Between the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2023, our average profit margin (defined as profit for the year
divided by revenue) was 4.3%, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.2% (including fuel), our cash flows from
operating activities totalled £3,340.6 million, cumulative free cash flow was approximately £2,097 million and our
average cash conversion was 68%. This strong financial performance is driven by our commitment to deliver low
prices to our clients, diverse product offer, strong own-brand grocery offer, expanded convenience and foodservice
offerings and well-established George-branded product categories. Our Adjusted EBITDA margins have benefitted
from our cost transformation programmes, which have generated SG&A cost savings without compromising the low
prices we offer our customers.

We are a structurally negative working capital business driven by growth in payables, and the beneficial
payment terms to suppliers versus payments received by consumers instantly on purchase. We delivered a strong net
working capital performance in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, with our active working capital
management, resulting in increased working capital inflows in those two years. Furthermore, we have pursued a
disciplined approach to our capital expenditure over time, with the aim of maintaining and improving our real estate
platform rather than opening new sites.

**_We have a highly experienced and execution focused management team_**

We are led by an experienced, entrepreneurial management team that is committed to continuing our strong
track record of growth, with a focus on product quality, delivering low prices to our customers and exceptional
customer service. Together with Michael Gleeson, the Group’s chief financial officer, our executive committee
provides strong, dynamic and deep, leadership. We also benefit from the long-standing experience, market expertise,
business relationships and industry know-how of our shareholder, Mohsin Issa, who is leading the management team
on an interim basis.

As we continue to expand our footprint and achieve our business goals, we plan to take advantage of
opportunities to further enhance and supplement our management talent, both from inside our organisation as well as
with external candidates. We have made key investments into our digital marketing team and expect to onboard a new
chief digital officer in the third quarter of 2024. Our search for a permanent chief executive officer is robust and
ongoing.

**Business Strategy**

Our primary strategy is designed to provide great value for money and to bring brighter living within
everyone’s reach. Our strategy is centred around four primary pillars which guide our business priorities and planning:
proposition, product, location and experience. These pillars are underpinned by our commitment to running an
efficient operating model, driving the business through improved data and systems and an ESG programme that builds
a sustainable business for the long term.

Through our strategy, we seek to maintain and extend our advantage in offering value for money by ensuring
that our prices are competitive and reassuring shoppers on quality. We aim to provide a consistent, trusted experience,
incentivising customers not to shop elsewhere through the creation of attractive store propositions and partnerships
that increase our appeal to customers. We serve our customers with our team of flexible and engaged colleagues, while
increasing the number of self-serve opportunities and transforming the in-store experience. We focus our growth
where customers care, expanding our addressable markets in online grocery, wholesale and community convenience.

We believe that our strategy provides a clear path to achieve our ambition of becoming the second-largest
grocer in the United Kingdom by market share.

12


-----

**_Proposition_**

Our proposition strategy is about creating more reasons to shop with us than anywhere else and providing an
offering that meets all of our customers’ needs under one roof. Demonstrating the strength in our offering across the
store, we recently won four awards at the 2023 annual Grocer Gold Awards, including the Grocer 33 Price award for
the 26th consecutive year, the ‘Own Label Range of the Year’ award for our Just Essentials product range, the
‘Consumer Initiative of the Year’ award for our Kids Eat for £1 Cafe Meals scheme and ‘Online Supermarket of the
Year.’

We believe we are well established as the lowest-price full-selection retailer in the United Kingdom, and we
lead the traditional grocers in terms of lowest price. Moving forward, we intend to reduce the complexity of the
customer shopping experience so that we can reflect that benefit to customers’ prices where it matters most in our
value proposition. We aim to simplify our value proposition to maintain price leadership, further improve quality
perception and continue to improve customer experience in-store and online. We also strive to create a more
hassle-free customer experience in-store with our digital transformation. For example, we have broadened our
Scan&Go services that allows customers to use a handset or the Scan&Go mobile app to scan and bag items as they
shop and utilise a dedicated checkout area for quick and easy payment.

We have also transformed our approach to rewarding customer loyalty through the launch of Asda Rewards
in 2022, our innovative, app-based loyalty scheme that gives customers Asda pounds, not points. Customers earn cash
back on their shopping, with regularly updated missions and star products enabling extra savings. Since 2022, more
than 5 million of our customers enrolled in Asda Rewards and as of December 31, 2023, Asda Rewards resulted in a
total of £383 million customer savings since it was first trialled. Following this initial success, we plan to look into
different ways to offer even further value to our customers, “gamefy” the application and to monetise and utilise the
data it provides. We believe that this approach will allow us to grow our customer analytics platform to bring better,
faster and deeper customer insights to our investment decisions and to improve the overall customer experience by
personalising our offer.

Through Asda Rewards, we are also able to roll out seasonal offerings such as our Christmas Saver Cashpot
that enabled customers save up their cash pot earnings in preparation for the festive period, with approximately 1.7
million members saving approximately £50 million into their 2023 Christmas Cashpots. We offered saving incentives
where customers who transferred savings earned from their Asda Rewards cash pot into their Christmas Saver Cashpot
received additional cash bonuses based upon the amount transferred. With improved availability and seasonal
offerings, we continue to earn our place in customers’ minds as the retailer for key celebrations throughout the year.
We believe that such rewards incentives will further drive customer loyalty and retention.

In non-food, we have begun trialling a number of initiatives across clothing and general merchandise in our
“lab stores.” We use the lab-store as a platform to test new technologies, concepts and ideas and assess what works
for customers and colleagues. For example, we tested a “shop within a shop” concept with our Big Asda Toyshop,
which had its own merchandising and look and feel, in eight stores in 2022. Following strong sales, we have rolled it
out in an additional 121 stores. For Halloween in 2023, we trialled a new approach to the store entrance, creating an
inviting and festive shopping environment. Through these and other concepts, we have overhauled the in-store
shopping experience, radically rethinking our use of space, lighting and merchandising and are looking at how to
replicate with new themes and categories on a regular basis across the portfolio.

We also aim to grow Asda as a platform by forming partnerships that enable us to provide a broader set of
relevant branded products and services, while also building upon our existing capabilities, such as logistics and our
customer-facing ‘toyou’ proposition. We believe adding partners to our platform will result in the creation of appealing
“one-stop-shop” store destinations for more customer missions. We believe these partnerships will not only provide
additional income through rent and revenue share models but will also create a positive effect on our overall business.

**_Product_**

Our goal under our product strategy is to make desirable products affordable. We aim to modernise our brand
and deliver the best value to our customers, helping them fulfil their money saving goals without needing to
compromise on quality.

13


-----

We began our product transformation in 2022 with the overhaul of our opening price point range, Just
Essentials by Asda. This line is a key part of our strategy to make desirable products that are affordable. In 2023, we
also locked in the price of over 500 popular products until the end of the summer to give customers certainty around
their budgets. We delivered three key price drops in 2023, lowering the prices on over 800 high volume lines, including
in October 2023 where we lowered prices by an average of 14% on many of our popular products. We will look to
continue dropping prices where possible and aim to pass price drops straight onto customers where we can. As inflation
is starting to ease in certain areas, we are working with our suppliers and IPL to ensure our customers feel the benefit
of those reductions.

As part of this brand reset, we are also focused on our mid-tier value and range offerings, investing throughout
our own brand offering to drive customers to reappraise us on quality. We launched our new scratch cooking and meal
solutions ranges and have introduced new own-label meal solutions brands, including Health Menu, Take-Out Club,
the Indian-inspired Bom Bahia and pan-Asian-inspired House of Yum ranges, and Bistro, a selection of hearty
pub-style favourites. These ranges are designed to compete directly with the likes of M&S Gastropub and takeaway
brands, a key opportunity as customers switch to at-home spending amidst cost-of-living pressures. We launched
ambitious quality and taste match campaigns during 2023 to demonstrate our confidence in the quality and value of
our products, including Harrod’s blind taste test products and M&S Taste Match campaign across a range of popular
household items. In the M&S Taste Match campaign, hundreds of our products were voted “as tasty” or “tastier than”
their M&S equivalents, but at a lower cost, in a blind taste testing conducted by Cambridge Market Research.

Foodservice and chilled categories also represent an avenue for growth and are important in moving the dial
on customers’ quality perception. A strong proposition in these categories is essential for fulfilling our ambition of
becoming a key market player in the convenience market.

In non-food, we launched ‘Exclusively at George’ in May 2023, which was dubbed the first-ever supermarket
elevated fashion collection. It put a spotlight on high-quality fabrics, with a focus on both quality and style. Following
the success of ‘Exclusively at George,’ we introduced the Studio Edit, which will be a permanent premium arm of the
George range, with a focus on wardrobe staples, premiere fabrics and finishing touches typically found in more
expensive pieces. Continuing in the elevated lifestyle space, we partnered with TV presenter and influencer Stacey
Solomon to create the homeware range, ‘At Home with Stacey Solomon Exclusively for George Home’ in
August 2023. We believe these lines showcase our ability to deliver high quality, highly desired products across a
broad range of categories to meet our customers’ every day needs.

**_Location_**

As part of our location strategy, we seek to be accessible however and whenever we are needed. We believe
that customers seeing Asda in new locations and new formats will help us broaden our customer base. In 2022, we
made significant progress in our location strategic priority area, increasing our expansion into the convenience sector.
Our core focus in our location strategy is on the successful integration of the recent Arthur Acquisition and EG UK
Acquisition, which together added 472 convenience sites and petrol filling stations and 124 standalone foodservice
sites to our portfolio.

In September 2023, we began the conversion of the Co-op sites from Co-op branding to our Asda Express
banner, implementing Asda pricing across fuel and grocery upon conversion. We completed the conversion of the
remaining convenience sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in
March 2024. We believe we will be able to bring Asda’s great value to even more customers across the United
Kingdom by reaching new communities and shoppers with this smaller store format. In the converted Co-op sites, our
Asda Express prices were an average of 6.1% cheaper than their corresponding prices under Co-op ownership. We
also have further organic Asda Express openings planned to bolster our location strategy. Going forward, our focus
will be on the continued integration of the Co-op sites and EG UK Business into the Asda Group and delivering
synergies.

Beyond our expansion into the convenience market, we plan to continue to drive growth and market share
gains in the online channel through the expansion of our online grocery channel’s capacity to meet increased consumer
demand. We continue to seek to optimise our online grocery operating model and further develop our already
profitable economic model through the ongoing assessment of our online product range and promotions, further
monetisation of our e-commerce assets, as well as other initiatives. In addition to growing our core online grocery

14

business, we are targeting further growth by expanding the reach of our online platform and expanding our delivery
services. We expect to provide customers with greater and more convenient access to our product range by accelerating
our last-mile delivery capabilities via partnerships.

**_Experience_**

The goal of our experience strategy is to make shopping with us easy and enjoyable. We are focused on
operational excellence, testing scalable operational innovation for end-to-end service improvement. We are currently
looking at changes to further improve availability in store, improve stock flow and drive effective labour management.
For example, we are trialling artificial intelligence (“AI”) cameras to identify gaps in product availability and optimise
stock management in store. We believe this is an example of how AI could significantly help improve the customer
experience and optimise our colleagues’ time to focus on delivering high quality service.

We are also striving towards a best-in-class shopping experience that gives customers the range they desire
in an environment that’s easy to navigate. Our current store design had not been updated for many years, so our
near-term strategy includes modernising our stores to facilitate a better customer journey.

In order to ensure our colleagues are equipped to offer a best-in-class customer experience, we are also
investing in colleague hours in-store via a combination of additional temporary colleagues in stores and opportunities
for existing colleagues to work over-time if they wish to. Increasing the numbers of hours being worked in store means
that more colleagues are on hand to serve customers across the busy and peak periods (such as Christmas). Alongside
value and choice, we believe that service is a key quality signifier for customers and impacts where they choose to
shop. To help further this strategy, we also hired David Hills as our new Chief Customer Officer in September 2023,
who brings a wealth of retail and grocery-sector experience to our business and will play a pivotal role in providing
our shoppers a hassle-free and pleasurable experience when shopping at Asda.

**_Commitment to ESG targets and building a sustainable business for the long term_**

Part of our strategy is to ensure our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) commitments are fully
integrated into our wider business transformation plans. We believe the sales opportunity driven by eco-active
shoppers, or shoppers who are highly concerned about the environment and are actively taking actions to reduce their
waste, is expected to reach approximately £2 billion across the market by the year 2027. We believe ESG is a key
decision enabler for customers in deciding where to shop and that setting the right ESG plan is beneficial for our
customers, colleagues and investors.

Our ESG strategy is focused on four pillars: healthy and sustainable choices (providing our customers with
a product mix that is healthier and with a lower environmental impact), energy and climate change mitigation
(reducing our greenhouse gas emissions), nature positive (sourcing and farming which respects and restores) and waste
(reducing food, product and packaging waste). In August 2023, we published our third ESG report (based on 2022
data), which provided an annual update on the progress we had made towards supporting these pillars and meeting
our environmental targets and in October 2023, we received our first external assessment of our ESG strategy, with
an entity score of 54 points and an overall rating of 3 (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the strongest) by the financial
services ratings’ agency Sustainable Fitch. Sustainable Fitch positively assessed our human and labour rights policies,
gender balanced workforce and well-defined management systems, as well as our actions to increase the share of
non-high fat, salt and sugar own-brand products and improve food nutrition labelling. Obtaining this rating is part of
our ongoing commitment to transparently reporting on our efforts to achieve our ESG targets. For example, we have
continued to reduce our operational carbon footprint, with emissions down 8% from 2021 to 2022 and 40% from 2015
to 2022, and we believe we are well on the way to achieving our commitment to reduce emissions 50% by 2025 and
reaching net zero emissions by 2040. We have committed to setting a near-term science-based carbon reduction target,
including a specific Forests, Land and Agriculture (“FLAG”) target. These targets have been submitted to the
Science-Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”) for validation. The proposed targets were submitted before the Arthur
Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition so reflect our footprint prior to these acquisitions.

In terms of waste reduction, over 90% of our own brand packaging was recyclable in 2022, and we donated
over 2,000 tonnes of surplus food through our charity partnerships, both reducing waste and supporting those in need
during challenging times. We increased the proportion of our own-label packaging that can be recycled at the kerbside
to 88% (with a further 4.7% recyclable in store) and introduced the Refill Price Guarantee on our in-store refill zones,

15


-----

guaranteeing that unpackaged products are cheaper than their packaged equivalents. We reused or repurposed 86% of
our operational waste and sent zero operational waste to landfill in 2022.

We believe we have made significant progress towards our ESG goals but that there is still much to do, and
we will continue working to build a sustainable business for the long term.

**History**

Headquartered in Leeds, we are an omni-channel retailer across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. We have built our business on listening to our diverse range of customers, offering what they need at the best
value and bringing innovation to the UK market.

We were founded in 1965 through the merger of the Asquith family grocery business with the Associated
Dairies company in Yorkshire. Our name is derived from this historic merger, combining “Asquith” and “Dairies” to
form “Asda.”

Founded in the North of England, we have a rich history, heritage and culture. The Asquith family has deep
ties to the grocery business, W.R. Asquith having run a butcher’s shop in Knottingley, West Yorkshire, which
eventually expanded to seven shops. W.R. Asquith’s sons, Peter and Fred, went on to create the United Kingdom’s
first self-service supermarket in Castleford, introducing food discounting to the UK grocery market, and eventually
co-founded Asda. In parallel to the growth of the Asquith family business, a group of West Riding dairy farmers joined
forces, eventually becoming Associated Dairies & Farm Stores Limited led by Arthur Stockdale. Arthur’s son, Sir
Noel Stockdale, went on to co-found Asda with Peter and Fred Asquith.

In 1965, we acquired GEM, a major U.S. discount retailer operating in the United Kingdom. With the
addition of general merchandise to the former GEM stores, we introduced the superstore to the UK market, a landmark
event in the development of UK retailing. To complement this offer, Peter Asquith also introduced the first discounted
petrol filling station.

By 1970, we operated over 30 stores and were poised to expand beyond our original home in the North of
England. Throughout the 1970s, we grew our presence in the South of England, opening stores in Newport, Plymouth
and Gosport. In 1977, we launched our “Asda Price” TV adverts, featuring the “pocket tap” which came to be the
official sign language for Asda. By the end of the 1970s, we were operating over 80 stores and opened our 100[th] store
in 1981.

Throughout the 1980s, we focused on expanding our distribution capabilities, opening seven new distribution
centres strategically located throughout the United Kingdom by 1985. In 1987, our flagship Watford store opened,
another landmark in UK retailing, and featured the longest-ever checkout bank at the time, with 45 checkouts. In 1988,
we opened our headquarters in Leeds, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher overseeing the opening ceremonies. In
1989, George Davies was asked to produce a line of clothing for us that was high-quality, high-value and had its own
identity: the pioneering George brand was born.

In the 1990s, we developed the Asda Way of Working, an innovative framework for a new organisational
structure that focuses on our stores and promotes colleague involvement, which set the stage for the Asda culture of
today. In 1996, we opened our first Asda Pharmacy location in Harrogate, North Yorkshire and launched our “Tickled
Pink” campaign to raise money for the fight against breast cancer, a partnership that continues to this day. In 1998,
we began our online retail operations with a dedicated depot in Croydon.

In 1999, we joined the Walmart family, becoming part of the world’s largest retailer. Throughout the early
2000s, we continued to grow and innovate, expanding our online and Click & Collect offers, opening our first Asda
Living store and our first Eco Store, winning awards for the value we offer customers as well as for the positive
environment we create for colleagues, launching our Free From and Extra Special offers, launching stand-alone PFSs
as well as Asda Opticians. In 2015, we celebrated our 50[th] birthday and George’s 25[th] birthday. Asda has continued to
innovate, including the United Kingdom’s first parcel tower, which allows customers to collect online orders in less
than 60 seconds, and voice-activated shopping through Google Home.

-----

In October 2020, the Issa Brothers and TDR Capital reached an agreement with Walmart to acquire a majority
stake in Asda, with Walmart retaining an equity interest in the business. Following regulatory approval, the deal closed
in February 2021 and our new owners were able to take operational control in June 2021.

In October 2022, we took our first significant step into the convenience market and acquired 116 convenience
sites from the Co-operative Group (“Co-op”) as part of the Arthur Acquisition, expanding our community-focused
reach of retail destinations and petrol filling station driving footfall in strategic locations at the heart of residential
areas.

On October 31, 2023, we greatly expanded our footprint in the convenience market and completed the
purchase of the majority of the EG UK business for total cash consideration of £2.1 billion (including transaction
fees), adding a total of 480 sites to our portfolio (consisting of 356 petrol filling stations, two of which have since
closed, and 124 foodservice sites) through the EG UK Acquisition. In March 2024, we completed the conversion of
the acquired Co-op sites and EG UK Business sites to Asda Express. We look forward to exciting prospects in this
new market, including the expansion of the Asda Express convenience format to new locations.

Our values are rooted in service to our customers, respect for the individual, striving for excellence and acting
with integrity. We pursue our values with the support of our colleagues, culture and technology.

**The Transactions**

The Senior Facilities Agreement originally provided for (i) the Original Facility A, (ii) the Original Facility
B, (iii) the Original Revolving Facility and (iv) a further revolving credit facility in principal amount of £190,000,000
which was voluntarily cancelled by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in full on September 16, 2021.

In connection with the EG UK Acquisition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into an additional
revolving facility 1 in principal amount of £117,272,727 (the “Additional Revolving Facility 1”) and an additional
revolving facility 2 in principal amount of £50,000,000 (the “Additional Revolving Facility 2”, and together with
Additional Revolving Facility 1, the “Additional Revolving Facilities”), which increased the Original Revolving
Facility by a principal amount of £167,272,727. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer further entered into the Private
Placement Facility.

It is contemplated that on or around the Issue Date, (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue the Senior
Secured Notes offered hereby and (ii) the Senior Facilities Agreement will be amended and restated via an amendment
and restatement agreement to amend the terms thereof and constitute the Senior Facilities as at the Issue Date.

On or around the Issue Date, we will use the gross proceeds from the New Financing and cash on hand to
(i) partially repurchase the Existing Senior Secured Notes, (ii) prepay and cancel Original Facility B in full (the
“Facility B Refinancing”) and (iii) pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions. In addition,
New Facility A will also be utilised on or around the Issue Date and the proceeds of such utilisation will be applied
(directly or indirectly) in or towards financing part of the outstanding amounts under the Original Facility A, thereby
effecting a maturity extension of the commitments of consenting lenders (the “Facility A Maturity Extension”).
Likewise, the New Revolving Facility will also be established on or around the Issue Date and it is expected that the
commitments under the Original Revolving Facility will be cancelled, thereby effecting a maturity extension of the
commitments of consenting lenders (the “Revolving Facility Maturity Extension”).

In this Offering Memorandum, we refer to the following as the “Transactions”: (i) the New Financing and
the use of proceeds therefrom, including the making and consummation of the Richmond Tender Offer, (ii) the
establishment of New Facility A and New Revolving Facility and use of proceeds therefrom, (iii) the Facility A
Maturity Extension, the Revolving Facility Maturity Extension and the Facility B Refinancing, (iv) the payment of

Secured Notes in connection with the Richmond Tender Offer, prepay and cancel the Original Facility B in full and
pay the aggregate fees and expenses in respect of the Transactions, the holding of the New Financing Proceeds on
balance sheet (in cash or cash equivalents) and the application thereof to repay any Existing Senior Secured Notes
(other than the Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes) that were not subject to, or not tendered or accepted
in, the Richmond Tender Offer, as applicable, which is currently anticipated to be at the stated maturity in relation to
the Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes and at, or soon after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date in relation to

the Existing 4.50% Senior Secured Notes. The Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes, which were not
targeted under the Richmond Tender Offer, representing £500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing
3.25% Senior Secured Notes, will not be included in the repayment described in clause (v) above and therefore will
remain outstanding following the Transactions.

**Richmond Tender Offer**

Concurrently with the Offering, we have launched an offer to purchase for cash our outstanding Existing
Senior Secured Notes held pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act (the “Richmond Tender Offer”) up to
a certain maximum acceptance amount, expected to be set not to exceed (x) the sum of (i) the aggregate net proceeds

Pursuant to the terms of the Richmond Tender Offer, we will not accept any tenders with respect to Existing Senior
Secured Notes held pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured
Notes, representing £500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes, which
were not targeted in the Richmond Tender Offer, will remain outstanding following the Transactions.

The Richmond Tender Offer is being made upon terms and subject to the conditions set out in the separate
tender offer memorandum dated April 26, 2024 (the “Tender Offer Memorandum”). The Richmond Tender Offer
is conditioned upon the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation

The Offering is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Richmond Tender Offer. The maximum amount of
Existing Senior Secured Notes and the maximum amount of each series of Existing Senior Secured Notes accepted in
the Richmond Tender Offer will be determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in its sole and absolute discretion,
subject to the terms of the Richmond Tender Offer. This Offering Memorandum does not relate to the Richmond

**Recent Developments**

**_EG UK Acquisition_**

On October 31, 2023, Project America Bidco Ltd, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer,
completed its acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited, comprising the majority of EG Group’s UK business (the
“EG UK Business”). The EG UK Business is a fuel, grocery and foodservice retailer operating throughout the United
Kingdom and was acquired for an enterprise value £2.07 billion on a cash-free, debt-free basis. The final proceeds at
the point of acquisition were £2.1 billion (including transaction fees) and comprised:

    - £401 million of equity from the Group’s shareholders in the form of a subordinated shareholder loan;

    - the Private Placement Facility;

    - £646 million of proceeds from a sale and leaseback transaction of 24 stores completed in August 2023,
with a further store that completed in November 2023 (the “2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions”);

    - a bridge loan of £290 million (the “America Bridge Loan”); and

    - £88 million of cash on balance sheet.

The America Bridge Loan was refinanced and the cash on balance sheet was replenished via a ground rent
property transaction on 55 of Asda’s freehold and long leasehold property sites, which completed in December 2023
with proceeds of £400 million (the “2023 **Ground Rent Transaction”). The remaining proceeds from the 2023**
Ground Rent Transaction were retained as cash on balance sheet, in part repaying cash utilised to fund the EG UK
Acquisition and to settle transaction fees. For more detail on the Private Placement Facility, the 2023 Sale and
Leaseback Facility and the Ground Rent Transaction, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**_Strategic Discussions Regarding Shareholder Changes_**

The shareholders are involved in active discussions regarding Zuber Issa ceasing to continue as a shareholder
of the Group in which he holds his participation through his 50% ownership in Able Holdings Limited and consequent
withdrawal from his directorships in the Asda business. Upon the completion of a transaction whereby Zuber Issa
would no longer be a shareholder of the Group, it is expected that he would resign from his directorships in all Bellis
and Asda entities. The discussions remain ongoing and there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will
ultimately be entered into or that any such transaction will take place.

**_Current Trading_**

_The unaudited preliminary financial results presented below are derived from the Group’s unaudited_
_management accounts. This information has not been audited or reviewed, nor have any procedures been performed_

19


-----

_by the Group’s independent auditors with respect thereto, and it has not been prepared with a view towards_
_compliance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance_
_on it, and no opinion or any other form of assurance is provided with respect thereto. The Group’s unaudited_
_preliminary financial results are based upon a number of assumptions and judgments that are subject to inherent_
_uncertainties and are subject to change, and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the Group’s financial_
_or operational results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024. Although the Group believes the management_
_estimates and unaudited preliminary financial information and the assumptions on which they are based to be_
_reasonable, the Group’s actual results as of and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 to be published in_
_the coming months may vary from the information contained below and such variations could be material._

Based on preliminary management accounts, we estimate that our revenue (excluding fuel) for the threemonth period ended March 31, 2024 was £5,305 million (of which we estimate £5,109 million was attributable to the
standalone Asda business (excluding acquisitions), £65 million was attributable to sales from the Arthur Business and
£131 million was attributable to sales from the EG UK Business), an increase of £210 million, or 4%, compared to
£5,095 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 (of which £5,012 million was attributable to the
standalone Asda business (excluding acquisitions) and £83 million was attributable to sales from the Arthur Business,
which were not consolidated into the Group results until May 30, 2023 when the CMA lifted its Initial Enforcement
Order in connection with the Arthur Acquisition). Asda standalone sales excluding fuel have increased by 1.9% yearover-year, with like-for-like growth of 0.5%. This overall increase was driven in part by investments made into our
proposition, including as a result of the Aldi and Lidl Price Match programme, Fab 5 and mega deals driving
improvements in price perception. We also benefited from non-food sales, which grew faster than the Asda group as
a whole and faster than the market. The grocery market continues to be very competitive and overall our sales growth,
excluding fuel, was slower than the market in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, partly reflecting slower
than market growth in our inflation.

For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, we estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA was £254 million,
an increase of £48 million, or 23%, from £206 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. For the three
month-period ended March 31, 2024, we estimate that £7 million of Adjusted EBITDA was attributable to the Arthur
Business, £35 million of Adjusted EBITDA was attributable to the EG UK Business and £ (17) million was attributable
to the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and 2023 Ground Rent Transaction. For the three-month period ended
March 31, 2023, £16 million of Adjusted EBITDA was attributable to the Arthur Business. This overall increase was
supported by improved year-over-year trading margins and disciplined cost control, with Adjusted EBITDA margins
(excluding fuel) increasing by 0.70 percentage points year-over-year to 4.8% in the three-month period ended March
31, 2024, from 4.1% in the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. Fuel margins were slightly lower in the period
in the standalone Asda business, as well as in the EG UK Business and the Arthur Business, as cost prices rose
significantly while retail prices did not increase as quickly.

We believe this overall growth in the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA is mainly driven by recovering gross
margin, including a strong performance in our clothing line and our ability to control costs, which highlights the
resilience of our business model. We believe in continued investment in price, particularly as inflation softens, which
could boost consumers discretionary spending. We expect utility costs to begin to decline year-on-year from April
2024. We continue to integrate the EG UK Business and the Arthur Business and expect to crystallise synergies.

We closed the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, with cash balance of approximately £1 billion with
a strong underlying Cash Conversion. Our Adjusted Net Cash Flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus capex
(excluding Project Future capex) plus/minus change in net working capital minus Project Future costs (including
Future capex) minus net financing costs plus proceeds from disposals minus other and debt repayment plus cashflows
Arthur Acquisition and EG UK Acquisition) was negative £32 million in the three-month period ended March 31,
2024 as compared to negative £157 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. Ongoing positive
momentum on the net working capital with improving payment terms, particularly on fuel and on inventory
management further helped improve our cash generation.

_Notes.”_

(5) The Senior Facilities Agreement, after giving effect to the Transactions provides for committed facilities of up to £1,750 million (equivalent),
which comprises up to £73,725,000 Original Facility A (to the extent not repaid in full, with a minimum amount of £9,775,000 of commitments
under Original Facility A expected to remain outstanding on or around the Issue Date), a minimum of £92,250,000 New Facility A (with a
possible additional commitment of £63,725,000 under Original Facility A which could be extended under New Facility A on or shortly after
the Issue Date), the €1,050,000,000 Facility B (EUR) and the £683,903,176 Private Placement Facility, as well as at least £747,722,727 New
Revolving Facility (with a possible incremental commitment of £45,000,000 under the New Revolving Facility which could be made available
on or shortly after the Issue Date). The borrowers under the Senior Facilities Agreement are the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and (in respect
of the New Revolving Facility only) Asda Stores Limited and the Senior Facilities are guaranteed by the Guarantors. New Facility A will be
utilised on or around the Issue Date and the proceeds of such utilisation will be applied (directly or indirectly) in or towards financing part of
the outstanding amounts under the Original Facility A on a cashless basis. Facility B (EUR) will be utilised by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer towards financing any the outstanding amounts under the Original Facility B or repurchasing or redeeming the Existing Senior Secured
Notes. Subject to certain limitations, other subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, may become borrowers under the Senior Facilities
Agreement in the future. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement” and “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.” Subject to compliance with the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior_
Secured Notes Indenture, the New Senior Secured Notes Indentures and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the commitments made available
under the Senior Facilities Agreement may be increased in the future. The New Revolving Facility is expected to remain undrawn on the Issue
Date.

(6) Represents the £1,750 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes. On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be
general senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, will be guaranteed on a senior
basis by the Guarantors and will be secured by the Initial Collateral as set forth under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.”
Within 30 days, the Senior Secured Notes will also be secured by the Post-Closing Non-Real Estate Collateral. Within 180 days, the Senior
Secured Notes will also be secured by the Post-Closing Real Estate Collateral. The Guarantors also guarantee the obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Existing Senior Secured Notes on a pari passu and equal and ratable basis with the Senior Secured Notes (and
on a senior basis to the Existing Senior Notes). The Shared Security also secures the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations under the Existing
Senior Notes on a second-priority basis. Additionally, the Collateral (including the Shared Security) secures the obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Existing Senior Secured Notes on an equal and ratable basis with the Senior Secured Notes (and, with respect
to the Shared Security, on a senior basis to the Existing Senior Notes). The Collateral (including the Shared Security) may also secure certain
hedging obligations and (in the event that the Term Loan Facilities (as defined herein) are repaid in full) certain other indebtedness permitted
to be incurred and secured on the Collateral on a super senior basis. In the event of an enforcement of the Collateral, the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes will receive proceeds from such Collateral only after the holders of any hedging obligations and other indebtedness that is
permitted to be secured on a super priority basis have been repaid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement.” As of December 31, 2023, based on Asda’s allocation of properties for accounting purposes (which has not been verified by an_
assessment of the registered proprietor of each of the properties) and subject to matters disclosed in the section of this Offering Memorandum
entitled “Valuation Report,” the Guarantors hold sites representing over 99% of the value of the Market Value SA Properties (consisting of
Asda supermarkets (excluding supermarkets pledged in connection with the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction), Food to Go sites, industrial
properties and office properties), 90% of the value of the Market Value Properties (consisting of PFSs, investment properties, development
and landbank sites and a Distribution Centre – Held for Sale site) and 0% of the properties leased in connection with the 2023 Ground Rent
Transaction. Asda believes such percentage allocation would not materially vary based on verification of the registered proprietor of each of
the properties. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Guarantors represented 98% of the Group’s consolidated revenue. Each Notes
Guarantee will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including the Agreed Security Principles, and certain contractual and
legal limitations. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations
_and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” By virtue of these limitations, a_
Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes,
or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. The gross proceeds from the Offering are expected to be £1,750
million, which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer intends to use, together with the borrowings under Facility B (EUR) and cash on hand to
(i) partially repurchase the Existing Senior Secured Notes, (ii) prepay and cancel Original Facility B in full and (iii) pay fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds.”

_the Senior Secured Notes—Release of Liens.”_

**Use of Proceeds .......................................................** The gross proceeds from the Offering, are expected to be
£1,750 million, which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
intends to use, together with the borrowings under Facility B
(EUR) and cash on hand to (i) partially repurchase the
Existing Senior Secured Notes, (ii) prepay and cancel
Original Facility B in full and (iii) pay fees and expenses
incurred in connection with the Transactions, as set out in
“Use of Proceeds.”

**Optional Redemption .............................................** Prior to     , 2026, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the
Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of
the principal amount thereof, plus a “make-whole” premium.

Prior to     , 2026, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may
also redeem, during each 12-month period commencing with
the Issue Date, up to 10% of the aggregate outstanding
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including
Additional Senior Secured Notes, if any) at a redemption
price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof.

In addition, prior to     , 2026, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer may redeem at its option up to 40% of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
(including Additional Senior Secured Notes, if any) with the
net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings.

At any time on or after     , 2026, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior Secured
Notes at the following redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of principal amount) during the 12-month period
beginning on        of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**
2026 ............................................................... %
2027 ............................................................... %
2028, and thereafter ....................................... 100.000%

**Tender offers ..........................................................** In connection with certain tender offers for the Senior

repurchase the Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of
certain events constituting a change of control, if holders of
not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes validly tender and do not
withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in the tender offer and
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any third party making
such a tender offer in lieu of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes validly tendered
and not withdrawn by such holders, all of the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes will be deemed to have consented to
such tender or other offer and, accordingly, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right to
redeem the Senior Secured Notes that remain outstanding in
whole, but not in part, following such purchase at a price
equal to the price offered to each other holder of Senior
Secured Notes.

27


-----

**Additional Amounts ...............................................** All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Guarantor in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes or any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be
made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction
for, or on account of, any taxes, except to the extent required
by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of,
any taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined herein) is required by law to
be made from any payments under the Senior Secured Notes
or the Notes Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
the Guarantors will, subject to certain exceptions, pay
additional amounts so that the net amount received by each
holder in respect of such payments after such withholding or
deduction (including any deduction or withholding from such
additional amounts) is not less than the amounts which would
have been received by such holder in the absence of such
withholding or deduction. See “Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes.”_

**Tax redemption ......................................................** If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction become effective that would impose withholding
taxes or other deductions on the payments on the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Guarantor is required to pay additional amounts, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer may redeem the Senior Secured Notes
in whole, but not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed
for redemption and all additional amounts, if any. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Redemption for
_Taxation Reasons.”_

**Change of Control ..................................................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change
of control the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required to
make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Senior Secured
Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof.

**Certain Covenants ..................................................** The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will, among other
things, restrict the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and its restricted subsidiaries, to:

                            - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and
issue certain preferred stock;

                            - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make
certain investments;

                            - make certain other restricted payments;

                            - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                            - impose restrictions on the ability of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries to pay
dividends;

                            - transfer or sell certain assets;

28


-----

                            - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                            - enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

                            - impair the security interests created for the
benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes; and

                            - consummate certain Sale and Leaseback
Transactions, Ground Rent Transactions or
Qualified Securitisation Financings (in each
case, as defined under “Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain Definitions.”_
Certain of the covenants will be suspended if the Senior
Secured Notes obtain and maintain an investment-grade
rating.

Each of the covenants in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
will be subject to significant exceptions and qualifications.
See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants.”_

**Transfer Restrictions .............................................** The Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not
been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act or
the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Senior
Secured Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability
and resale. See “Notice to Investors.” The Group has not
agreed to, or otherwise undertaken to, register the Senior
Secured Notes under the securities laws in any jurisdiction
(including by way of an exchange offer).

**Original Issue Discount ..........................................** The Senior Secured Notes may be issued with original issue
discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In
such event, U.S. holders (as defined under “Certain Tax
_Considerations—Certain United States Federal Income Tax_
_Considerations”) of the Senior Secured Notes generally will_
be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary
income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual
method regardless of their regular method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, such
U.S. holders generally will include any OID in income in
advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.
See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United States
_Federal Income Tax Considerations—Original Issue_
_Discount.”_

**No Established Market for the Senior Secured** The Senior Secured Notes will be new securities for which
**Notes ........................................................................** there is currently no established trading market. Accordingly,
there is no assurance that an active trading market will
develop for the Senior Secured Notes.

**Listing ......................................................................** Application will be made to The International Stock
Exchange Authority Limited to list the Senior Secured Notes
on the Official List of the Exchange and to admit the Senior
Secured Notes for trading on the Exchange.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL**
**INFORMATION AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA**

_The historical consolidated financial information and other financial data of the Group as of and for the_
_years ended December 31, 2021, 2022 and 2023 have been extracted from the audited consolidated financial_
_statements of the Group included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum or from the Group’s accounting records._

_We also present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited financial information adjusted to give pro_
_forma effect to the Transactions (“As Adjusted Financial Information”). See “—Other Financial Data—Other_
_Financial Indicators” and “Capitalisation.” The As Adjusted Financial Information included in this Offering_
_Memorandum has not been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the Securities Act or_
_any generally accepted accounting standards. The assumptions underlying the As Adjusted Financial Information_
_have not been audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted accounting standards. Any reliance_
_you place on this information should fully take this into consideration. The As Adjusted Financial Information has_
_been provided for informational purposes only. Results indicated by certain of these measures may not be realised,_
_and funds depicted by certain of these measures may not be available for management’s discretionary use if such_
_results are not realised. Further, the As Adjusted Financial Information does not purport to indicate our future_
_consolidated results of operations or our cash position or financial position as at any future date. The actual results_
_may differ significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information for a number of reasons,_
_including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the As Adjusted Financial Information._

_Results of operations for prior periods or years are not necessarily indicative of the result to be expected for_
_any future period. Prospective investors should bear in mind that the performance indicators and ratios that we report_
_herein, such as the EBITDA Measures, Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, movement in working capital, Underlying_
_Cash Flow From Operations, capital expenditure, Capital Expenditure KPI and certain other measures are not_
_financial measures defined in accordance with UK IFRS and, as such, may be calculated by other companies using_
_different methodologies and having different results. Therefore, these performance indicators and ratios are not_
_directly comparable to similar figures and ratios reported by other companies. The following tables also contain_
_financial measures and ratios that are not presented in accordance with UK IFRS. For the definitions and analytical_
_limitations of these Non-IFRS Measures, see “Presentation of Financial and Other Information.” You should read_
_the information summarised below in conjunction with the information contained in “Presentation of Financial and_
_Other Information,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results_
_of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering_

**Other Financial Data**

In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of alternative performance measures and
financial measures. Such indicators are either purely operational in nature, include financial information not derived
from our accounting system and may include VAT which is collected by us at the cash registers or online checkout
but turned over to the competent tax authorities. For certain 2021 financial information, we present an annualised
figure. The actual financial results of the Group do not include a full year of trading in the year ended December 31,
2021, as the Senior Notes Issuer acquired the trading group Asda Group Limited part way through the year on February
16, 2021. As a result, actual results for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the Senior Notes Issuer consolidated
group do not constitute a full comparative period. Therefore, to provide a more meaningful comparison, the results
for the year ended December 31, 2021 are presented on an annualised basis as if Asda Group Limited had been
acquired by the Senior Notes Issuer on January 1, 2021.

(1) Refers to total sales (excluding VAT) excluding fuel.

(2) Certain amounts have been presented in the consolidated income statement as non-underlying by virtue of their size and nature. In 2021,
non-underlying items relate to transaction costs relating to LBO Acquisition, Project Future costs, gain on bargain purchase and a
sale-and-leaseback gain. In 2022, non-underlying items relate to Project Future costs, reimbursed settlement relating to historical tax reliefs,
transaction costs relating to LBO Acquisition and impairment of tangible assets and right of use assets relating to leases. In 2023,
non-underlying items relate to transaction costs relating to the acquisition of EG UK, Project Future costs and net reversal of impairments
relating to tangible assets and right of use assets relating to leases. For more detail on these non-underlying items, see “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as_
_compared to the year ended December 31, 2022,” “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of_
_Operations—Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021” and Note 5 to_
the 2023 Financial Statements.

(3) Like-for-like sales growth is a measure of annual growth of sales calculated as current year comparable sales excluding fuel (excluding VAT)
versus prior year comparable sales. Current year comparable sales includes all revenue except fuel sales, sales generated from stores in the
first twelve complete calendar months following opening, sales generated from stores that have permanently closed, sales generated from
stores that have been temporarily closed for more than two consecutive calendar months within the previous twelve full calendar months,
financial services commissions, ‘toyou.’ Sales are net of Asda Rewards earned and other discounts.

(4) Based upon the Kantar Worldpanel (Take Home Panel –Till Roll – Spend as of the 12 weeks ended January 21, 2024) grocery market share
for the 12 weeks ended December 26, 2021, December 25, 2022 and December 24, 2023, respectively.

(5) Calculated as the total number of individual transactions in-store during the year (excludes transactions at stores from the EG UK Acquisition
and Arthur Acquisition).

(6) Represents the proportion of food sales initiated by customers digitally (including all online grocery and click and collect sales and transactions
initiated from a computer or mobile device) but specifically excluding brick-and-mortar sales executed by customers using mobile payment
or scan and go (excludes fuel sales and sales at stores from the EG UK Acquisition and Arthur Acquisition).

(7) Represents the number of customers using Asda Rewards in the last 30 days, based upon a rolling four-week average, as at December 31,
2022 and 2023. Asda Rewards was launched in 2022 so there is no comparative value for 2021 (excludes customers at stores from the EG
UK Acquisition and Arthur Acquisition).

calculation and presentation of the EBITDA Measures in this Offering Memorandum is similar to, but different from, the calculation of
Consolidated EBITDA under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes
Indenture or the Senior Facilities Agreement. Accordingly, the EBITDA Measures do not provide precise indications as to the level of our

(A) The asset write-off adjustment relates to the non-cash write off of all tangible fixed assets with value written off in the normal course of
business, usually as a result of store or depot remodelling activities.

36


-----

(B) The elimination of IFRS 16 impact adjustment deducts from EBITDA rental payments made during the period and accounts for all
leases as if they were classified as operating leases under IAS 17 prior to the entry into force of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019.

(C) Prior year ATM rates adjustment reflects the removal of income that has been included in EBITDA following a change in the assessment
of business rates for automated teller machines (“ATMs”).

(D) The restructuring adjustments comprise one off provisions relating to (i) facilities management restructuring, in-store bakery proposition
restructuring, management and back office restructure and closure of Heston & Dartford depots totalling £30.6 million in 2021, (ii)
facilities management restructuring and retail admin colleague restructuring totalling £4.7 million in 2022 and (iii) Night-to-twilight
shift re-organisation, head office colleague restructure, livings and post office closures totalling £17.4 million in 2023.

(E) Tax saving pass through adjustment reflects the pass through to Walmart of tax deductions relating to adjustments to the carrying value
of the loan from Asda Stores Limited to the ASDA Group Pension Scheme which was part of the financing of the ASDA Group Pension
Scheme buy-in. These tax deductions were passed through to Walmart under the terms of the LBO Transaction.

(F) The legal settlement in 2023 relates to a net credit received as a result of settling historical legal cases. This credit recognized is net of
amounts which were passed through to Walmart under the terms of the original LBO Acquisition.

(G) The Group acquired Arthur Foodstores Ltd, a carve-out of 132 convenience sites from the Co-operative Group as part of the Arthur
Acquisition, in October 2022. The Arthur Acquisition was subject to an Initial Enforcement Order by the CMA and it therefore was
deemed that the Group did not have control according to the principles defined in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements in order
to consolidate the results into the Group in the year ended December 31, 2022. With respect to the year ended December 31, 2022, the
Group includes actual Adjusted EBITDA related to the trading performance of the Arthur Business since the closing of the transaction
on October 30, 2022 as if the trading performance of the Arthur Business had been consolidated from October 30, 2022 in Adjusted
EBITDA without giving effect to any annualization. With respect to the year ended December 31, 2023, results for the Arthur
Acquisition have been included in the Group’s consolidated results from May 30, 2023 when the Initial Enforcement Order was lifted
by the CMA. An adjustment has been made to Adjusted EBITDA for the year-ended December 31, 2023 to give effect to Adjusted
EBITDA of the Arthur Business from January 1, 2023 through May 30, 2023 as if the trading performance of the Arthur Business had
been consolidated from January 1, 2023. No further adjustment has been made to reflect the annualisation of the impact of 13 sites that
were disposed in December 2023 and January 2024, as required as remedies to the CMA’s investigation into the Arthur Acquisition;
see below adjustment (T) in relation to the year ended December 31, 2023.

(H) Prior to the LBO Acquisition, ASDA Stores Limited provided retirement benefits for eligible employees through two defined benefit
plans in the UK, including one funded, the ASDA Group Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”). On July 9, 2021, the trustees of the Scheme
completed a full buy-out of the Scheme. To the extent that the Scheme was unable to make repayments of principal amounts outstanding
on the buy-in loan out of Scheme assets, ASDA Stores Limited was obliged to make a contribution to the Scheme to the value of the
shortfall. The pension buyout loss reflects the difference between the net carrying amount of Scheme assets and liabilities and the
recoverable amount of the buy-in loan at the date of buyout, after accounting for a net actuarial loss of £13.9 million. For more details
see note 20 to the 2021 Financial Statements.

(I) The ARO provision release adjustment removes the accounting gain recorded in EBITDA relating to the release of an asset retirement
provision as a result of remeasuring the asset retirement obligation liability due to changes in the discount rate.

(J) At completion of the Arthur Acquisition in October 2022, Asda entered into an Outsourcing and Interim Franchise Agreement (“OIFA”)
with Co-op. Under the terms of the OIFA, Co-op provided outsourced management services for the Arthur Business sites. These services
included providing the workforce to operate the sites, area management teams, the supply and fulfilment of grocery inventory and IT
services. These services were provided during the period of the CMA review and up until the stores were handover to Asda management
and re-branded as Asda Express. Under the terms of the OIFA, Arthur paid a management fee to Co-op based on a percentage of revenue.
Other advisor and integration fees adjustment relate to the non-recurring payments made under the OIFA arrangements, non-recurring
third-party advisor fees to support the independent management team and other non-recurring third-party advisor fees incurred by the
Group.

(K) In 2021, the one-off acquisition costs incurred relating to the LBO Acquisition relate to third party advisor fees and stamp duty paid in
relation to the acquisition in the prior period of the entire issued share capital of Asda Group Limited. In 2022, the one-off acquisition
costs incurred relating to the Arthur Acquisition relate to third party advisor fees in relation to the acquisition in the prior period of the
entire issued share capital of Arthur Foodstores Limited. In 2023, the one-off acquisition costs incurred relating to the EG UK
Acquisition relate to third party advisor fees in relation to the acquisition in the prior period of the entire issued share capital of Euro
Garages (Jersey) Limited.

(L) The one-off separation costs adjustment removes the incremental costs incurred to support the separation from Walmart. These costs
include IT related and non-IT related costs. Since the LBO Acquisition, the Group has embarked on a programme, Project Future, to
separate its IT systems from its previous owner Walmart. The separation programme is one-off and non-recurring in nature, and will
transition the Group to a standalone IT infrastructure using software as a service from digital partners.

(M) All share-based payment liabilities issued prior to the LBO Acquisition were settled during the year ended December 31, 2021. The
share option programmes allowed Group employees to acquire shares of the former ultimate parent company of Asda Group Limited –
Walmart Inc. These awards were granted by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The fair value of options granted was initially
measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees became unconditionally entitled to payment. The charge
was recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value of the share options was measured
based on an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The liability
was re-measured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value were recognised in the consolidated
income statement during the vesting period. These share-based payment transactions were accounted for as cash-settled.

37


-----

(N) Options in Walmart shares have historically been awarded to employees of the Group; these share option awards were accounted for
within EBITDA as cash settled equity awards. Share award schemes were all existing options in Walmart shares and were settled in
2021, the corresponding charges have since fallen away and, as a result, are added back for the year ended December 31, 2021 (£17.5
million). Since then, the Group has, however, enhanced other colleague incentive programmes. The estimated annual incremental cost
of these enhanced incentive programmes was estimated to be £16 million in 2021. Therefore, a charge of £16.0 million has been included
for year ended December 31 2021. In subsequent periods, this incremental investment in colleague incentive programmes is considered
to be an underlying cost of the business and therefore, no adjustments are made in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023.

(O) The ground rent charge relates to payments in connection with servicing the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction.

(P) The Starbucks rental income adjustment reflects the recognition of rental income from the Starbucks freehold properties acquired as
part of the EG UK Acquisition. This adjustment represents rental income for two months since closing of the transaction recognized on
a straight-line basis.

(Q) In connection with the EG UK Acquisition, the Group entered into a number of arrangements with EG Finco Limited, including the
TSA and an integration support arrangement. These arrangements were all negotiated concurrently with the acquisition of Euro Garages
(Jersey) Limited, they are interdependent with the terms of the acquisition, and were negotiated as a single transaction. Under the TSA,
a subsidiary of EG Finco Limited will provide Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited and its subsidiaries with IT and other centralized services
for an initial term of two years. During this initial term, these services are provided at £nil cost to the Group, subject to certain limited
exceptions. In addition, EG Finco Limited has also agreed for a period of two years to reimburse the Group for certain centralized costs
which transferred as part of the transaction perimeter and are required to support the acquired business. This arrangement is not
considered to be part of the business combination under IFRS 3R and therefore, £27.3 million of the consideration transferred to EG
Finco Limited has been allocated to the TSA arrangement based on the fair value of the services provided subsidiaries of EG Finco
Limited and the estimated costs to be recharged by the Group to EG Finco Limited. This has been recognised within prepayments and
will be recognized within operating expenses in the consolidated income statement over the initial two-year term of the TSA. The TSA
prepayment unwind adjustment reflects an adjustment for the amortization of the prepayment recognized in EBITDA since closing of
the transaction.

(R) Under the integration support arrangement, the Group and EG Finco Limited entered into an agreement whereby EG Finco Limited
would support the costs associated with the integration of the acquisition by the Group for a fixed amount of £11.3 million over two
years with the payments made quarterly. The full amount has been recorded as an adjustment to the purchase consideration and
recognized within Other Debtors at closing in the consolidated balance sheet. The integration payment reflects the recording of this
payment within EBITDA on a straight-line basis.

(S) In 2022, management shares in the immediate parent company of the Group, Bellis Midco 4 Limited, were issued to eligible members
of senior management employed by the Group as part of a Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) in exchange for proceeds determined
by an independent calculation of fair value at the issue date. The MIP add-back reflects adjustment to add back the related share-based
payment charge under IFRS 2 for the year ended December 31, 2023.

(T) The adjustment for the Arthur Acquisition impact of CMA disposals relates to the annualisation of the impact of 13 sites that were
disposed in December 2023 and January 2024, as required as remedies to the CMA’s investigation into the Arthur Acquisition.

(U) Represents the targeted synergies from the Arthur Acquisition that are expected to be delivered within two years of completion. These
synergies are related to the anticipated benefits of increased volume and margin benefits which we believe we can achieve through our
value leadership, scale, supplier relationships and operational efficiencies.

(V) Represents the adjustment to annualise LTM EBITDA for the acquisition of America. The EG UK Acquisition closed on October 31,
2023 and the results of the EG UK Business were consolidated into our results from that date. This adjustment reflects £164 million of
EBITDA attributed to the EG UK Business from January 1, 2023 to October 31, 2023, which represents the actual performance of the
acquired perimeter for that period.

(W) Represents the targeted synergies resulting for the EG UK Acquisition expected to be delivered within two years of completion A large
portion of the synergies are expected to flow into gross profit as sales grow and buying benefits materialise. These synergies are
comprised of (i) £44 million related to fuel, £24 million related to grocery and merchandise and £1 million related to foodservice. We
expect the Fuel synergies to stem from price investments and an uplift in EG volumes, fuel cost price reductions, fuel card commercial
terms improvements, joint buying benefits and merchant cost savings. We expect grocery and retail synergies to come from price
investments and an uplift in EG volumes, range optimisations, in-store marketing income, other monetisation of customer data, best cost
price switching and buying benefits. We expect foodservice synergies to come from an enhanced foodservice proposition, our in-store
foodservice outlets at our grocery sites and the introduction of new foodservice sites leveraging our vacant tenancy portfolio. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—We may from time to time pursue_
_acquisitions, which may prove more costly than anticipated and may not generate anticipated synergies and which may have an adverse_
_impact on our business, as could our failure to successfully integrate such businesses following acquisition. Our business could also be_
_negatively impacted by merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by supranational and national laws and regulations.”_

(X) Sale and leaseback rent store assets annualisation adjustments relate to the annualisation of rent costs and servicing costs associated with
the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions as if the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions had completed on January 1, 2023.

(Y) Ground rent annualisation adjustments relate to the annualisation of rent costs and servicing costs associated with the 2023 Ground Rent
Transaction as if the Ground Rent Transaction Facility Agreement was in place on January 1, 2023.

(4) Free Cash Flow is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditure KPI. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash
Flow to Adjusted EBITDA.

**For the year ended December 31,**

**2021** **2022** **2023**

**(annualised)**
_(£ millions, unless indicated otherwise)_

**Adjusted EBITDA ............................................................................................................** **1,151** **867** **1,078**
Capital Expenditure KPI ..................................................................................................... 420 277 302
**Free Cash Flow..................................................................................................................** **731** **590** **776**

(5) Cash Conversion is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

(6) Capital Expenditure KPI is defined as the total costs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of which the Group takes ownership
within a financial period (as opposed to the IFRS measurement of capital expenditure which is based on cash flows). It excludes capital
expenditure on Project Future, investment required by Asda to separate from Walmart’s IT systems. The table below presents our capital
expenditure for the periods indicated and includes a reconciliation from Capital Expenditure KPI to capital expenditure as disclosed in the
consolidated statement of cash flows.

**For the year ended December 31,**

**2021** **2022** **2023**

**(annualised)**
_(£ millions, unless indicated otherwise)_

Purchase of property, plant and equipment .............................................................. 328 251 280
Purchase of intangible assets .............................................................................................. 109 69 57
**Capital expenditure ..........................................................................................................** **437** **320** **337**
Project Future capital expenditure ......................................................................................    - (49) (34)
Timing differences[(A)] .......................................................................................................... (17) 6     **Capital Expenditure KPI .................................................................................................** **420** **277** **302**

(A) Capital expenditure is a measure of assets received by the Group within the financial period whereas the purchase of property, plant
and equipment and the purchase of intangible assets is a measure of cash outflow relating to the purchase of assets. The primary reason
for the difference in capital expenditure and Capital Expenditure KPI is due to the timing of when the assets are paid for. There are
timing differences between the two measures due to internal capital expenditure being presented on an accrual basis.

(7) Underlying Cash Flow From Operations is Free Cash Flow plus Movement in Net Working Capital. The following table sets forth a
reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to Underlying Cash Flow From Operations.

**For the year ended December 31,**

**2021** **2022** **2023**

**(annualised)** **(restated)**
_(£ millions, unless indicated otherwise)_

**Free Cash Flow..................................................................................................................** **731** **591** **776**
Movement in Net Working Capital[(A)] ................................................................................. (1) 259 183
**Underlying Cash Flow From Operations .............................................................** **730** **850** **959**

(A) Movement in Net Working Capital for the year ended December 31, 2022 and year ended December 31, 2023 represents the sum of the
movements in trade and other receivables, inventories, trade and other payables, and provisions as disclosed in the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows. Movement in Net Working Capital for the year ended December 31, 2021 represents the sum of the movements
in trade and other receivables, inventories, trade and other payables, and provisions as disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows and which have been annualised as if the Senior Notes Issuer had consolidated Asda Group Limited and its subsidiaries from
January 1, 2021.The Movement in Net Working Capital for the year ended December 31, 2021 has been further adjusted to remove the
impact of business rates of £251 million accrued by Asda Group Limited at December 31, 2020 and paid in the year ended December
31, 2021. The Movement in Net Working Capital for the year ended December 31, 2023 has been further adjusted to remove the impact
of one-off acquisition costs of £40.1 million accrued at December 31, 2023 relating to the EG UK Acquisition.

(8) _Pro forma net debt consists of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s pro forma indebtedness in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, the Remaining_
Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities and the guarantees relating to the Existing Senior Notes, net of the Group’s cash
and cash equivalents as at December 31, 2023, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions on the Issue
Date. See “Capitalisation.” Pro forma net debt assumes that 100% of holders of targeted Existing Senior Secured Notes tender in the
Richmond Tender Offer. The Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes, representing £500 million in aggregate principal amount of
the Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes, which were not targeted in the Richmond Tender Offer, will remain outstanding following the
Transactions. To the extent that fewer eligible holders participate in the Richmond Tender Offer (or such Existing Senior Secured Notes are
not accepted by us), pro forma net debt is not expected to change because we intend to hold the New Financing Proceeds (in cash or cash
equivalents) on balance sheet until applied to repay such Existing Senior Secured Notes (other than the Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior

Secured Notes) that were not subject to, or not tendered or accepted in, the Richmond Tender Offer, which is currently anticipated to be at
the stated maturity in relation to the Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes and at, or soon after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date in
relation to the Existing 4.50% Senior Secured Notes. Our presentation and calculation of the ratio of Pro forma net debt to Pro forma Adjusted
EBITDA may be different from the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing
Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement and is not indicative of our level of adherence to the terms of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Facilities Agreement. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” and
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

(9) _Pro forma net senior secured debt consists of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s pro forma indebtedness in respect of the Senior Secured_
Notes, the Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes, and the Senior Facilities, net of the Group’s cash and cash equivalents as at
December 31, 2023, as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions on the Issue Date. See “Capitalisation.”
Pro forma net senior secured debt assumes that 100% of holders of targeted Existing Senior Secured Notes tender in the Richmond Tender
Offer. The Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes, representing £500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing 3.25%
Senior Secured Notes, which were not targeted in the Richmond Tender Offer, will remain outstanding following the Transactions. To the
extent that fewer eligible holders participate in the Richmond Tender Offer (or such Existing Senior Secured Notes are not accepted by us),
pro forma net senior secured debt is not expected to change because we intend to hold the New Financing Proceeds (in cash or cash
equivalents) on balance sheet until applied to repay such Existing Senior Secured Notes (other than the Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior
Secured Notes) that were not subject to, or not tendered or accepted in, the Richmond Tender Offer, which is currently anticipated to be at
the stated maturity in relation to the Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes and at, or soon after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date in
relation to the Existing 4.50% Senior Secured Notes. Our presentation and calculation of the ratio of Pro forma net senior secured debt to Pro
_forma Adjusted EBITDA may be different from the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio under the Senior Secured_
Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement and
is not indicative of our level of adherence to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures,
the Existing Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Facilities Agreement. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” and “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements.”_

(10) _Pro forma interest expense represents the interest expense on our pro forma net debt after giving pro forma effect to the consummation of the_
Transactions on the Issue Date. Pro forma interest expense (i) excludes charges related to allocated debt issuance costs; (ii) excludes finance
costs associated with leases (including, for the avoidance of doubt, leases in connection with the 2021 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and
the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions), (iii) excludes finance costs associated with liabilities relating to the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction
and (iv) includes interest expense associated with the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, the Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured
Notes, the Existing Senior Notes and the Senior Facilities. Pro forma interest expense has been presented for illustrative purposes only and
does not purport to describe what our interest expense would have actually been had the above-mentioned transactions occurred at the
beginning of the year ended December 31, 2023, nor does it purport to project our interest expense for any future period or our financial
condition at any future date.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Senior Secured Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information_
_contained in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing_
_the Senior Secured Notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Group faces._
_Additional risks and uncertainties of which the Group is not aware or that it currently believes are immaterial may_
_also adversely affect the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If any of the_
_possible events described below were to occur, the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and_
_prospects could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may not be_
_able to pay interest or principal on the Senior Secured Notes, respectively, when due, and you could lose all or part_
_of your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties._
_The Group’s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a_
_result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. See_
_“Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**_Risks Relating to Our General Operations_**

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry and our business, financial condition and results operations, as well_**
**_as the strength of our brand, may be materially adversely affected by actions of our competitors and our failure to_**
**_respond to competitive pressures._**

In the highly competitive grocery retail industry, success depends on satisfying changing customer needs
more effectively than the competition. Failure to meet consumer demands is a competitive disadvantage and we may
therefore be exposed to a loss of market share. There can be no assurance that we can continue to successfully compete
with existing competitors or new market entrants. Our competition generally includes international and domestic
brick-and-mortar retailers (including, generalist grocers, supermarket chains, discount retailers, grocery specialists
and convenience stores), some of which also operate omni-channel businesses such as Amazon, as well as online pure
players, such as Ocado. In recent years, the historically stable grocery retail market in the United Kingdom has
undergone a structural shift towards discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl, convenience formats and online retailers, to
the detriment of traditional supermarkets and hypermarkets. We generally compete for, among other things, customers,
market share, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of the business
with many other local, regional, national and global omni-channel retailers, wholesale operators and retail
intermediaries. Our competitors generally compete with us on the basis of, among other things, price, quality,
selection, availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, shopping convenience,
brand reputation, overall shopping experience, attractiveness and ease of use of our online platforms, cost and delivery
speed of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical
and digital operations.

In executing our strategy, we may face a variety of competitive challenges, including, among others:

    - potential emergence of new competitors, including foreign and domestic retailers entering our markets,
or consolidation, strengthening or expanded offerings of existing operators, as has been the case in recent
years with the emergence of discounters (for more information, see “Industry” and “Business—Key
_Strengths”);_

    - potential creation by competitors of new store formats, additional convenience grocery retail store
offerings, in-store or online services, delivery and pick-up options, loyalty and reward schemes or online
platforms that customers may prefer;

    - the risk of our competitors successfully adopting our business model in their own stores;

    - competitive pressure on product pricing from core competitors, as well as increasing competition from
discounters and online retailers;

41


-----

    - the risk of our competitors providing better service, quality, value or availability of products; and

    - the risk of our competitors better utilising customer data to provide personalised and efficient services,
including better loyalty and reward schemes and preferred pricing for loyalty and reward schemes’
members.

The performance of our competitors and changes in their pricing, promotions, product mix or other business
strategies, and our response (or failure to respond) to such competitive pressures, may lead to lower sales revenue,
higher operating expenses and/or lower profit margins and may require a significant amount of management attention
and resources, which may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our ongoing business operations.
There can be no assurance that, with evolving customer preferences, our customers will not shift towards competitors
with a different business model.

Even in geographies, channels and formats where we have a strong retail presence, we face the risk that new
retail market entrants may attempt to gain market share through pricing pressure. For example, the UK grocery retail
market has seen the rapid growth of discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and Lidl) that compete through
differentiation on price coupled with a more limited selection of own-brand products. We experience downward
pricing pressure, and if we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience additional downward
pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced retail margins, the inability to take advantage of new
business opportunities and the loss of market share, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

In recent years, and in particular during the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for online shopping services
has increased substantially and many of our competitors have expanded their online offerings. If our competitors are
able to offer faster or cheaper deliveries, and/or more convenient delivery options, we could lose current or potential
customers, our brand and reputation could suffer, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and enhance our online offering and the information
systems that support our online activities, as well as continue to optimise our logistics and distribution capabilities.
This may require the acquisition of equipment and software and the development, either internally or through
third-parties of new proprietary software and logistics and distribution solutions. In addition, any impairment of or
disruption to our supply chain or delivery fleet could result in a disruption in the delivery of our products to our online
customers, which could harm our brand and could generate additional costs. Furthermore, the online grocery industry
in the United Kingdom may not sustain or improve upon current levels of demand, and we may fail to develop our
online retail proposition to successfully appeal to a broader customer base and sustain current growth rates. If we are
unable to effectively compete with our online competitors or if we fail to retain and attract online customers, this may
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we may fail
to successfully compete with the growing convenience retail market, despite our growing presence is such market. If
we are unable to successfully expand our operations into the convenience retail market and the convenience retail
market continues to grow, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_We may be unable to manage risks relating to health and safety, sourcing, food safety and customer expectations_**
**_for both food and non-food products and in our stores and premises, which increases the risk of injury or loss of_**
**_life, reputational damage, and decreased customer confidence._**

Food and product safety and food hygiene and traceability (including in respect of product origins, freshness
and conditions of preservation through the supply chain) are top priorities for us: the actual safety of the food and
other products and services we offer, as well as the public’s perception of that safety, are essential to our business,
brand and reputation. Any event, such as a significant product recall or negative press reaction to statements made or
actions taken could damage our brand or reputation or cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of
the products we sell. We are also subject to a number of food safety and hygiene regulations. See “Business—
_Regulation—Food Safety, Hygiene, Labelling and Nutrition and Consumer Protection.” Failures to comply with these_
regulations could result in a number of adverse consequences, including fines, loss of licences, costs of compliance or
certification requirements.

We may not be able to ensure that our customers always enjoy safe, quality products. We sell food for human
consumption, which subjects us to safety risks such as contamination (including the presence of an undeclared

42


-----

allergen, a foreign object, substance, unintentional microbe or chemical, other agent or residue or the introduction of
a genetically modified organism, and other types of contamination caused by the presence of pests that are inherent to
the product in question or present where such product may be stored), spoilage, mislabelling, expired products and
product tampering, all of which could lead to product withdrawals or recalls or destruction of inventory and could
result in bad publicity, temporary store or warehouse closures and substantial costs in connection with compliance or
remediation. There is also a risk that products may not be sourced in a responsible or sustainable way. We may also
be impacted by any assertion that our products have caused illness or injury, whether true or false, proven or unproven.
We could also be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury stemming from product
contamination, spoilage, mislabelling, expired products, product tampering or any other incidents that compromise
the safety and quality of our products. From time to time we also recall products.

Risks to the health of our customers can also arise from our branded and own label suppliers, some of whom
are third parties who operate outside of our direct control, in relation to the ingredients, foods and products we sell in
our stores. For example, we rely on suppliers, some of whom are third parties who operate outside of our control, for
ingredients, foods and products we sell in our stores. Our use of third-party suppliers increases the risk that any of the
aforementioned types of incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations could
be affected. In addition, food or product safety-related risks may also occur under any one of our own-brand labels
and we may be impacted by negative publicity regarding any assertion that our food or other products have resulted
in illness or injury. Our customers expect that we will provide them with a large selection of safe, high-quality
products. Our colleagues are critical to maintaining our customer and supplier relationships and ultimately protecting
our reputation as a business. If we are unable to control and guarantee the quality of the products we sell, especially
our own-brand products and in-store services, our brand and reputation may be negatively impacted.

We rely upon electrical power to operate all our facilities across our distribution network. To attain maximum
performance, these types of facilities must often operate on a continuous basis and at the appropriate pre-set
temperatures. As a result, any shortage or interruption in power supply may result in food spoilage and any extended
power supply shortages or interruptions could result in perishable food losses, each of which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Actual recent increases and potential
future increases in wholesale energy prices may result in an increase in our costs incurred to maintain adequate and
constant power supply at our facilities. Cold chain requirements, setting out the temperatures at which our ingredients
and products must be stored and transported, are established both by law and by us to help guarantee the safety of our
food products. Our cold chain must be maintained from the moment the ingredients arrive at, or are frozen by, our
suppliers, through transportation and ultimately to the time of sale in our stores or delivery to our customers. In the
past, the United Kingdom has experienced shortages of CO2 due to the temporary shutdown of fertilizer manufacturing
facilities of which CO2 is a by-product and is an important component of our cold chain. CO2 is also used in the
preparation of some of the foods and beverages we produce or we otherwise buy from suppliers, for sale in our stores
and in the refrigeration technologies of some of the sites we acquired. A failure in our cold chain could lead to food
spoilage, risks to the health of our customers, fines and other penalties and damage to our brand and reputation, each
of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Consumers are increasingly focused on the traceability of food products to assist them in deciding what to
purchase. In January 2013, incidents of horse meat in parts of the European food supply chain mislabelled as beef
were identified, negatively impacting retailers and producers throughout Europe, including Asda, and led to additional
standards, such as BRC standards on traceability, food fraud and food defence. While we conduct quality practices
and procedures, it may be difficult to detect contamination, spoilage, mislabelling, product tampering or any other
incidents that compromise the safety and quality of our products, particularly fraudulent or malicious activity. Adverse
publicity about these types of problems, whether valid or not, may discourage customers from buying our products or
may affect our brand and reputation. Our actual or perceived sale of unsafe food products could result in product
liability claims, a loss of customer confidence, product recalls and legal claims, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A significant lawsuit, widespread product recall or other events leading to the loss of customer confidence in
the safety and quality of our products could damage our brand and reputation and negatively impact our sales,
profitability and prospects for growth. Further, if a product recall is required in circumstances where the financial
consequences are not covered by the relevant supplier or our insurance, it may have a material adverse effect on our
financial performance. Although we maintain product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will

43


-----

be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically
reasonable terms, or at all. Even if future product liability claims against us are unsuccessful, these claims could be
costly and time-consuming and may divert our management’s time and resources from operating our business and
may harm our brand and reputation.

We also face additional risks from product defects in relation to the sale of our non-food products, including,
for example, the risks of battery explosions, appliance malfunction or toys or other items that prove to be dangerous.
If products we purchase from our suppliers are damaged or defective, we may not be able to return products to these
suppliers and obtain refunds on our purchase price or obtain indemnification from them for any damages caused. Our
brand and reputation could be damaged by the marketing of such dangerous or defective products, especially in case
of serious defects, such as products containing harmful substances, causing death, physical harm or other health
problems. In addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by us or by our suppliers could occur, which could lead
to investigation by agencies responsible for customer product safety. In all such cases, especially if there is a prolonged
impact on product quality, our brand and reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations may be
materially adversely affected.

Certain risks are inherent in the operation of foodservice, serve-over and self-serve counters and our brand
and reputation could be damaged to the extent the quality of these facilities fall below our established standards. For
example, if particular temperatures and environments are not properly maintained, food safety could be compromised
and dangerous bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or Listeria monocytogenes could develop, which could cause harm
to our customers and ultimately impact our reputation. Additionally, these facilities are also subject to public
tampering and contamination, over which we have limited control.

Even if our products are not affected by contamination or other incidents that compromise their safety and
quality, we are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by widespread
contamination, widespread diseases (such as H1N1, SARS, MERS, BSE, COVID and avian influenza) and evolving
nutritional and health-related concerns. Regulatory authorities may limit the supply of certain types of food products
in response to public health concerns, and customers may perceive certain products to be unsafe or unhealthy, which
could require us or our suppliers to find alternative ingredients or products that may not be available at commercially
reasonable prices or within acceptable time constraints. In addition, such governmental regulations may require us to
identify replacement products for our customers or, alternatively, to discontinue certain offerings or limit the range of
product offerings. We may be unable to find substitutes that are as appealing to our customers, or such substitutes may
not be widely available or may be available only at increased costs. Such substitutions or limitations could also reduce
demand for our products. Each of the factors above may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. See also “—Any events that negatively impact the reputation of, or value
_associated with, our brands could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of_
_operations.”_

**_Our business is dependent on the economic situation in the United Kingdom and we are exposed to local, regional,_**
**_national and global economic, political, social and other trends that could materially adversely impact our business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

General economic conditions in the United Kingdom and globally may adversely affect our financial
performance. Higher interest rates, fluctuating petroleum product prices (including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline,
and diesel fuel), higher costs for raw materials as well as electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market,
inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in disposable
income, reduced access to customer credit, higher customer debt levels, changes in customer spending and shopping
patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax
laws, state-implemented austerity measures, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that
create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession
and other UK or global economic factors could materially adversely affect customer demand for the products we sell,
cause us to change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in
discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our revenue and result in slower inventory turnover and greater
markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and results of operations and could
result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other non-current assets.

44


-----

In addition to the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in
higher transportation, labour, insurance costs, fuel, energy or commodity prices, inflation, and other economic factors
could increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, following the easing of
COVID-19 lockdown measures across the United Kingdom in the first half of 2021, the increase in economic activity
has led to increased pressure across global supply chains, including in relation to labour shortages within the food
manufacturing supply chain (including shortages of heavy goods vehicle (“HGV”) drivers), which have resulted in
wage inflation; a lack of container capacity within global shipping, which has resulted in an increase in global shipping
rates; increases in wholesale energy prices; shortages of certain raw materials (including CO2) and increases in
commodity prices, which have resulted in input price inflation within the supply chain.

Unfavourable economic conditions or economic, social or political uncertainty globally or in the United
Kingdom could significantly adversely affect our revenue, growth and profitability and could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or ability to implement our strategy.

As a UK business, we are particularly affected by the economic, political and social conditions prevailing
from time to time in the United Kingdom. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our current profit levels
if adverse economic, political and social events or circumstances occur in the United Kingdom. See also “—The
_occurrence of catastrophic events, such as war, terrorist attacks, civil unrest, disruptive geopolitical events,_
_epidemics, pandemics and natural disasters, could materially adversely affect our and our suppliers’ (including other_
_third parties on which we rely) business, financial condition and results of operations.” Recent increases in rates of_
inflation and house prices in the United Kingdom, forecasted further increases in such inflation rates and house prices
and central banks’ responses to those increases, as well as other changes in economic conditions could impact
consumer spending, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations
or ability to implement our strategy. Economic downturns create increased pressure on margins for all retailers,
including us, and a significant economic downturn in the United Kingdom, or the impact of the current cost living
crisis, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inflationary
or deflationary pressures on the products we sell could also impact our net sales and earnings, and during financial
years 2022 and 2023, we experienced levels of inflation that are higher than we have experienced in recent years. If
the cost of goods changes as a result of inflation, we may be unable to adjust our retail prices accordingly, which could
adversely impact our sales or earnings. While we actively seek to manage our selling prices and production costs,
volumes, inventories and working capital, future changes in economic conditions in the United Kingdom could result
in short-term and long-term decreases in consumer confidence and demand, increases in selling prices and production
costs or the volatility of raw material prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Our suppliers and their respective businesses, whether in the United Kingdom or abroad, may also be
adversely affected by the same, similar or other economic, political and social factors that affect our operations, which
could result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain
suppliers not producing certain goods in the volume typically available to us for sale or at all. For example and as a
result of Brexit, we are faced with higher risks with regards to getting our products into the 18 stores we operate in
Northern Ireland. See “Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters—We are subject to regulations relating to the
_implementation of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.”_

In addition, our business is affected by unstable economic and political conditions and geopolitical conflicts,
such as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and escalating conflict in the Middle East (including tensions in
the Red Sea and between Israel and Iran). Whilst we are unable to forecast the long-term impact that this war will
have, according to the Bank of England, inflationary pressures intensified sharply following Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine. The Bank of England indicated that this has led to a material deterioration in the outlook for the world and
UK growth and has exacerbated the combination of adverse supply shocks that the United Kingdom and other
countries continue to face. The war in Ukraine and related sanctions have pushed up the cost of oil and other key
commodities. Moreover, this war could lead to additional market and other disruptions, including significant volatility
in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, volatility in foreign exchange
rates and interest rates, supply chain, labour and logistics interruptions, an increased risk of food availability and
integrity, as well as food fraud issues, increased wholesale prices, political and social instability, changes in consumer
or purchaser preferences as well as increase in cyberattacks and espionage. These factors have resulted in an increase

45


-----

in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our stores and costs to purchase products from our suppliers
and may make it more difficult to maintain our low prices or may result in decreased footfall at our stores or decreased
traffic for our online business.

As a result of the war in Ukraine, Europe is experiencing an energy crisis. For example, Russia’s closure of
the Nord Stream pipeline in September 2022 has threatened a large percentage of the European Union’s natural gas
supplies, which has led to energy price increases and could lead to shortages on the global energy market. Whilst some
costs such as energy prices may ultimately abate, there remains considerable uncertainty and the potential for price
volatility as a result of the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East (including as a result of tensions in the Red
Sea) which is likely to continue to impact consumer confidence and commodity prices. Inflationary pressures arising
from the ongoing war in Ukraine and energy crisis have contributed to a rise in the cost of living and a reduction in
disposal income for consumers. Our revenue and profitability are influenced by customer discretionary spending,
which is influenced by the cyclical nature of the general economy, levels of unemployment, population demographics,
inflationary/deflationary cycles, real disposable income, VAT increases, interest rates, the availability of customer
credit and customer perception of overall economic conditions and their own economic prospects, all of which are
factors beyond our control.

We are actively monitoring the war in Ukraine as well as the ongoing and increasing inflationary pressures
on consumer sentiment and spending and assessing its impact on our business. We expect these factors to adversely
impact the financial performance of the wider grocery market as well as our performance whilst these conditions
persist. We are unable to predict the nature and extent of inflationary pressures on our customers’ shopping habits and
the environment in which we and our suppliers operate. The extent and duration of Russia’s war in Ukraine, sanctions
and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global
economy and our business for an unknown period of time.

During periods of adverse economic, political and social conditions, we may also have difficulty accessing
financial markets, which could make it more difficult, more expensive or impossible to obtain funding for additional
investments to expand our business and operations or for refinancing, such that we may be unable to meet our debt
service obligations, including on the Senior Secured Notes, or other financial obligations as they become due. Any
prolonged adverse economic, political or social environment could make it difficult for us, as well as for our customers
and suppliers, to maintain current revenue and profitability levels and could materially limit our growth. In the past,
challenging market conditions have resulted in greater volatility and, in some cases, reduced liquidity, widening of
credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in credit markets. Each of the factors above may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Any events that negatively impact the reputation of, or value associated with, our brands could materially adversely_**
**_affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Our brand and reputation constitute a significant part of our value proposition. Our success has been founded
in part on our ability to develop our brand as a leading UK retailer of quality, competitively priced grocery, clothing
and general merchandise. Maintaining the reputation of and value associated with our brand is central to the success
of our business. This can be an especially difficult task for retailers, particularly in light of the development of social
media for advertising, including influencer marketing and brand partnerships with other third parties across the various
platforms in recent years, which has led to a sharp increase in reputational risks. Any event, such as a significant
product recall or negative press reaction to statements made or actions taken, or the failure to make certain statements
or take certain actions, by us or our senior management (or on our behalf by advertising partners), that could damage
our brand or reputation or cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of the products we sell could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our principal brand names and trademarks (such as the Asda logo) are key assets of our business. See
“Business—Our Intellectual Property.” We rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws to establish and
protect our intellectual property rights but cannot be certain that the actions we have taken or will take in the future
will be adequate to prevent material violation of our proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that litigation will
not be necessary to enforce our trademark or proprietary rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement
of the rights of third parties. Adverse publicity, legal action or other factors could lead to substantial erosion in the
value of our brand, which could lead to decreased customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. See also “Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters—From time to

46


-----

_time we and/or our management are subject to claims that can result in litigation, arbitration, tax or regulatory_
_proceedings which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability.”_

The brand names of our own-brand products also represent an important asset of our business. Certain of
these own-brand items are manufactured and/or packaged by third parties, and while our policies set out quality control
standards, we do not control these third parties or their quality control, employment, ethics or other business practices.
If we are unable to control and guarantee the quality of our own-brand products, our reputation may be damaged,
which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Maintaining broad market acceptance of our own-brand items depends on many factors, including pricing,
costs, quality and customer perception, and we may not achieve or maintain expected sales for our own-brand label
items. See also “Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters—We rely on certain suppliers and partners, some of
_which are third parties, and any failure by these suppliers and partners to comply with obligations could have a_
_materially adverse impact on our brand, reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition and our_
_agreements with these suppliers and partners may be subject to adjustments that could increase our expenses.”_

In light of the stringent employment, health and safety, environmental and other regulations to which we are
subject and the scrutiny we face from, among others, regulators, other national or local authorities, non-governmental
organisations and other stakeholders, a violation, or allegations of a violation of such laws or regulations, or a failure
to achieve particular standards by any of our suppliers or manufacturers we purchase goods from, could lead to
unfavourable publicity and a decline in demand for our products, or require us to incur additional costs or to make
changes to our supply chain and other business arrangements to ensure compliance. Any such events concerning us
or any of the manufacturers or suppliers that supply products to us could substantially erode the reputation of, or value
associated with, our brands and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results
of operations. Likewise, any failure to meet workplace health and safety or other legal standards and any death, injury
or illness to customers, colleagues, contractors, suppliers or third parties may lead to a loss of trust and confidence in
us, as well as litigation and/or financial or other penalties being imposed.

**_Sales of our products are subject to changing customer preferences and trends and we may be unable to_**
**_successfully or timely respond to these changing customer preferences._**

The success of our business depends on the continued appeal of the range of products and services we offer,
as well as our ability to provide an appealing omni-channel offering that draws new and returning customers. Given
the varied backgrounds and tastes of our customer base, we must offer a sufficient range of products to satisfy a broad
spectrum of preferences.

Demand for our food products is affected by customer tastes and preferences, which are impacted by, among
other things, social trends, health concerns, ethical considerations and culinary trends. Further to a review on customer
and product trends, customers are increasingly focused on health and wellness, including avoiding foods with certain
ingredients such as trans fats, gluten, sugar, sodium, processed wheat, animal products or other product attributes and
prefer foods which fit in to their image of a healthy lifestyle. Customers have also shown increasing preference for
vegan and organic products, ethically sourced products, environmentally-friendly product packaging and products that
support local business. The review suggests that other food trends include foods that can be cooked with just an oven,
on-the-go eating, comfort food with global influences, gourmet fast food and indulgent hybrid snack combinations.
We must adapt and develop products to address these trends and preferences in a timely manner in order to remain
competitive. Further, our customers increasingly expect a seamless omni-channel experience and when making a
decision to purchase products from us, want to be able to have access to greater amounts of information than ever
before, including on traceability, environmental sustainability and nutritional value. Likewise, our clothing, home
product lines and general merchandise offer are subject to changing customer tastes in apparel and decor which are
also impacted by sustainability considerations. Customers also increasingly expect to be able to interact with us in a
variety of ways, such as through mobile application purchases, which require investments in technology and human
resources. Customers also increasingly desire convenience and accessibility, requiring further investments to expand
our footprint in the convenience market, including under our Asda Express banner. In addition, in this current
economic environment, customers continue to experience cost pressures on their household budgets as they face a real
wage decline, increasing the importance of value or lower margin food and non-food offerings. However, consumer
patterns, which have increasingly been tending towards eating and working at home due to inflationary pressures and
the increase in working from home in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in the last three years, may reverse
and an increasing number of employees may return to working from the office or an increase in dining out once

47


-----

inflationary pressures subside, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.

If we do not identify or effectively respond to customer trends and preferences in a timely manner, or if we
fail to meet our customers’ expectations, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, our reputation,
the perception of our value proposition, demand for our products and services, our market share and the growth of our
business, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. It is difficult to quickly, consistently and successfully predict the products and services our customers will
be interested in and respond to changes in their shopping patterns. Responding to shifts in customer preferences and
expectations also can entail significant costs.

The success of our business depends on how accurately and quickly we predict customer demand, availability
of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Price
transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed, ease and cost of delivery or
collection options are of primary and increasing importance to customers, particularly as a result of the growth of
digital tools and social media that inform customers. Further, if we misjudge demand for certain products, particularly
for our non-food products, we may build up excess inventory for those products, which could result in a decrease in
their sales price and inefficient working capital management which, if material, could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Conservation measures, technological advances and negative shift in market perception towards the oil and gas_**
**_industry could reduce demand for fuel._**

As a retailer of petroleum-based fuel that increased its market presence following the EG UK Acquisition,
we may be unable to adapt to fast-paced developments regarding climate change and the impact of petroleum-based
fuel on the environment, which may alter consumer sentiments and lead to the increased use of alternative fuels.
Increasing attention to climate change, fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, incentives to
conserve energy or use alternative energy sources (such as electric vehicles and biofuels), increasing consumer
demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation
devices may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our fuel and reduced revenues.

Global efforts to respond to the challenges of climate change may also have an impact on the demand for the
price of oil and gas moving forward, as countries increasingly shift toward alternative energy sources, which may in
turn impact our revenues in the long term if we are unable to achieve or maintain a sufficiently low break-even price.
In particular, the automobile industry has focused heavily on reduced fuel consumption, a trend that will likely
continue with improvements to alternative fuels such as electricity, hydrogen or compressed natural gas. If customers
and the automobile industry continue to embrace electric and hybrid vehicles and alternative fuels, this could have an
adverse impact on our growing fuel business, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
For example, in October 2022, the European Union adopted legislation requiring a 55% CO2 emission reduction for
new cars and 50% for new vans by 2030 compared to 2021 levels and for a 100% CO2 emission cut by 2035, effectively
prohibiting the sale of new combustion engine cars. Should similar legislation be enacted in the United Kingdom, this
could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower-or-zero-carbon
emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for, and in turn the prices of, the fuel we sell, which could have
an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

In addition, institutional lenders may, of their own accord, elect not to provide or place additional restrictions
on funding for fuel-linked companies based on climate change related concerns, which could affect our access to
capital for potential growth projects and other financing requirements.

**_Our business and the markets in which we operate may be adversely impacted by climate change, adverse weather_**
**_conditions, the carbon transition and climate change regulation._**

Climate change, including the impact of global warming, subjects our businesses to a broad range of risks at
several different levels. Our operations are subject to physical risks across all regions of operation, which include an
increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as rapid changes in precipitation and extreme weather
events. For example, global shipping may be disrupted as a result of extreme weather patterns.

48


-----

Food production systems require a diverse range of plants, animals, bacteria and fungi, both for the direct
supply of food and to sustain the underlying ecosystem processes that make agriculture possible – from water supply
to soil fertility enhancement, pollination and natural pest control. Changing global weather patterns in the geographies
of food production systems may negatively impact or destroy the ecosystems where products grow, in turn affecting
such products’ availability and/or quality. In addition, water resources are vital to food production systems and the
scarcity of such resources may have an adverse impact on agricultural production and yields. See “Business—Our
_Quality Control System, Health and Safety and Environmental Policies—Our Environmental, Social and Governance_
_Goals—Our ESG Priority Areas—Energy and Climate Mitigation.” Other climate-related issues such as adverse_
weather conditions may have a significant impact on our operations, property, supply chain (particularly in our fresh
food offering) and our ability to maintain availability on our shelves.

We also face transitional risks related to climate change. Developments related to climate change may
expedite a transition away from the use of carbon-intensive sources for energy generation and products derived from
certain fossil fuels, which could have a material and adverse effect on us if we are not able to demonstrate that our
products align with a low-carbon transition or we are not able to meet our carbon transition targets. As a retailer, we
recognise that we have a responsibility to minimise the adverse impact that our business activities have on the
environment. Failure to do this may result not only in adverse environmental impacts, but also financial penalties and
long-term damage to our reputation. As the global climate crisis becomes more critical, there is a risk that we will fail
to address climate-related impacts on our business in reputational, operational and financial terms and may not meet
stakeholder expectations.

In addition, we are subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change and the emission of
greenhouse gases including with respect to our supply chain, and compliance with related rules could be difficult and
costly. We could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with
existing or new greenhouse gas emission laws and regulations. Failure to comply with any such laws and regulations
could result in penalties as well as adverse consequences to our reputation and image among our customers and
stakeholders. The realisation of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The occurrence of major failures or catastrophic events, such as war, terrorist attacks, civil unrest, disruptive_**
**_geopolitical events, epidemics, pandemics, natural disasters and technology disruptions, could materially adversely_**
**_affect our and our suppliers’ (including other third parties on which we rely) business, financial condition and_**
**_results of operations._**

The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes,
tropical storms, tornadoes, cyclones and typhoons; weather and climate conditions, such as winter and summer storms,
heatwaves, severe cold weather and droughts, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; geo-political events;
public health situations, such as epidemics, pandemics and other contagious outbreaks, such as the global coronavirus
pandemic; and catastrophic events, such as war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active
shooter situations, knife attacks, technology disruptions (including cyber-attacks), as well as protests, strikes and
boycotts could materially adversely affect our and our suppliers’ (including other third parties on which we rely)
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Such events could result in closure of, physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our and
our suppliers’ (including other third parties on which we rely) properties, limitations on operating hours, workforce
shortages, the inability of customers and colleagues to reach or have transportation to our stores and facilities, the
evacuation of the population from areas in which our stores and facilities are located, the unavailability of our online
platforms or our delivery and Click & Collect services, changes in customer purchasing patterns and in disposable
income, disruptions to supply and logistics chain, reduced availability of products in our stores, disruptions to utilities
for our stores and facilities, increased freight costs and wholesale energy prices, shortage of raw materials and
disruptions to our communications network. Responding to such events and their effects may require a significant
amount of management attention and resources, which may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our
ongoing business operations.

In particular, COVID-19 had a significant impact on our operations, including by, among other things,
requiring us to manage customer numbers at our premises, reduce the operation of certain stores depending on the
guidelines or orders of the relevant government, invest in protective and other safety equipment, accelerate the

49


-----

deployment of automated check-outs, increase our capacity for home delivery and Click & Collect purchase options,
build up our inventory of consumer staples and undertake a transition to a remote work environment for our corporate
offices in response to new regulatory requirements. Whilst many of these measures are no longer necessary, we have
retained a few, such as automated check-out services for our customers and the ability for certain of our colleagues to
adopt a hybrid work routine. A renewed COVID-19 outbreak or any other future pandemic, could result in disruptions
to our supply chain, divert management’s attention, adversely affect the price of, availability of and demand for certain
food products or limit the total number of customers that may be in the store at any one time. Any of the foregoing
impacts of COVID-19 or any other future pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. The scope and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted because of the
unprecedented nature of COVID-19 or similar events.

We risk exposure to losses incurred as a result of damage to, or destruction of, our and our suppliers’
(including other third parties on which we rely) stores and facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and business and
service interruption caused by such events. These events and their impact could otherwise disrupt and materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “—Risks Relating to Legal and
_Regulatory Matters—We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to significant_
_financial risks if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate.” Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurance_
that we would be able to successfully recover our costs, in full or in part, should we experience an event of the types
described above or other business continuity problem. Each of the factors above may have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are vulnerable to cost inflation and fluctuations in the availability and price of food ingredients and products,_**
**_commodities and packing material, as well as to fluctuations in the price of electricity and fuel and labour,_**
**_transportation and manufacturing costs._**

Our results of operations are influenced by market prices for certain essential food ingredients and products,
commodities, packing materials, gas, electricity and fuel, as well as other raw materials and energy-related costs and
labour, transportation and manufacturing costs. Increases in prices or scarcity of any of these ingredients, commodities,
products or materials required for our business could materially increase our costs and disrupt our operations. Food
cost inflation, particularly during periods of rapid inflation, could reduce our operating margins as it may reduce the
demand for our products. In addition, there may be a lag between the occurrence of the price increase and the time at
which we are able to increase the price of our products and pass them on to our customers. Volatility in the price and
availability of raw materials can result from a wide variety of factors beyond our control, including poor harvests,
shortages or interruptions, weather conditions, disease, political instability and changes in climate, among many other
factors. Events such as Brexit, COVID-19 lockdowns, the war in Ukraine or the threat of political or social unrest (or
the perceived threat thereof) have had or may have a material adverse impact on commodity, product or material
prices, the availability of food ingredients and products, and labour, transportation and manufacturing costs. See “—
_Our business is dependent on the economic situation in the United Kingdom and we are exposed to local, regional,_
_national and global economic, political, social and other trends that could materially adversely impact our business,_
_financial condition and results of operations.”_

Notwithstanding our hedging policies, we cannot fully eliminate the risks of price movements or risks
associated with the availability of food products and ingredients. For example, we are currently experiencing
industry-wide retail price inflation arising from labour shortages, the war in Ukraine, increases in the cost of key
commodities, freight inflation, the shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers and increases in wholesale energy prices,
which may cause our suppliers to raise their prices, which could materially increase our costs and negatively impact
our business. Whilst it is not possible to predict the long-term impact of the war in Ukraine, it has resulted in significant
volatility in the price of energy and price and availability of agricultural and other commodities in the short-term (such
as wheat, for example), as well as volatility in the market price of commodities. Our ability to pass along increased
costs through price increases to our customers depends upon competitive conditions in our industry and pricing
regulations and may not be compatible with our business ethos and strategy. If we are unable to pass such cost
increases on to our customers or if the higher cost of the products offered results in decreased demand for our products,
our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our brand, may be materially adversely affected.

Food purchases account for a significant portion of our cost of goods sold. The prices of ingredients that we
and our suppliers purchase are subject to volatility. Such fluctuations are attributable to, among other things, global
commodity prices (which may be because of such commodity’s availability), currency exchange rates, and fiscal

policy support for agriculture. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022, for example, led to significant rises in the
price and availability of key ingredients, such as sunflower oil. The increase in inflation globally and the United
Kingdom since 2022 has also increased our costs of acquiring ingredients, products, and the volatility of prices, and
this inflation impact continues. See also “—Our business is dependent on the economic situation in the United
_Kingdom and we are exposed to local, regional, national and global economic, political, social and other trends that_
_could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.” Our operations are_
dependent on a number of key supplier relationships, including our relationship with our wholly-owned subsidiary,
IPL. As a result, we may be impacted by inbound cost inflation earlier than our competitors. We may not be able to
preserve our profit margin during periods of increased food inflation without suffering reduced revenue, which in turn
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Increases in prices or scarcity of ingredients or packaging materials required for our products could increase
our costs and disrupt our operations. In addition, our ability to pass along increased costs through price increases to
our customers depends upon competitive conditions in our industry and pricing regulations. If we are unable to pass
such cost increases on to our customers or the higher cost of the products offered results in decreased demand for our
products, our profitability, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.

In addition, fuel prices have remained high with the potential to increase the operating costs of our sites,
which require large quantities of energy to regulate store & warehouse temperatures, in particular cold chain storage
facilities that ensure the integrity of our products prior to sale, as well as fuel required for our vehicle fleet, which we
cannot guarantee will not increase in the future. Energy costs, impacted by reduced Russian supply due to the ongoing
war in Ukraine, have reduced and stabilised but remain higher than at any time since June 2021, and the risk of supply
disruption and price volatility has increased due to tensions in the Middle East and Red Sea shipping routes. Increases
in energy costs, whether driven by increased demand, decreased or disrupted supply or an anticipation of any such
events will increase the costs of operating our stores. In addition, while shipping costs had previously fallen, these
have more than doubled since the end of 2023 due to maritime traffic in the Red Sea. This has increased import prices
in the short term with longer shipping times causing a reduction of supplies of intermediate inputs and consumer goods
and the outlook for shipping costs remains uncertain. Increases in energy costs, whether driven by increased demand,
decreased or disrupted supply or an anticipation of any such events will increase the costs of operating our stores.

Fluctuations in the price of fuel products may also negatively affect the business of our petrol stations. Any
increase in the prices at which we purchase our fuel inventory or our costs in partnering with third parties could
adversely affect the margins on the fuel and non-fuel products and services we sell at our forecourts, and we may not
be able to raise our prices due to economic conditions, competition, regulation, contractual terms or other factors. Fuel
prices have been high in recent years and have fluctuated as a result of various factors, many of which are beyond our
control, such as global and regional supply and demand, geopolitical and economic uncertainty, including the
Russia-Ukraine war which has threatened supply lines and resulted in embargoes of certain supply sources, and the
most recent escalation of the conflict in the Middle East (including tensions in the Red Sea), as well as pricing and
availability of competing alternative fuel technologies. In addition, our fuel margins have increased materially in the
past few years, and there is a risk that the margins may revert back to previous levels in the future. Changing fuel
prices and the inability to project future prices can from time to time impact our business. For example, changing fuel
prices affect the market value of our fuel inventories and expose us to significant fluctuations in the recorded value of
our inventory and the related costs of goods sold, thus reducing our profit margins. In particular, when fuel cost prices
increase, whether as a result of governmental intervention or global oil market conditions, we may not always be able
to pass such increases onto our customers, which may reduce our fuel margins. Fluctuations in fuel cost prices may
be exacerbated in the future, for example, as a result of environmental legislation or regulation or we may face pressure
from consumers and governments to not increase our fuel retail prices. As such, there can be no assurance that the
price of fuel will remain stable or that we will be able to pass any price increases onto our consumers, in a timely
manner or at all, resulting in higher expenses, lower margins and other material adverse effects on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may be unable to implement our business strategy or to successfully maintain and develop our omni-channel_**
**_offer and, along with the increasing complexity of our business and costs associated with our business strategy,_**

51


-----

**_this may reduce demand for our products and services and materially adversely impact our relationships with our_**
**_customers, market share, results of operations, financial condition and prospects._**

Our future performance is dependent on our ability to identify and develop business opportunities and to
successfully execute our business strategy and adapt our value proposition to relevant customer trends. See
“Business—Key Strengths” and “Business—Business Strategy.” Failure to properly deploy capital and other resources
to further our strategy may negatively affect our planned initiatives. Any misjudgements, flaws or inadequacies in our
execution could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

The retail business continues to rapidly evolve, and consumers increasingly embrace online shopping,
convenience and accessibility. As a result, the portion of total customer expenditures with retailers occurring through
online platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. Accordingly, an important part of our
business strategy involves offering a seamless omni-channel customer experience by integrating innovative online
and mobile application-based solutions. Our ability to adapt our online offer and, in particular, to develop online sales
depends on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully market our websites and social media, our ability
to identify additional key partnerships for the expansion of our online channels, the capability of our existing
distribution network to accommodate our growing online operations and the ability to successfully leverage our
expanding online operations. However, we cannot assure you that our online operations will continue to grow.
Expansion into the convenience and foodservice market is also a key part of our strategy. However, this expansion
into convenience and foodservice may not be successful. It may require substantial additional capital expenditures,
and we may not be able to compete with well-established competitors.

In addition, integrating innovative omni-channel options into the retail store experience is critical for us to
maintain our market position. Omni-channel retailing continues to evolve, our customers are increasingly more likely
to shop across multiple channels that work in tandem, and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations
and new developments. The portion of total consumer purchases occurring online and through mobile applications, as
well as smaller store convenience formats, has continued to increase. The pace of this increase could further accelerate
in the future. Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous
channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. We are making investments in our
websites, mobile applications and new store formats. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant
customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or adapt our store estate or logistic network to keep up with the growth
of our online and convenience sectors, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected.
Our strategy also relies on identifying, developing and/or adopting key technology solutions that allow us to integrate
innovative online shopping processes into our operations. We may not be able to secure the requisite technology to
implement our strategy, either due to cost or intellectual property rights of third parties. We may also fail to integrate
new digital tools into our systems which could reduce their effectiveness.

Our strategy, which includes investments in online channels, technology, store remodels and other
customer-focused initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our business, maintain or grow our
overall market position or otherwise offset the impact of the growth of our business. The success of our strategy will
depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping
experience for our customers. Failure to successfully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position
and financial performance. In addition, increased online sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result
in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store sales
of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and materially adversely affect
our financial performance.

Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot
guarantee the successful execution of our business strategy. Additionally, the implementation of our strategy may put
operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our existing business
operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results initially expected, we may be unable to
recover our investment, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Furthermore, the cost of certain online and technology investments, including any operating losses
incurred, could adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realise the benefits of these
investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term.

**_Competitive pressures in the apparel, footwear and homeware retail industries are high, which may impact our_**
**_ability to compete successfully against existing or future competitors._**

The apparel, footwear and homeware retail industries are each highly competitive and the marketplace is
highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilising a variety of store and on-line
formats and merchandising strategies. The George Clothing and George Home brands compete on the basis of, among
other things, the location of our stores; website, mobile applications and their respective design; the breadth, quality,
style price and availability of our merchandise; and the level of customer service offered. In particular, the George
Clothing brand faces competition from other low-cost and fast fashion retailers that have recently made significant
price investments in their merchandise offerings and target some of the same categories of customers as the George
Clothing brand. We expect competition to increase in the future. There are no significant economic barriers for others
to enter our apparel, footwear and homeware retail sectors and our existing competitors are constantly adjusting their
pricing, business strategies and promotional activity (particularly during holiday periods) in response to changing
market conditions or their own financial condition.

Additionally, the substantial sales growth in online apparel, footwear and homeware retail within the last
decade has encouraged the entry of many new competitors, new business models and an increase in competition from
established companies looking for ways to create successful online shopping alternatives. The internet and other
technologies also facilitate comparison shopping in our apparel, footwear and homeware retail segments. Our digital
channel competes against numerous websites, mobile applications and catalogues, which may have a greater volume
of circulation and web traffic or more effective marketing through online media and social networking sites. We offer
an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and use social media and mobile applications as a way to
interact with them to enhance their shopping experiences. Omni-channel retailing is constantly evolving, and we must
keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. There is no assurance that
we will be able to continue to successfully maintain or expand our digital sales channels and respond to shifting
consumer traffic patterns and digital buying trends. Our inability to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties
or successfully maintain and expand our digital business could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or future competitors. Intense
pressures from our competitors, our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to a changing competitive landscape or
a failure to effectively execute our model to retain and win customers in our targeted customer categories, could reduce
demand for our merchandise, decrease our inventory turnover, cause us to take greater markdowns and negatively
affect our sales and margins.

**_The efficiency of our supply chain is critical to our business and operations. Significant disruptions in our_**
**_production and/or distribution, particularly for perishable goods, could materially adversely affect our business,_**
**_financial condition and results of operations._**

We are subject to risks associated with delivery of products to our customers through our hub and spoke
logistics model and our delivery fleet, which operates predominantly by road, but also indirectly through third parties’
deliveries by deep-sea freight and air. We operate with tailored logistics structures concentrated in a relatively small
number of distribution facilities to supply and deliver our products. There is a risk that any of these facilities may be
materially adversely affected by extraordinary events, such as a fire or an explosion. In some such cases, insurance is
subject to limitations and therefore may not cover all of our losses. See “Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory
_Matters—We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to significant financial_
_risks if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate.” Any increases in the cost of transportation, including as a_
result of increased fuel prices or environmental regulations or initiatives that mandate more costly methods of
transport, could significantly increase our cost of doing business. The efficiency and functioning of our supply chain
without disruptions or delays is essential, especially for our fresh food products.

Changes in our logistics structures, including as a result of impacts to our facilities, labour disruptions, fleet
problems, natural events, technical disruptions, malfeasance or accidents, could lead to a temporary or extended
disruption of our operations, disrupt product availability and inventory management and have a negative impact on
our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the invasion of Ukraine by
Russia, increases in freight costs through increased fuel prices and surcharges and increases in oil prices, delays in
manufacturing and transportation due to congestions at ports of loading and ports of entry (such as freight disruptions
arising from port-of-entry limitations or restrictions in the United Kingdom during late 2021 and 2022, resulting from

53


-----

supply chain disruptions triggered by COVID-19 and compounded by port congestion and border control restrictions
attributed to Brexit and most recently), as a result of the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East (including tensions
in the Red Sea, and their impact on global shipping routes), quality control issues, a supplier’s financial distress,
natural disasters or health crises, regulatory actions or ethical sourcing issues, trade sanctions or other external factors
over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have
had or may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, disruption as a result of major incidents or external events can have a number of impacts, for
example increased freight costs and wholesale energy prices and shortage of raw materials. Any disruption to our
supply chain or suppliers can impact our future. There is no assurance that such pressures will not increase in the
future which could materially increase our costs and impact our business. Sourcing and supply chain challenges could
also be exacerbated through climate change as adverse weather conditions increasingly disrupt our ability to source,
transport and deliver goods whilst also impacting our customers’ ability to access our stores.

Furthermore, the growth of our business is subject to limitations on the capacity of our current supply chain
network and our ability to expand that network to meet our changing needs. Our failure to grow our supply chain
network in line with the growth of our business could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects. In addition, should we lose our supply chain finance providers, our ability to pay
our suppliers on time may be impaired and our relationships with suppliers might suffer as a result, which could
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Risks Relating to Our
_Capital Structure and the Senior Secured Notes—We may be unable to access the short-term and long-term funding_
_required to meet business needs.”_

**_We rely on certain suppliers and partners, some of which are third parties, and any failure by these suppliers and_**
**_partners to comply with obligations could have a materially adverse impact on our brand, reputation, business,_**
**_results of operations and financial condition and our agreements with these suppliers and partners may be subject_**
**_to adjustments that could increase our expenses._**

We have active business relations with more than 5,900 suppliers as of December 31, 2023, including in
relation to our own-brand products. See “Business—Our Suppliers and Logistics.” In addition to IPL, we are also
dependent on certain third-party suppliers for our products, which exposes us to risks that such suppliers may fail to
meet timelines, provide us with sufficient inventory or comply with our specifications. If a delay or interruption of
delivery were to occur either temporarily or permanently for any reason, we may not be able to meet customer demand,
which may result in fewer sales and may harm our brand. For example, there is an increased risk within the import
business due to tensions in the Red Sea, and their impact on global shipping routes. In addition, the recent constraints
on global freight and cargo capacity as well as the ongoing shortages of qualified HGV drivers may in turn reduce,
and in certain instances has reduced, the traditional range of products available to our customers. Further, as we require
our suppliers to meet certain specifications and standards to ensure the quality of our products, the use of third-party
suppliers increases the demands on our quality control personnel. If the products provided by our suppliers do not
meet the relevant quality standards, our reputation may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we depend on
certain of our suppliers for certain of our successful popular own-brand products which contribute to store traffic and
sales. Any disruption of delivery of these key high-volume products may have a material adverse effect on our sales.
Further, the associated reputational risks are heightened in the context of suppliers who supply and/or manufacture
our own-brand products. See also “—Any events that negatively impact the reputation of, or value associated with,
_our brands could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_

There can be no guarantee that we will not be required to make changes to our supplier base, and at any point
may be required to contract with other suppliers on less favourable terms and/or at a greater cost. While we have
long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, and alternate suppliers are generally available, we do not have
long-term contracts with all of our suppliers. As a result, certain of our suppliers could increase their prices or fail to
deliver sufficient quantities to us in a timely fashion or at all. There is also a risk that suppliers will consolidate, giving
us fewer choices and creating pricing pressure. Any deterioration in our relationships with our suppliers, the imposition
of stricter conditions by suppliers (especially with respect to stringent payment terms or as a result of the willingness
of credit insurers to reduce the exposure of our suppliers) or the non-renewal of our key supply agreements may have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we experience a need to
replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that additional suppliers will be available when required on
terms acceptable to us. In addition, even if we were able to find new suppliers on acceptable terms, we may encounter

54


-----

delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it would take to train such suppliers in our methods,
products, quality control standards, employment, health and safety standards.

Our operations are dependent on a number of key supplier relationships, including IPL. While IPL is
wholly-owned by Asda, any interruption to IPL’s operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial
condition and results of operations. In addition, we are dependent on suppliers of the machinery used within our hub
and spoke facilities for their continued supply and maintenance. We are also dependent on other third parties, including
landlords and distributors, and other suppliers. If any such suppliers ceased operations or was temporarily unable to
supply its respective services, this could materially adversely affect our operations or financial condition until an
alternative supplier is found, and there could be no guarantee that any alternative supplier would be as satisfactory as
the existing arrangements. Any adverse changes to our relationships with these suppliers and third parties or in a
reduction in availability or level of service offered by these suppliers and third-party providers could restrict our ability
to conduct our business and thereby adversely impact our financial condition and prospects.

Our relationship with suppliers based in foreign markets presents certain risks. For example, if such suppliers
are non-compliant with labour laws on manufacturing and the values listed in the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the ILO’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, we could be subject to action from
international trade unions with whom we have no day-to-day relationship. There is also a risk that our suppliers may
not comply with relevant anti-corruption laws, health and safety laws, environmental laws or other laws and
regulations, which could result in reputational damage to Asda’s brand, loss of consumer trust or human rights or
anti-corruption law investigations of Asda. In addition to non-compliance with international or domestic labour, health
and safety laws or environmental laws, we face a variety of risks generally associated with sourcing products from
suppliers in foreign markets, including, among others, political instability; increased security requirements applicable
to foreign goods; the imposition of taxes, duties, other charges and restrictions on imports; currency and exchange rate
risks; risks related to environmental matters or other issues in the foreign countries or factories in which our products
are manufactured; delays in shipping; and increased costs of transportation. Any of these risks, in isolation or in
combination, could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Increased transportation costs or disruption to transportation services could materially adversely impact our_**
**_business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Cost-effective transportation of our products is an important element of our cost structure. We depend on the
use of refrigerated trailers for the shipping of certain of our products from our suppliers’ facilities to our distribution
centres, from our distribution centres to our stores and from our stores and distribution centres to our customers. Asda
drivers deliver goods to stores and customers using a fleet of leased tractors, trailers and vans, as well as occasional
spot-hire or third-party hauliers. See “Business—Our Suppliers and Logistics.” Transportation costs have historically
fluctuated significantly over time, in particular in connection with oil prices, and increases in transportation costs
could result in reduced profits. For example, more recently we have experienced increases in global shipping rates
resulting from increased demand for container-based shipping and increases in the cost of fuel for our HGV fleet
resulting from increases in the global price of oil, which, especially if protracted, could materially increase our costs
and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, climate change related
taxes and levies are a large portion of the energy related costs required to maintain the cold chain. These climate
change related taxes have been increasing in recent years and are expected to increase in the future.

We are subject to regulations governing the number of hours and days that drivers can work consecutively,
and as a result, we may not have enough drivers available to work during periods of very high demand or adverse
weather conditions. Additionally, we face competition from other retailers and businesses in hiring and retaining
drivers and couriers for our delivery services and distribution network. Moreover, delivery service is also a field with
inherent high attrition rate and job mobility. We have been facing sustained freight inflation, plus a shortage of heavy
goods vehicle drivers across the United Kingdom. In addition, the reduction in the number of EU nationals working
in the United Kingdom following Brexit has led to shortages of staff at national food suppliers and in the food supply
chain, as well as a shortage of drivers in the logistics sector. As a result, we may not be able to hire a sufficient number
of drivers to meet our demand, which may result in us paying increased labour costs in order to attract new drivers or
retain existing ones. Continued labour shortages or increased labour costs could materially adversely impact our
business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, climate change related taxes and levies are a large
portion of the energy related costs required to maintain the cold chain. These climate change related taxes have been
increasing in recent years and are expected to increase in the future. Any increases in the cost of labour or

55


-----

transportation, including as a result of increased fuel prices or environmental regulations or initiatives that mandate
more costly methods of transport, could significantly increase our cost of doing business. An impairment or loss of
one or more distribution centres due to accidents, fires, technical disruptions, sabotage or other events, or an
impairment or disruption in IPL’s or other suppliers’ service, including significant price increases, could result in a
temporary disruption in the delivery of products to our stores and additional costs. Although we believe that we would
be able to find an alternative distribution centre or an alternative operator, if necessary, we may be unable to find
alternative providers in a timely fashion, on reasonable terms, or at all. We also require last-mile transport for our
delivery services, which is one of the most expensive parts of the transportation process. Changes in these agreements
governing the relationships with these providers could also result in reduced profits. Any increases in the cost of
transportation, and any disruption to our transportation and logistics systems, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may enter into transactions with related parties in the ordinary course of business or otherwise._**

From time to time, following disclosure in line with internal governance policies, we have entered and may
enter into arm’s length transactions with affiliates that may be considered related party transactions. For example, we
have in the past and may in the future, enter into transactions with EG Group, which is also owned by our shareholders.
Following the EG UK Acquisition, many of our transactions with the EG Group business that had been considered
“affiliate transactions” ceased to be affiliate transactions by virtue of the fact that we now own the EG UK Business
and such business forms part of the Group. However, there can be no assurance that we will not enter into future
transaction with EG Group or other related parties.

We disclose all material related party transactions in our financial statements and have implemented certain
policies and procedures whereby certain employees and committees screen each of the material transactions for any
possible affiliations between us and companies controlled by us or our shareholders. See note 30 (“Related parties”)
to the 2023 Financial Statements appearing herein for further disclosure on our related party transactions. See also
“Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” In addition, we maintain robust internal governance
procedures whereby we screen every agreement we enter into to determine if it is an affiliate transaction by
cross-checking the party to our list of affiliates. In the event a counterparty is an affiliate, we work closely with our
controllership and corporate governance teams to ensure that transactions are conducted at arm’s length. Although our
corporate governance guidelines require that we engage in any related party transactions on an arm’s length basis,
there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favourable to us as would be the case had
they not been with related parties. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialise, might
adversely affect the public’s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter
into new relationships in the future, including with competitors of such related parties, which could harm our business
and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to keep pace with new technological developments in the online grocery business._**

Consumer expectations regarding the use of digital tools and omni-channel shopping are rapidly evolving, with
customers seeking to prioritise retailers that offer technological solutions that reduce shopping and checkout times.
One of our objectives is to use digital tools to enhance the in-store experience from product selection to checkout and
further develop the omni-channel retail experience we offer our customers. We rely in part on third parties for
development of and access to such new technologies and tools. We expect that new services and technologies will
continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies that
we currently use. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures
and take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and
develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, or third parties’
intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to new
technological changes and evolving industry standards.

**_We face certain risks in relation to our online presence, which is a rapidly evolving part of our operations, including_**
**_as regards data privacy, security breaches, hacking and vandalism. These cyber-attacks or data breaches materially_**
**_adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

Our online channels are currently supported by a number of legacy technology platforms, all of which will be
replaced in 2024 with new systems as part of Project Future. Further, we have successfully converted seven depots as

56


-----

of March 31, 2024 as part of our new Warehouse Management system “Manhattan” (with two more in progress) and
have implemented our new store till systems across many stores. These online channels, which are increasingly
important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, are
regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorised access to our websites and
mobile applications to obtain and misuse customers’ information, including payment information. Such attacks, if
successful, in addition to potential data misuse, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or
sabotage one or more of our online platforms, which may significantly disrupt our customers’ shopping experience.
If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable
parameters, we could suffer sanction, loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration
of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential
information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our
business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy or the growth of our business. Any of these
risks could be amplified if we are unable to smoothly transition onto our new IT system as part of Project Future.

The UK online grocery industry is still developing and rapidly evolving. Our online grocery operations must,
therefore, be considered in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter operating in an industry that is still evolving.
These risks and difficulties include:

    - managing rapid growth in personnel and operations;

    - developing sufficient management and technology capability in a rapidly evolving industry;

    - managing and further developing a complex business system;

    - capital expenditures associated with the development of our online operations and support functions;

    - risks surrounding online payments;

    - further development to our infrastructure and technology solutions;

    - maintaining our profit margins if consumer preferences shift overall to prefer online sales over brickand-mortar store sales; and

    - accurately predicting future capacity requirements and ability to maintain or grow market share.

Furthermore, we may be affected by an increase in governmental regulation of the internet and/or online
retail. The application or modification of existing laws or regulations, or adoption of new laws and regulations
governing the internet and online retail operations could materially adversely affect the manner in which we currently
conduct our online business. The legislative framework governing the internet remains largely unsettled, even in areas
where there has been some legislative action. In addition, the growth and development of the market for online retail
may lead to more stringent customer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on us, all of which may have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.

We may be subject to privacy or data protection failures, including in respect of the General Data Protection
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of EUWA (the “UK GDPR”). We collect, process
and utilise personal data from customers, business contacts, colleagues and other third-parties, marketing initiatives
and the large number of credit and debit transactions we process, and the failure to adequately maintain and protect
such information, or failure to comply with applicable data protection laws, including by providing adequate privacy
notices to our online users, ensuring lawful use of the data, fulfilling rights requests and maintaining consents, could
increase the risk of data loss or misuse or other data breaches and could have a material adverse effect on our brand,
reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See also “—We collect and process
_personal data in our daily business, and the leakage of such data may violate law and could materially adversely_
_affect our business.”_

We rely on third-party service providers to process customer payments made using debit cards and credit
cards. Our online operations depend heavily upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public
networks, including the use of cashless payments. The use and handling of this personal information is regulated by

57


-----

evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations at the sub-national, national and international level, as well
as by certain third-party contracts. The legal and regulatory frameworks governing the use and handling of personal
information are relatively new and are still evolving. If we or any of our third-party service providers fail to store,
transmit and purge customer information in a secure or otherwise compliant manner, if our security and information
systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, a cyberattack or a network security incident, or if our
colleagues or certain third-parties fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations (and, as a result, information
about our customers or colleagues is obtained by unauthorised persons and/or used inappropriately), we could be
subject to liabilities and penalties, damage to our reputation, litigation or government enforcement actions, substantial
costs and a loss of customer confidence, all of which may significantly adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarise results and manage our business._**
**_These systems are interdependent and disruptions in the IT infrastructure that we use could materially adversely_**
**_affect our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

We rely on an extensive array of information systems (including servers, networks, applications, websites
and databases) that are essential to the operation and management of our activities. The development, implementation
and continuous and uninterrupted performance of our hardware, network, applications, website and other systems,
including those which may be provided by third parties, are important factors in our delivery of products and services
to our customers. We are dependent on our technical infrastructure and computer applications for all aspects of the
day-to-day management of our business, including purchasing, sourcing, distribution, online sales, customer delivery,
data exploitation, invoicing, cash collection, reporting and consolidation, as well as electronic data exchange and
access to internal information, all of which provide necessary information upon which management makes its business
decisions.

Our performance depends on accurate, timely information and numerical data from key software applications
to aid day-to-day business and decision-making processes. We are exposed to operational risks, such as the breakdown
or failure of equipment, interruption of power supplies or processes, fires, floods or other natural disasters, acts of
sabotage or vandalism, and industrial accidents. We rely on our information technology systems for communication
among our suppliers, stores, distribution centres and headquarters and for our online sales. We may be adversely
affected if our controls fail to detect or contain operational risks. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the
resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain the related automated
and manual control processes, we could be subject to adverse effects, including billing and collection errors, business
disruptions and damages related to security breaches. Any disruption caused by failings in our information technology
infrastructure or underlying equipment or of communication networks could delay or otherwise impact our day-to-day
business and decision-making processes and negatively impact our performance. Failure of our IT infrastructure or
key IT systems could lead to loss of earnings, regulatory fines, limit our ability to operate effectively and have a
negative impact on our reputation.

We currently rely on Walmart for a material portion of our technology services and will continue to depend
on Walmart to maintain and develop IT systems for our use during the term of the TSA. If we are unable to transition
from the Walmart IT system onto a suitable replacement system, it could result in a material disruption to our business.
See also “Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions—Delays in our ability to separate from Walmart could result in
_significant cost and any issues with the separation process, particularly related to our transition to a new IT system,_
_could significantly disrupt business operations and impact our ability to meet our strategic objectives” and “Certain_
_Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart.” We are undergoing a_
separation programme, Project Future, to transition the Group to a standalone, leading edge IT infrastructure which
will enable it to improve operating efficiencies, make better use of data, improve its experience for customers and
colleagues, and enable the business to be more agile in responding to customers’ needs. There is a high degree of
complexity in connection with the implementation of the IR system and we may not be able to successfully transition
these systems to our standalone operations in a timely manner, or at all, or may have underestimated the costs required
to do so. There can be no assurance that there will not be errors, delays, payroll transition issues, or other related issues
resulting from the transition to a standalone company and adjustments to associated business processes or that we will
be able to fix any error or issue.

We also depend on other third parties to maintain and develop our IT systems. If such providers were to
terminate their agreements with us or stop providing services to us for any reason, or if such providers were to

58


-----

considerably raise the price of their services, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Some of these
providers are small companies and their long-term financial viability cannot be assured. We cannot guarantee you that
we will be able to find and retain alternative providers or acquire the rights to intellectual property important to our
operations if our current or future providers become financially unstable. To the extent any of these systems,
technologies or programmes do not function properly and we cannot find and retain a suitable IT provider to help
remedy the fault, we may experience material adverse effects on our business that require substantial additional
investments to remedy, or which we may not be able to remedy at all. The performance of the IT systems that we use
depends on, among other things, our ability to effectively safeguard such IT systems and related equipment against
damage or compromise from interruptions to telecommunication services, data breaches, hacking and phishing
attempts and the introduction of malware and computer viruses.

Delays or interruptions in the delivery of our products could result from unknown data, software or hardware
defects, insufficient capacity or the failure of our website hosting, mobile applications and telecommunications
vendors to provide continuous and uninterrupted service. Any significant breakdown of plant or equipment, accidents,
such as a serious flood, fire and other natural disasters, or other significant disruption to the operations of our primary
sites for all of our computer and communications systems could significantly affect our ability to manage our
information technology systems. Our equipment and technology systems also require ongoing maintenance,
refinement, updating and may also require replacement with more advanced equipment or systems in the future. If we
are unable to maintain more advanced equipment or systems in the future or upgrade our IT system regularly, we may
experience difficulties with the adoption of new technology and systems into our existing operations. Furthermore,
disruptions to operations or interruptions in operations involving such systems may occur in the future. Any material
disruption or slowdown of our equipment or technology systems, including those caused by our failure to successfully
upgrade our equipment or systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. We cannot assure protection against unauthorised attempts to access the IT systems that we use,
including malicious third-party applications that may interfere with or exploit security flaws in our products and
services.

We rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security necessary to effect the secure
transmission of information from our customers, such as credit or debit card numbers (although as part of our Payment
Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI-DSS”) compliance we do not store this data but use third-party payment
providers). At the same time, we increasingly rely on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third
parties holding significant amounts of Asda and customer information on our behalf. We cannot guarantee absolute
protection against unauthorised attempts to access our or these third parties’ IT systems, including third party
applications that may interfere with or exploit security flaws in our or these third parties’ products and services.
Viruses, worms and other malicious software programmes could, among other things, jeopardise the security of
information stored in a user’s computer or in our or these third parties’ computer systems, affect the availability of
our or these third parties’ computer systems or attempt to change the internet experience of users by interfering with
our ability to connect with users. In addition, in the past, we have also experienced system intrusion attempts through
non-cyber means, including through fraudulent phone calls. We have seen an increase over the past several years in
the frequency and sophistication of attempts to compromise the security of the types of IT and other systems we use.
If any compromise in our security measures, or those of the third parties we rely on (including our suppliers) were to
occur and our, or their, efforts to combat such a breach are unsuccessful, our reputation may be harmed leading to a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.

Any failure of such IT systems due to a technical issue or a cyberattack, and any failure of our IT systems’
support teams to mitigate such IT system failures, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and
assets. For example, any such failure could impact on the availability of electronic point of sale (EPOS) systems and
therefore limit our ability to complete sales. Moreover, a failure that causes our websites to become unavailable could
materially adversely affect online product viewing opportunities and sales. If any compromise in our security measures
were to occur and our efforts to combat such a breach were unsuccessful, our operations would be interrupted and our
reputation could be harmed, leading to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Our use of open-source software may restrict our ability to exploit our proprietary software and IT systems and_**
**_exposes us to certain risks._**

Our key proprietary software and critical IT systems incorporate significant elements of “open source”
software, our use of which is subject to the terms of applicable licences. Open-source software is typically licensed
for use at no initial charge on terms which allow modification and distribution of the software by the licensee.
However, licence terms may impose on the user compliance requirements and obligations to disclose modifications
we have made to the software to third parties. Our ability to realise fully the commercial benefits of any such software
may be restricted because:

    - Open-source licences may be drafted in legally ambiguous language and may result in unanticipated
consequences or obligations regarding our software;

    - due to the requirements to licence modified software, our competitors or licensees may have access to
information which may help them to develop competitive products;

    - open-source software is available to the public for anyone to access and utilise, including our
competitors; and

    - it may be difficult for us to identify accurately the developers of the open-source code (who may be
licensors of the software) and whether the licensed software infringes third party intellectual property
rights.

Furthermore, to the extent we use open-source software we face certain more general risks which apply to
any organisation making use of such software. Our use of GNU General Public Licence (“GPL”) software could
subject certain portions of our proprietary software to GPL requirements, including an obligation on us to disclose
that software to third parties and to permit them to use the software free of charge. Finally, open-source licences
typically present onerous compliance requirements and failure to observe these may result in litigation or the loss of
the right to use the software which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and future prospects.
Although we are not aware that we have breached any of these compliance requirements, and to our knowledge no
third party has claimed that software owned by us should be made available on an open-source basis, any of the risks
or restrictions relating to open-source software mentioned above could have an adverse impact on our financial
condition and future prospects.

**_If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us in stores and online do not_**
**_function effectively, our results of operations, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel business, could be_**
**_materially adversely affected._**

Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our
competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use our websites, social media, online advertising, and email
campaigns to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our
omni-channel strategy, we offer home delivery and pickup options under which many products available for purchase
online can be picked up in-store by the customer via our Click & Collect offer and our Scan&Go service that allows
customers to use a handset or the Scan&Go mobile app to scan and bag items as they shop and utilise a dedicated
checkout area for quick and easy payment, in each case providing additional customer traffic at such stores. In 2022,
we also implemented a new loyalty programme, Asda Rewards, which is an app-based system whereby customers
earn cash back on their shopping, building Asda Pounds in their cash pots to spend in store and online, and earn
additional discounts on certain products.

Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the UK retail grocery industry. We must anticipate and
meet our customers’ changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our
competitors’ operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all
channels. Any failure on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide
assortment of merchandise at competitive prices and with low-cost and rapid delivery options and that continually
meet the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform merchandising
and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of online and other sales, harm

our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our online business and have a material
adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

**_We may suffer a loss as a result of operational risk, including human error, ineffective or inadequate designed_**
**_processes, failure of IT or other systems, improper conduct by colleagues and third parties, failures by suppliers_**
**_and third-party providers and criminal activity including fraud, theft and cybercrime._**

Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business, customers, and colleagues,
whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could damage our reputation,
result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial additional costs, and materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to the risk of theft or misappropriation of funds and
products and to the risk of fraud and corruption in our stores and warehouses, as well as human error. For example,
from time to time, products may be misappropriated during transportation, or we may experience a misappropriation
of funds or goods in our stores or at other levels of our business. We cannot assure that incidences of inventory loss
and theft will not increase further in the future, that insurance will cover such losses adequately or that the measures
we are taking against such theft will effectively decrease inventory shrinkage. In addition to increasing security costs
to combat inventory theft, the occurrence of such risks may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations
and reputation.

**_Use of social media may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties._**

There has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices, including blogs,
social media websites and other forms of internet-based communications which allow individual access to a broad
audience of customers and other interested persons. Consumers value readily available information concerning
retailers, manufacturers and their goods and services and often act on such information without further investigation,
authentication and without regard to its accuracy. The availability of information on social media platforms and
devices is virtually immediate as is its impact. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content
their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The
opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is virtually limitless. Information
concerning or affecting us may be posted on such platforms and devices at any time. Information posted may be
inaccurate and adverse to us, and it may harm our business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an
opportunity for redress or correction. Such platforms also could be used for the dissemination of trade secret
information or compromise of other valuable company assets, any of which could harm our business.

We also use social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain TikTok, Instagram,
Facebook and Twitter accounts. In addition, we may from time-to-time partner with celebrities, influencers and other
third parties across various social media platforms, but there can be no assurance that these campaigns will be
successful or that their values align with Asda’s values and therefore our association with such parties may negatively
affect or harm our reputation. Furthermore, other social media users with whom we do not have partnerships or control
over may use their accounts and following based on these social media platforms to criticise Asda with subjective or
false, or without basis, which may in turn adversely impact our reputation. See also “—Any events that negatively
_impact the reputation of, or value associated with, our brands could materially adversely affect our business, financial_
_condition and results of operations.”_

As laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us,
our colleagues or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these
platforms and devices could adversely impact our business or subject us to fines or other penalties.

**_We rent certain of our properties pursuant to commercial leases that may be subject to adjustments that could_**
**_increase expenses and have a materially adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

Certain of our stores and warehouses are leased pursuant to commercial leases for fixed terms consistent with
market practice. Such leases usually provide for regular rent reviews, at which time our rental costs may increase in
line with certain indices or in line with the open market rent. Our ability to maintain our existing rental rates during

61


-----

renewals or to renew any expired lease on favourable terms will depend on many factors which are not within our
control, such as applicable real estate laws and regulations, payments for utilities, local taxes or assessments,
conditions in the local real estate market, competition for desirable properties and our relationships with current and
prospective landlords. If rent reviews were to increase at higher rates than currently anticipated or if we were unable
to renew any expired leases on commercially favourable terms, our financial performance could be adversely
impacted.

Further, we may be unable to extend expiring lease agreements at all or may have no or limited ability to
close certain store locations that do not meet our financial targets or are no longer consistent with our brands’
positioning. These changes in the size of our store network can have a significant impact on our revenues and expenses
from one period to the next, which affect the comparability of our results during these periods. Our ability to enter
into leases to open new retail locations depends on the availability of locations that meet our criteria for traffic, square
footage, lease economics, demographics and other factors. In addition, the market for suitable retail locations is highly
competitive. Some of our competitors may have the ability to negotiate more favourable commercial lease terms than
we can. The above risks are also applicable to (i) the leases of the Warehouse Assets pursuant to the 2021 Sale and
Leaseback Transactions, (ii) the leases of the SLB Properties pursuant to the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions
and (iii) the leases of the CGR Properties pursuant to the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction.

Any breach that we commit under our lease agreements and do not remedy in line with the relevant forfeiture
provisions may lead to forfeiture of the relevant lease by the landlord, subject to our ability to seek relief from
forfeiture (except in respect of lease agreements for stores located in Scotland where no such relief process applies)
from the courts (any such relief being at the discretion of the courts). Forfeiture of the leases would result in the loss
of our right to occupy the property and may entail material interruption to the business and operations of the Group.
In addition, a breach of any Ground Lease may entitle the lender under the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction to accelerate
the Ground Rent Transaction Facility Agreement and enforce security over all properties secured under the 2023
Ground Rent Transaction resulting in the loss of ownership of the freehold and long leases properties comprising the
2023 Ground Rent Transaction.

If we are unable to renew our lease agreements as they expire or if any of our existing lease agreements are
terminated for any reason and we are unable to secure other favourable locations on acceptable terms, this could have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also “Risks Relating to
_Financial, Reporting, and Other Matters—We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates_
_made or procedures followed in the third-party valuation report of our portfolio of real estate assets are correct,_
_accurate or complete” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”_

The Group’s leases of the Warehouse Assets and SLB Properties and the Ground Leases are leases for terms
of at least 25 years. If the Group needs to exit a lease of a Warehouse Assets or SLB Property, it will need to assign
or underlet the lease and must meet the criteria set out in the relevant leases to effect a disposition. In a depressed
market or if there is no demand for a property, the Group may not be able to exit that property in a cost-efficient
manner, or at all. In terms of the Ground Leases, the tenant is not permitted to assign so in order to exit the property
the tenant may seek to underlet the property (subject to the restrictions contained in the Ground Leases); the
implication of this is that on such an underletting the tenant remains liable for any non-performance of the tenant
covenants in the relevant lease by the undertenant.

**_A significant disruption in our workforce or the workforce of our suppliers or a failure to extend, renew or_**
**_renegotiate trade union agreements could lead to labour disputes that might interfere with our operations or_**
**_otherwise could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

As of December 31, 2023, we employed 148,771 colleagues, with 98,284 full-time employees. 126,541 of
these colleagues worked in our store network and 13,139 worked in our distribution network. From time to time, we
may experience labour disputes and we can never rule out the possibility of work stoppages. We are also exposed to
similar risks involving the workforce of our third-party suppliers, including all of our distribution centre operators. In
particular, a labour stoppage or other interruption at one of our suppliers or distribution centres would impact our
ability to supply our stores or online orders and could have a pronounced effect on our operations as a result. As we
do not directly control our suppliers, we have limited information on labour relations between our suppliers and their
workforces.

62


-----

In addition, some of our colleagues are members of trade unions and are parties to collective bargaining
agreements, which contain provisions covering issues such as working hours and compensation. See “Business—Our
_Colleagues.” We may not be able to extend existing agreements, renew them on their current terms or, negotiate such_
agreements in a favourable and timely manner or without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions, any of
which may have a material adverse effect on our business. If we seek to reduce colleague benefits, or otherwise are
unable to maintain satisfactory colleague and labour relations, the results could include work stoppages, strikes or
other industrial action or labour difficulties (including higher labour costs), any of which could materially adversely
affect our operations. As a result, any deterioration in our relationships with our colleagues, unions and other colleague
representatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For
example, we experienced a 48-hour industrial strike at our Gosport superstore starting on February 10, 2024 and at
our Wisbech superstore starting on March 29, 2024 and we expect there to be a similar strike at our Lowestoft
superstore starting on May 10, 2024. These strikes are initiated by the General, Municipal, Boilermakers’ and Allied
Trade Union (the “GMB”), following negotiations over work-culture concerns. GMB members have begun preparing
industrial action ballots at our Brighton Marina and Brighton Hollingbury stores. As of the date of this Offering
Memorandum, we have not received the notice outlining any of these industrial strikes’ dates. We have been and, in
the future, may again be subject to additional industrial action ballots at different stores, and negotiations with trade
unions cannot ensure the avoidance of strikes or work stoppages.

From time to time, disagreements and other disputes may emerge with our workforce and/or their
representatives and we are presently engaged in ordinary course litigation regarding dismissals, overtime work and
other routine disputes or actions. See “Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation.”

We cannot assure you that a future labour disturbance, work stoppage, or failure to attract and retain operative
personnel at any of our stores, depots or our suppliers’ facilities in the United Kingdom or elsewhere would not have
a material adverse effect on such store’s or facility’s operations and, potentially, on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

**_Our failure to attract and retain qualified colleagues, increases in labour costs and social charges and other_**
**_changes to wage regulations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

We are reliant on our staff for the management, operation, creation, maintenance, repair and upgrading of
our business, operations and systems. Our ability to recruit or adequately replace, retain and motivate suitably qualified
and experienced staff is important for our ongoing success. It may in the future become more difficult for us to recruit
or retain such members of staff with the relevant skillset, retain key colleagues, or adapt colleague skillsets to align
with transformation activities, which could lead to a negative impact on operational performance, a delay in separation
transformation and ultimately impact our external reputation. Moreover, the UK labour market may become more
competitive. An inability to recruit and retain sufficient personnel of the right calibre or the incurring of significant
costs in order to do so may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and future prospects. Furthermore, our
automated warehouses and delivery trucks still require intensive labour. Colleague benefits (which include wages,
National Insurance contributions and other payments) currently represent one of our most significant cost items,
accounting for a substantial portion of our total expenses. Consequently, our commercial success depends in part on
our ability to manage our labour costs and control their impact on our margins. We may in the future be forced to raise
our wages due to changes in market conditions, new labour laws and regulations, collective bargaining with our
recognised trade unions or general wage increases across the industry or in any particular region in which we operate.
For example, in April 2023, we voluntarily increased our rate for hourly-paid store colleagues to £11.00 an hour and
further increased this in July 2023 to £11.11 an hour. For stores inside the M25 and around Greater London, our rate
for hourly-paid store colleagues increased to £12.28 an hour. The national minimum wage is due to increase to £11.44
an hour in April 2024, and we plan to give our colleagues an interim increase, with those inside the M25 and around
Greater London receiving £12.61 an hour. In July 2024, we are proposing a further increase in pay to 120,000 of our
colleagues which will increase the basic pay for retail workers to £12.04 an hour, with those at stores inside the M25
and around Greater London receiving £13.21 an hour. Overall, this is an 8.4% increase in pay from £11.11 in July
2023 to the proposed £12.04 in July 2024.

Additionally, we compete with other producers for dependable employees. The supply of such employees is
limited and competition to hire and retain them may result in higher labour costs, for example as a result of higher
wages implemented in response to inflationary pressure and cost of living increases. Furthermore, a number of our

63


-----

employees are subject to national minimum wage requirements. Given the high proportion of our colleagues who are
paid hourly, future increases or changes to the National Minimum Wage legislation, the National Living Wage or
other hourly wage legislation or regulations could have an impact on our future financial success. As of April 2023,
the National Living Wage increased from £9.50 per hour as of April 2022 to £10.42 per hour. The National Living
Wage will increase in increments with a target to be set by the UK government of reaching £11.44 by April 2024. We
must comply with such legislation. Any failure to comply could result in criminal prosecution with any party found
to be guilty of deliberate non-compliance being subject to disqualification as a company director for up to 15 years.
From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings in connection with the wages we pay. See “Business—Legal
_Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation.” If legislation is enacted that has the effect of raising national minimum wage_
requirements, requires additional mandatory employee benefits or affects our ability to hire or dismiss employees, we
could face substantially higher labour costs. Increases in labour costs could adversely affect our profitability if we are
not able to pass them on to our customers.

As national minimum hourly wage rates increase, we may be required to increase not only the wage rates of
our hourly paid colleagues but also the wages of our salaried managers as an increase in hourly rates inevitably erodes
the pay gap between hourly paid and first line managers. This makes it more challenging to incentivise our most
talented colleagues to progress into management positions. It also makes it difficult to retain our talented managers.
Although difficult to predict with certainty, these higher salaried costs could have a material adverse effect on our
profitability. While we cannot be certain how this will affect our business, an increase in the minimum wage rate paid
to certain workers will increase our labour costs which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial
condition.

Our ability to meet our management labour needs, while controlling wage and labour-related costs, is subject
to numerous external factors, including the availability of and competition for qualified persons in the local markets
in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing pay rates, changing demographics,
and changes in employment and labour laws. Such laws related to hours, wages, job classification and benefits could
significantly increase operating costs.

If we fail to maintain our competitive position on pay and benefits, the quality of our workforce could decline,
causing our customer service to suffer, while increasing wages for our colleagues could cause our profit margins to
decrease. If we are unable to hire, retain, and train colleagues capable of meeting our business needs and expectations,
our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in
turnover rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects.

Furthermore, we are required to pay social security, National Insurance contributions, pension contributions
and other similar charges for our colleagues. These may increase over time or the laws and regulations setting forth
any exonerations or other exemptions from payment of such charges from which we currently benefit may change,
increasing our liabilities.

We maintain a defined contribution pension plan that covers current and former colleagues pursuant to which
the employer, employee or both make contributions on a regular basis to such plans. See “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—_
_Asda Group Pension Scheme Buy-In.” Any of the foregoing may affect our profitability and may have a material_
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to pass on such higher
costs to our customers, these higher labour costs could materially adversely affect our profitability.

**_Our intellectual property rights may be infringed or challenged. Intellectual property claims by third parties or our_**
**_failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our_**
**_competitive position._**

We own or use a variety of trade names, logos, domain names, service marks and trademarks in our business
and rely on trademark and copyright laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our
intellectual proprietary rights. We may not have adequate protections for our intellectual property rights or may be
accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. We cannot be certain that third parties will not
infringe, misappropriate or terminate these rights. With the exception of the George brand, we own nearly all the
intellectual property rights over the trademarks, trade signs and copyrights that we use. We also own some of the
intellectual property rights over the software and technologies that we use. However, such use may be challenged by

64


-----

third parties. If we are unable to protect and maintain our own intellectual property rights or our use of the intellectual
property rights owned by others, or we are unable to renew our intellectual property rights when they expire, the value
of our brands could be diminished, and our competitive position could weaken.

We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorised use of our proprietary rights.
Third parties that licence our proprietary rights may also take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights
or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of financial and managerial
resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or
prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others
will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property
rights.

In addition, our products, services, websites or acts conducted in the ordinary course of our business may
violate, or be perceived to violate, intellectual property rights of third parties (in particular, copyrights, trademarks,
design rights, patents and software) and we may be subject to infringement claims. We may also be involved in claims
raised by third parties against our suppliers. For example, we may be involved in claims regarding products or services
supplied by our suppliers that are perceived as infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.

Third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us as we expand our business to include new
services and continue to develop our online channel. We may also face claims from our suppliers if they consider that
their intellectual property rights are being misused, especially where those suppliers have a strong brand image and
reputation. Our defence of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming, and could divert
management resources. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability and
prevent us from selling some of our products and/or services. In addition, the resolution of claims may require us to
abandon the sale or provision of the litigious product or service, redesign our own private-label products or acquire
licence rights from third parties, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations
and financial condition.

**_Robbery, shop crime and fraud in our stores may adversely affect us._**

We, like other grocers, have increasingly become the target of robberies, burglaries and theft across our
stores. We have witnessed the rate of such crimes increase (in volume and frequency) recently, which may be linked
to the continuing cost of living crisis in the United Kingdom. We and are our personnel are exposed to safety threats
such as theft, assault or destruction of property. Higher crime rates throughout the United Kingdom could negatively
our sales and operations. Despite our efforts to reduce our exposure to such crimes, for instance through security
guards or security cameras on our sites, we expect to continue to be exposed to such crimes and new forms of crime.
There can be no assurance that our current or future efforts to counteract crimes will be effective or that the cost of
such efforts will not increase. In addition, we have been the target of other forms of crime such as, fraud and
embezzlement by our colleagues. Any crime we become victim of may give rise to litigation and related costs,
including reputational costs and the costs linked to the diversion of the attention from our management team from
day-to-day operations of our business. A single significant incident of fraud, or increases in the overall level of fraud,
may be sufficient to result in significant reputational damage to us or could lead to the imposition of regulatory
sanctions. Our inability to control and reduce robberies, whether intentional or not, burglaries, fraud, embezzlement
or other forms of crime in a cost-effective manner could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial
condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.

**_Certain activities of our business are seasonal or cyclical in nature, and our revenue, working capital requirements_**
**_and results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter as a result._**

Our sales, profits, working capital requirements and cash flows within any given year have historically been
affected by seasonal fluctuations. For example, sales volumes have historically been higher in the run-up to the
Christmas and Easter holidays and historically lower in February. In addition, sales of certain of our products have
historically been higher during the summer tourist season. These seasonal influences have a direct impact on our
earnings, and fluctuations in our inventory or store closings during these peak periods could affect our working capital
requirements. If seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated, there could be a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate
significantly as a result of other factors, including the timing of new store openings, temporary or definitive closings

65


-----

or disposals, and the revenue contributed by new stores or the loss of revenue from closed or sold stores. For these
reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons may not be a good indication of our performance or how we may perform
in the future. For a further discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business, see “Management’s Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—_
_Seasonality of Our Results of Operations.”_

**_We are exposed to payments risks, including processing risks, increases in transaction fees, actions taken by third_**
**_parties that could disrupt our operations, failure by us or third parties on whom we rely to fully comply with rules_**
**_and standards governing payment processing, and system failures and security breaches._**

We are reliant on electronic payment methods. We accept payments using credit and debit cards, gift cards,
contactless, PayPal, Android Pay and Apple Pay. As we offer new payment options to customers, we and our
customers may be increasingly exposed to fraud (although fraud is not currently a significant concern). For existing
and future payment options we offer our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance
requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant
costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products). We pay interchange and other fees for these card payments,
which may increase over time and raise operating costs and lower margins. Interchange fees on Visa and MasterCard
are regulated and are therefore currently subject to an effective minimum amount, which is beyond our control.
Interchange fees on American Express payments are negotiated with American Express on an arm’s-length basis. We
rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, and it could disrupt our operations if these companies
become unwilling or unable to provide these services. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules,
certification requirements, PCI-DSS and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be
reinterpreted, making them difficult or impossible to comply with. If we fail to comply with these rules or
requirements, we may be subject to fines and/or higher transaction fees and, in extreme cases, may lose our ability to
accept payments from customers, process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments. See
also “—We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarise results and manage our
_business. These systems are interdependent and disruptions in the IT infrastructure that we use could materially_
_adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”_

Any failure of our payment processing systems, whether caused by a systems failure or otherwise, will
adversely affect our income in the short-term and may result in us losing customers which may have a material adverse
effect on our financial condition and prospects. In addition, there can be no assurance that advances in computer
capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments will not result in a
compromise or breach of the processes we use to protect customer transaction data. If any such compromise or breach
were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, prospects, financial condition and
results of operations.

In certain circumstances, our contract with our payment card acquirer and American Express generally
require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if
information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised. In such
cases, resulting liabilities could be substantial.

**_We may from time to time pursue acquisitions, which may prove more costly than anticipated and may not generate_**
**_anticipated synergies and which may have an adverse impact on our business, as could our failure to successfully_**
**_integrate such businesses following acquisition. Our business could also be negatively impacted by merger control_**
**_rules and antitrust limitations imposed by supranational and national laws and regulations._**

We have in the past acquired and may in the future from time to time acquire other companies or businesses.
Pursuing future acquisitions depends on, among other things, identifying suitable acquisition or investment
opportunities and successfully completing those transactions. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could
harm our business, including difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel
of an acquired company; difficulties in supporting and transitioning vendors, if any, of an acquired company; diversion
of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities; failure to
realise the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction; failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other
shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property,
regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or colleague or customer issues;
risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience; potential loss of key colleagues, customers

66


-----

and suppliers from either our current business or an acquired company’s business; inability to generate sufficient
revenue to offset acquisition costs; additional costs associated with funding the acquisition; and possible write-offs or
impairment charges relating to acquired businesses. Furthermore, acquisitions of businesses outside of our markets
may present additional challenges due to cultural and linguistic differences and the difficulties presented by integrating
and managing a business that is geographically more remote. Our ability to integrate and manage acquired businesses
effectively and to handle any future growth will depend upon a number of factors, and failure to manage growth
effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also “—
_Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions—We may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses we have recently_
_acquired into our business.”_

In addition, the growth of our business to date, and our future growth, has placed and is expected to continue
to place significant demands on our management and operational and financial infrastructure. Managing growth has
in the past and will in the future continue to require significant expenditure and allocation of management resources,
as well as an expansion in headcount. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency as we continue to grow,
there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also “—We
_depend on the services of our senior management team, and our business and growth strategy could be materially_
_adversely impacted if we were to lose a significant number of members of our senior management and were unable to_
_replace them with executives of equal experience and capabilities.”_

Acquisitions may also increase our indebtedness, both through debt incurred to finance the acquisition and
existing indebtedness of the acquired company, which could make it more difficult to incur additional indebtedness.
Any increase in indebtedness in connection with an acquisition may have a material adverse effect on us. See “—
_Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure and the Senior Secured Notes—We may incur additional debt in the future,_
_which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Senior Secured Notes, and impact our ability to_
_operate our businesses.”_

Moreover, merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by national laws and regulations could
negatively impact our business if such laws and regulations prevent us from expanding our growth through the
consummation of mergers or acquisitions in certain categories or oblige us to divest certain stores or activities that
may have an impact on our market shares in some geographical areas. For example, in order to address competitive
concerns raised by the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”), we agreed to divest 13 sites in connection with
the Arthur Acquisition. At the same time, if smaller players in our markets are able to consolidate, this could increase
the competitive pressure on our business due to an increase in such competitors’ economies of scale and a reduction
in their operating costs. Moreover, our competitors might acquire smaller players in our markets, further strengthening
their position in the market. These events could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations to be
materially and adversely affected. See “—We are susceptible to claims of anti-competitive practices.”

**_We are susceptible to claims of anti-competitive practices._**

Part of our overall strategy is to be a leader in our business sectors. We may be accused of anti-competitive
practices based on our conduct and taking into account our market position. Any such claims could materially
adversely affect our reputation, potentially result in legal proceedings that could have an impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations and require us to divest assets. Such claims could also impair our ability
to conduct acquisitions accretive to our business. For example, in 2023, we were part of a CMA fuel pricing market
study which resulted in a fine to Asda related to the delayed provision of information. Before certain potential future
acquisitions can be consummated, we may also be required to seek approvals and consents from regulatory agencies
or there may be applicable waiting periods that will need to expire. We may be unable to obtain such regulatory
approvals or consents, or, in order to obtain them, we may be required to dispose of assets or take other actions that
could have the effect of reducing our return on potential future acquisitions. For example, in order to address
competitive concerns raised by the CMA, we agreed to divest 13 sites in connection with the Arthur Acquisition. Even
if regulatory authorities do not require disposals or other actions, the regulatory approval process may have the effect
of delaying our ability to implement potential future acquisitions. See also “—We are subject to extensive, increasingly
_stringent and frequently changing laws and regulations and increased scrutiny from regulators and enforcement_
_authorities, including in relation to advertising, food and product safety, health and safety matters and the_
_environment, and both compliance and non-compliance therewith could impose substantial liabilities and costs and_
_have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_

67


-----

**_A loss of key personnel or of our ability to attract and retain experienced members of management, qualified_**
**_employees and other key personnel could adversely affect our business._**

We rely on our senior management as one of our major competitive strengths. Our success depends, in part,
upon the continued services of our senior management team to operate our business and execute our strategies. Our
senior management’s knowledge of the market, our businesses and our company represent a key strength of our
business model. The success of our business strategy and our future growth also depend on our ability to attract, train,
retain and motivate skilled colleagues, managerial, sales, administration, development and operating personnel. There
can be no assurance that any members of our senior management team will continue to be employed by us or that we
will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. For example, as disclosed in “Recent Developments,”
our shareholders are also involved in active discussions regarding Zuber Issa ceasing to continue as a shareholder of
the Group. We also currently do not have a Chief Executive Officer, which could have an adverse impact on our
business and divert other management attention. The loss of a significant number of members of our senior
management team who are in critical roles, the failure to attract additional key personnel, or the failure to find a
suitable Chief Executive Officer in a timely fashion could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of
operations and financial condition. This could also result in additional duties for the remaining members of senior
management, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Increased criminal sophistication to facilitate human trafficking and modern slavery may lead to our business_**
**_operations being infiltrated and abused more often for the illegal purpose of exploiting vulnerable individuals._**

Because of our dependency on cross-continental goods transport and the type of operations such as food
packaging manufacturing that are well-documented targets for exploitation schemes by criminals, there is a risk that
criminals will continue to attempt to conduct their exploitative schemes undetected within our supply chain or business
operations. We have dealt with occasional incidents of modern slavery and human trafficking in recent years, and we
believe that these criminal acts in general across any business sector in the United Kingdom will continue to exist and
may increase. If we are unable to identify, act and remediate third party criminal acts quickly then, despite not having
acted illegally ourselves, there is a significant risk of negative publicity.

**Risks Relating to Asda Pharmacy and Asda Opticians**

**_Certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services, our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims_**
**_against us and may cause us reputational harm._**

As of December 31, 2023, we operate 247 pharmacies and, as a result, we are exposed to risks inherent in
the packaging, dispensing, distribution and disposal of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such as risks
of liability for products which cause harm to customers, as well as increased regulatory risks and related costs and
reputational risks. We cannot guarantee that the coverage limits under our insurance programmes will be adequate to
protect us against future claims, or that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future, or
at all. Our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be materially adversely affected if in the future
our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or there is an increase in the liability for which we
self-insure, or we suffer harm to our reputation as a result of an error or omission.

We are subject to numerous government regulations. Each of our in-store pharmacies must be registered with
the General Pharmaceutical Council (or the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland).
Additionally, before a registered pharmacy can dispense prescriptions under the National Health Service, it must be
included in the pharmaceutical list relating to a Health and Wellbeing Board Area, maintained by NHS England, NHS
Scotland or NHS Wales and maintained by the Family Practitioner Services in Northern Ireland. In addition,
pharmacies dispensing controlled substances are required to maintain records of sale and supply and report incidents
to the NHS. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we could be in breach of professional
standards and/or NHS terms of service, which could lead to a hierarchy of penalties up to and including the loss of
such pharmacy’s registration. Each pharmacy therefore has a responsible pharmacist to ensure it operates in a safe and
legal manner and corporate-wide this responsibility is shared by the Superintendent Pharmacist.

Application of laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or
illegality or could require us to make changes to our operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact of future

68


-----

legislation and regulatory changes on our pharmacy business or assure that we will be able to obtain or maintain the
regulatory approvals required to operate our business.

**_Changes in results of our pharmacy business could materially adversely affect overall results._**

A majority of our retail pharmacy revenue is generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive payment
from the NHS. We also generate revenue through providing NHS services, private services and the sale of
over-the-counter medicines that can only be sold from a registered pharmacy by a pharmacist or a person acting under
the supervision of a pharmacist.

Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: changes in availability, pricing, and
safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell, changes in NHS reimbursement for prescription drugs;
a reduction in the pharmacy global sum leading to reduced retained purchase margins available for pharmacy in
England; a reduction in dispensing activity payments; the introduction of new NHS services; and a move away from
reimbursement for dispensing prescription drugs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations,
including online; overall economic conditions; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy
industry and the pharmaceutical industry, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail
pharmacy business.

If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any
reason, we would in turn have to seek a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals, with related risks of shortages or
delays in our own pharmacy operations. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a number
of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies. One or a combination of such factors
may adversely affect the volumes of prescriptions we dispense, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy
operations, and the revenue and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store selling
opportunities and, in turn, affect our overall revenue, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

**_Certain risks are inherent in providing optometry services, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover any_**
**_claims against us._**

As of December 31, 2023, we operate Opticians in 157 stores and in all four nations of the United Kingdom.
We also have an online site supplying powered contact lenses under the “general direction” of a registered optometrist,
suitably qualified dispensing optician or medical practitioner. The majority of our revenue is from the sale of
spectacles and eye examinations.

We are regulated by the General Optical Council (“GOC”). To operate in the United Kingdom and use the
title “Opticians” we have to be registered as a Body Corporate with the GOC and therefore are subject to the GOC
Business Standards as well as the Opticians Act 1989. It is a requirement of the GOC that any Body Corporates which
do not have GOC registrants as the majority of their Board, must have a Responsible Officer (Superintendent
Optometrist) in position. All Optometrists and Opticians also have to be registered with the GOC to be able to practice
and they are subject to the GOC Professional Standards as well as the Opticians Act 1989. Breaches to the GOC
standards could lead to warnings, fines, sanctions on practice up to being removed from the GOC register either as a
business or individual and unable to practice.

All of our optical departments also hold a contract with the NHS Integrated Care Boards or Health Board to
be able to provide NHS services. Breaches of the terms within such contracts can lead to penalties, including up to
revoking such contract and stopping us providing NHS services. These penalties can occur at the store level, regional
level or national level. Since 78% of our eye examinations were funded by the NHS in 2023, any penalties or stoppage
in NHS services would have a material adverse impact on our business.

Our Optometrists in all four nations also have to be registered on an NHS performer’s listing to be able to
provide NHS eye examinations. In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, some of our stores also conduct additional
NHS services which are commissioned at a local level, which requires such stores to abide by additional NHS standard
contracts with local service level agreements. In Wales, Optometrists also need to have Wales Eye Care Services
(WECS) accreditation and completed Wales General Ophthalmic Services (WGOS) training to be registered as a
performer on the NHS performers list.

69


-----

Changes in the regulatory environment for the optical industry and other changes in laws, rules, NHS contract
terms and regulations may also have an effect on our operating and commercial model.

The provision of professional eye care services entails an inherent risk of professional malpractice and other
similar claims. We may become subject to professional malpractice regulatory or NHS actions or claims under various
theories relating to the professional services provided by our departments. This could also lead to a public relations
and/or reputational risk both at the local and national level. We may not be able to continue to obtain adequate liability
insurance at reasonable rates, in which event, the cost could require us to exit this offering, as insurance is a regulatory
requirement for both a Body Corporate and individual registrants. Furthermore, our insurance may not be adequate to
cover claims asserted against us, thus, potentially decreasing our future cash position.

If the glazing supply provided by our main Optical vendor was to be disrupted for any reason, our Optical
operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could transfer to a new glazing manufacturer. Any
such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a number of our Optical customers transferring their
purchases to other Opticians. This may adversely affect the volumes of glasses we dispense, our cost of sales
associated with our Optical operations, and the revenue and gross margin of those operations.

**Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters**

**_From time to time we and/or our management are subject to claims that can result in litigation, arbitration, tax or_**
**_regulatory proceedings which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant_**
**_liability._**

We may be subject to legal and regulatory enquiries or investigations, both civil and criminal, that could
divert management time and resources and result in fines, taxes, sanctions, variation or revocation of permissions and
authorisations, as well as reputational damage. For example, from time to time, we and/or our management are
involved in litigation, tax audits, claims and other proceedings related to the conduct of our business, including, but
not limited to, claims from our current and former employees, claims of intellectual property infringement, claims
from customers (such as for injuries at our premises), claims asserting unfair competition and unfair business practices
by third parties and environmental, health and safety claims (including, for example, related to the presence of asbestos
in any of our properties). We could face a wide variety of employee claims, including general discrimination, privacy,
labour and employment and disability claims.

For example, Asda Stores Limited has been served with approximately 52,923 employment tribunal claims
(the “Equal Value Claims”) that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester
(the “Employment Tribunal”) in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and
further claims may be asserted in the future. There are also 8,147 claims filed in the High Court which are stayed
pending the outcome of the Equal Value Claims. The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda’s
retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees
working in Asda’s warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions
disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and
distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential
back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective
basis.

In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could
compare their positions in Asda’s retail stores with those of employees in Asda’s warehouse and distribution facilities.
On March 26, 2021, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, that the work of hourly-paid workers
in distribution centres and the work of hourly-paid workers in stores can be compared.

The litigation is currently in the equal value stage when the Employment Tribunal Claimants are proceeding
in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal
value to the work performed by employees in Asda’s warehouse and distribution facilities. The equal value hearing is
scheduled to take place from September 9, 2024 to December 13, 2024 at the Manchester Employment Tribunal.

At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate
any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance as to the

70


-----

scope and outcomes of these matters and any losses that may arise from these proceedings could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See “Business—Legal
_Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation.”_

Any claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory proceedings being brought
against us by various governmental agencies. Often these cases raise complex factual, accounting and legal issues,
which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time and legal expenses.
Litigation and claims and regulatory proceedings against us or our management could result in unexpected expenses
and liability and could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even
if we were successful in defending such proceedings, we could still suffer from the distraction of management
resources to such proceedings, incur certain expenses and possibly face harm to our reputation from case-related
publicity. The involvement in litigation and arbitration proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.”

**_We are subject to extensive, increasingly stringent and frequently changing laws and regulations and increased_**
**_scrutiny from regulators and enforcement authorities, including in relation to advertising, food and product safety,_**
**_health and safety matters and the environment, and both compliance and non-compliance therewith could impose_**
**_substantial liabilities and costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results_**
**_of operations._**

In the ordinary course of our business, our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent laws
and regulations relating to, among other things, labour, competition, imports and exports, advertising, customer
protection, alcohol and tobacco licencing, supplier relations, planning approvals for the opening of new stores,
business operations, product safety, intermediation in customer credit and insurance, information technology, store
safety and accessibility and health, safety and environment. Moreover, some of our businesses are subject to specific
regulations, compliance with each of which can be complex and costly or can result in significant cash outflows. These
include compliance with marketing laws and regulations, compliance with pharmaceutical laws and regulations,
compliance with optometry laws and regulations, compliance with e-commerce laws and regulations and compliance
with real estate laws and regulations. Additionally, we are subject to, among other things: telecommunications
regulation, both directly and indirectly; regulations that govern our relationships with our suppliers, limiting our
operational flexibility; and labour and employment laws that regulate the human resources implications of any
proposals to restructure our business, our colleagues’ working conditions, maximum working hours and, in certain
jurisdictions, the ability to have stores open 24 hours a day or work on Sundays. We may be subject to audits and/or
inquiries into our labour law practices by competent authorities and enforcement costs and penalties can be significant.
Any claims could result in litigation against the Group and could also result in regulatory or legal proceedings and
fines being brought against the Group. For example, in 2023, the CMA fined Asda £60,000 in connection with a
market-wide fuel pricing market study. Often these cases raise complex factual, accounting and legal issues, which
are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time, legal expenses and
exposure to financial penalty. In addition, the CMA introduced the Green Claims Code, and in 2022, launched
investigations into George and other non-Asda apparel brands for eco-friendly and sustainability claims made about
their fashion products, including clothing, footwear, and accessories. For more information see “Business—
_Regulation—Competition and Markets Authority—Green Claims Code,” and “Business—Legal Proceedings—_
_Environmental Claims Matter.”_

We are also subject to the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (“GSCOP”), a statute governing the largest
UK food retailers which requires these retailers to treat their suppliers fairly, lawfully and in good faith. The proposed
fines for breaching the legislation may be up to 1% of the breaching retailer’s turnover. Even if no fines are assessed,
a finding of breach by the Groceries Code Adjudicator responsible for enforcing the GSCOP may cause negative
publicity and damage our image, reputation or brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we are subject to the Groceries Market Investigation
(Controlled Land) Order 2010 (the “Controlled Land Order”), which is legislation administered by the CMA and
designed to limit the ability of large grocery retailers to prevent land being used by their competitors for grocery
retailing in the future.

Prior to the LBO Acquisition, we purchased our electricity on a wholesale basis via a dedicated subsidiary,
which sold the electricity back into Asda. These electricity purchases are regulated by the Office of Gas and Electricity
Markets (“OFGEM”), which is the government regulator for gas and electricity markets in Great Britain. Since

71


-----

March 2021, we have purchased our electricity on a retail basis facilitated through a third-party agent. Therefore, since
the regulations relating to wholesale electricity purchases do not apply to the retail purchases made since March 2021,
we have navigated the process of revoking the electricity supply license with the help of a consultancy firm. This
process has confirmed that we have met of our obligations and we have no liabilities outstanding. In addition, we are
subject to regulation by the Office of Communications (“OFCOM”), an independent regulator and competition
authority for the UK communications industries, which regulates selling practices for mobile telecommunication
services and changes to mobile termination rates, among other things.

The FCA is responsible for the regulation of insurance and customer credit-related activities in the United
Kingdom. Firms carrying on such activities in the United Kingdom must generally be authorised by the FCA with
appropriate permissions, and FCA authorised firms are subject to ongoing regulation and supervision by the FCA. In
connection with distributing the Asda Money suite of white-labelled financial services products, Asda Stores Limited
is authorised by the FCA with limited permission to carry out credit broking, and both Asda Stores Limited and Asda
Financial Services Limited are registered with the FCA as introducer appointed representatives of a number of
third-party insurance and credit product providers. Any failures in or inadequate controls around the customer
introduction process for those regulated financial services products, or any technical deficiencies in the arrangements
with such third-party insurance and credit product providers, could in principle result in regulatory investigations and
related costs and penalties, as well as reputational damage.

Additionally, as a retailer and manufacturer of food products for human consumption, we are subject to
stringent production, packing, health, quality, labelling and distribution standards. Each of our stores and our
suppliers’ facilities may be subject to licencing, reporting requirements and official quality controls by numerous
governmental authorities. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain the necessary licences or approvals could delay
or prevent the development or operation of a given retail location or distribution centre. Our stores and our distribution
centres are subject to regular inspection by authorities for compliance with hygiene regulations applicable to the sale,
storage and manufacturing of foodstuffs and the traceability of genetically modified organisms, meats and other raw
materials. Should any non-compliance with such regulations be discovered during an inspection, authorities may
temporarily shut down the store, distribution centre or facility concerned and/or result in prosecution and the
imposition of a fine for such non-compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

Further, we are subject to various environmental and health and safety requirements, including those
governing discharges to water and air, waste disposal, the clean-up of contaminated sites, product content and labelling
and worker health and safety. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up obligations, fines, penalties and
other criminal and civil sanctions, and third-party claims for personal injury or property damage, as a result of
violations of our liabilities under these requirements. For example, we own and operate service stations, which include
significant storage of petrol, liquified natural gas or other hazardous materials, and many of our sites store fuel for use
in backup generators and, as a result, we are subject to a variety of legislation governing the use, management, storage
and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes and other regulated materials, such as petroleum and petroleum products,
and any environmental impacts from current or historical operations at such locations. Our operations and facilities
also require permits and authorisations under environmental, health and safety requirements, which are subject to
renewal, modification and rescission by issuing authorities. We also may be required to incur substantial capital or
other costs to comply with such requirements or those that are promulgated in the future.

In addition, we could be sued for health problems caused by the use of tobacco products. In fact, various
health related legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacturing, development,
advertising and marketing of cigarettes have been brought against vendors of tobacco products in the United States.
If this trend progressed to the United Kingdom, any unfavourable verdict against us in a health-related suit could
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

From time to time, we may be notified of or otherwise become aware of additional laws and regulations that
governmental organisations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. Compliance with future
requirements could result in substantial costs to us. Failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could subject
us to sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Future
changes in such laws and regulations could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations. The laws and regulations to which we are subject frequently change, which may materially impact our
business operations, and our failure to comply with such laws can result in significant fines and other penalties. See

72


-----

also “Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—We are subject to
_regulations relating to the implementation of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.”_ As a general
matter, legal requirements are subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance
with these requirements or their effect on our operations. Failure to define clear roles and responsibilities or to
regularly communicate with and train our colleagues may result in non-compliance with applicable laws and
regulations. As is the case for other retailers of our size, we may from time to time be subject to inquiries or
investigations from regulatory bodies by local authorities, competition authorities or financial regulators, in the
ordinary course of our business. Such authorities may take the view that we have not conducted or are not conducting
our business fully in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and, consequently, we may be required to make
significant expenditures to defend against allegations of wrongdoing or modify our business practices to comply with
differing interpretations of existing laws and regulations or with future laws and regulations, which may increase our
costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.

For a further discussion of the material regulatory regimes with which we must comply, see “Business—
_Regulation.”_

**_We are subject to regulations relating to the implementation of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European_**
**_Union._**

Since January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom has been trading as an independent country outside of the
European Union following the UK electorate voting in favour of leaving the European Union (commonly referred to
as “Brexit”) in June 2016 and the conclusion of a new trading agreement between the European Union and the United
Kingdom which was entered into in December 2020. This means that new regulations are in place governing the
import and export of goods between the United Kingdom and the European Union from this date which places a
greater cost and administrative burden on us. For example, from April 30, 2024, physical, documentary and identity
checks at the border are scheduled to be required for medium-risk animal products, plants and plant products, such as
chilled and frozen meat, fish, cheese, eggs, dairy products and certain cut flowers and seeds, imported to United
Kingdom from the European Union. There are also additional regulations in place governing tariffs for products of
non-EU origin when they are exported across the border from the United Kingdom to the European Union which also
can place a greater cost and administrative burden on us. The UK government may implement additional regulations
governing trade movement into and out of the United Kingdom which could have a negative impact on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

We are a UK business. The Brexit administration requirements could mean that the United Kingdom will
suffer as a result of losing commercially favourable access to the EU single market, or specific countries in the
European Union, further resulting in a negative impact on the general and economic conditions in the United Kingdom
and the European Union which could in turn have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Additionally, since we operate 18 stores in Northern Ireland, Brexit has had an additional impact on our
business, results of operation and prospects due to new bureaucratic hurdles and the implementation of the Northern
Ireland Retail Movement Scheme on October 1, 2023, which established a new framework for the movement of retail
goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Future changes may occur in regulations that we are required to comply
with as well as amendments to treaties governing but not limited to tax, duties and tariffs, which could adversely
impact our operations and require us to modify our financial and supply arrangements.

**_We collect and process personal data in our daily business, and the leakage of such data may violate law and could_**
**_materially adversely affect our business._**

We are subject to regulations regarding the use of personal data. In the ordinary course of our business, we
collect, process and in some cases store certain personal financial and other information about our customers and
colleagues (some of which may be sensitive, such as information about customers’ dietary preferences or restrictions),
marketing initiatives and the large number of credit and debit transactions we process. For example, we use our Asda
Rewards loyalty programme to leverage data insights about our customers for targeted investment in our business. We
also process sensitive information about our colleagues, including their bank details, union membership and health
status. We must therefore comply with strict data protection, privacy and security laws and regulatory guidance. In
order for our business to function successfully, we must process personal data, including credit and debit card
information in an adequately secure manner. In addition, our online operations depend heavily upon the secure
transmission of confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. We rely on

third-party service providers to process customer payments made using debit cards and credit cards. See also “Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—We are exposed to payments_
_risks, including processing risks, increases in transaction fees, actions taken by third parties that could disrupt our_
_operations, failure by us or third parties on whom we rely to fully comply with rules and standards governing payment_
_processing, and system failures and security breaches.”_

The use and handling of this personal information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws
and regulations at the national and international levels, as well as by certain third-party contracts. The legal and
regulatory frameworks governing the use and handling of personal information are relatively new in our markets and
are still evolving. Any failure or perceived failure by us or any of our third-party service providers to comply with our
policies or with any other privacy related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or
codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations could materially
adversely affect our reputation and brands and may result in claims, fines (including by card merchants), civil or
criminal proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. For example, we are subject to the UK
GDPR which became applicable on January 31, 2020. The UK GDPR is almost identical to the EU GDPR, which
strengthens existing rights, provides for new rights and gives customers and colleagues increased control over their
personal data, including the requirement for data collectors to process and use personal information solely for the
reasons for which they were collected. Laws, such as the UK GDPR, restrict our ability to collect and use personal
information relating to individuals including the use of that information for marketing purposes. We rely on our own
colleagues to maintain our databases and seek to ensure that procedures are in place to ensure compliance (including
that we maintain proper privacy notices). Non-compliance with the UK GDPR could result in a possible fine of up to
either £17.5 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher,
for the most serious infringements. See also “Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our
_General Operations—We may suffer a loss as a result of operational risk, including human error, ineffective or_
_inadequate designed processes, failure of IT or other systems, improper conduct by colleagues and third parties,_
_failures by suppliers and third-party providers and criminal activity including fraud, theft and cybercrime.”_

Moreover, even if we are compliant with such laws and requirements, we may not be able to prevent security
breaches involving customer transaction data. If we or any of our third-party service providers fail to transmit customer
information in a secure manner, if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption
or loss, a cyberattack or a network security incident, or if our colleagues or certain third-parties fail to comply with
data protection laws and regulations (and, as a result, information about our customers and colleagues is obtained by
unauthorised persons or used inappropriately), we may be subject to the aforementioned consequences, all of which
may significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, customer protection and the digital advertising
business are evolving and subject to potentially different interpretations in different jurisdictions. Changes in these
laws and regulations or their interpretations may force us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business
practices and may present challenges to our ability to collect customer data and promote our sites, product offerings
and services through electronic communication.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to significant financial risks if our_**
**_insurance coverage proves to be inadequate._**

We are exposed to risks that are inherent to our business operations and currently maintain insurance we
believe is customary for businesses of our size and type and in the markets in which we operate. For a description of
our material insurance policies, see “Business—Insurance.” Given the number of locations and settings in which our
colleagues provide services and the range of activities our colleagues engage in, we may not always be able to foresee
accurately all activities and situations in order to ensure that they are fully covered by the terms of our insurance
policies and, as a result, we may not be covered by insurance in specific instances. While we seek to maintain
appropriate levels of insurance, not all risks are insured or insurable. As a result, we cannot guarantee our insurance
programmes will be adequate to cover future claims or operating losses incurred as a result of accidents resulting from
fires, explosions, water damage, theft, political unrest, natural events causing damage to our property (buildings,
furniture, equipment, merchandise or computer systems) or following a business interruption at our premises, nor that
we will be able to maintain our insurance programmes on acceptable terms in the future.

74


-----

We typically renew our insurance on an annual basis. In connection with this renewal process, our insurance
costs may increase following the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages, in response
to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general.
The occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages in a calendar year may have a material
adverse effect on our insurance premiums. Furthermore, given a recent change in our credit ratings, our providers
required that we offer additional financial security for a portion of the deductible amounts payable by us under our
policies, which has increased the overall costs of carrying insurance. If we are not able to maintain our current
insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost or if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable
in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.

Our insurance coverage may not cover all risks, and there are some risks that may only be covered to a limited
extent due to limits in our insurance policies. For instance, we may incur losses that cannot be insured against or that
we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and
management estimates underlying our reserves for such losses could result in significantly higher expense than
anticipated, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See
also “Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Asda Pharmacy and Asda Opticians—Certain
_risks are inherent in providing optometry services, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against_
_us”_ and “Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Asda Pharmacy and Asda Opticians—
_Certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims_
_against us and may cause us reputational harm.”_

**_We may be adversely impacted by environmental, social and governance matters, including if we are unable to_**
**_meet goals and commitments that we establish in relation to such matters._**

In recent years, there has been an increased focus from investors, governmental and nongovernmental
entities, and the public on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters, including greenhouse gas
emissions, renewable energy, packaging and waste, practices related to sustainable supply chain, energy and water
use, diversity, equity and inclusion, human rights and social commitment. A variety of organisations evaluate, and
measure the performance of, companies on such ESG matters, and the results of these assessments are widely
publicised. For example, many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores
when making investments and may consider a company’s ESG or sustainability scores as a reputational or other factor
in making an investment decision. If our ESG practices do not meet investor, customer, or employee expectations,
which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation, and customer and employee retention may be negatively impacted.

The execution of our ESG strategies to achieve goals, commitments, and targets are subject to risks and
uncertainties, many of which may be outside of our control and prove to be more costly than we anticipate. These
risks and uncertainties include our ability to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets within the currently projected
costs and the expected timeframes; unforeseen operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research
efforts and future technology developments; and the success of our collaborations with third parties. It is possible that
stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG reporting, our ESG practices or our speed of adoption. We could also
incur additional costs and devote additional resources to monitor, report and implement various ESG practices. Any
failure, or perceived failure, to achieve our ESG goals, commitments, and targets could damage our reputation and
customer, investor and other stakeholder relationships, and may even result in regulatory enforcement action. Such
conditions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “Business—
_Our Quality Control System, Health and Safety and Environmental Policies.”_

**_The international scope of the George Clothing business may subject us to additional legislative, judicial,_**
**_accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions_**
**_in which we sell and deliver products, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial_**
**_performance._**

In addition to our UK operations, George Clothing products are available for sale internationally through a
third-party supplier. Our future results of operations from international sales of the George Clothing products could
be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include stability of
the third-party supplier, political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions, legal
and regulatory constraints (such as direct marketing, regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory
restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on online and retail operations in international markets), restrictive

-----

governmental actions (such as trade protection measures), local product safety and environmental laws, tax rates, laws
and regulations, local labour laws, anti-money laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations,
laws and regulations regarding customer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in
which we operate, now or in the future.

Additionally, following the Separation, pursuant to the TMA, Walmart has granted us a licence to continue
to use the George brand within the United Kingdom (for sale, marketing and distribution purposes on an exclusive
basis) and outside the United Kingdom in certain specified countries in Europe (on a non-exclusive basis) granted us
a licence to use the George brand (on a non-exclusive basis) in certain other territories outside the United Kingdom
and such specified European countries in substantially the same way and to the same extent as the brand was used by
Asda immediately prior to the date of the LBO Acquisition Agreement, as specified in, and subject to the terms of,
the TMA, in each case on and subject to the terms of the TMA. The TMA restricts Asda from using the George brand
(and other Licensed IP (as defined in “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional
_Agreements with Walmart—Trade Mark Agreement”)) following the LBO Acquisition Completion Date other than in_
accordance with the licences granted under the TMA contains certain covenants and undertakings from Asda Stores
Limited, including as regards Asda’s use of the George brand (and other Licensed IP); see “Certain Relationships and
_Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart—Trade Mark Agreement.” As referred to in_
“Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart—Trademark
_Agreement,” Walmart has a right to terminate the TMA under certain circumstances, including for material breach of_
the TMA by Asda or repeated non-material breaches of the TMA by Asda. Asda has also indemnified the Walmart
Group for losses arising out of Asda’s use of the Licensed IP (including the George brand) in material breach of the
TMA. Violating the TMA with Walmart could lead to Walmart exercising its right to terminate the TMA and the
licence to Asda of the George brand, and Asda therefore ceasing to have the right to use the George brand, as well as
to potential claims by Walmart against Asda for breach of the TMA. See also “Risks Relating to Our Business and
_Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—Our intellectual property rights may be infringed or_
_challenged. Intellectual property claims by third parties or our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property_
_rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position.”_

**_We are exposed to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions or other similar regulations._**

We must comply with certain anti-corruption laws or other similar regulations. We operate in certain parts
of the world that lack a developed legal system or have experienced widespread corruption. Under some
circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our internal
policies mandate compliance with these laws, but we cannot ensure that our internal control policies and procedures
will always protect us from acts committed by our associated persons.

Violations of such laws can result in civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions,
interdicts, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, termination of existing contracts, revocations or
restrictions of licences, criminal fines or imprisonment. In addition, such violations could also negatively impact our
reputation and consequently, our ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers. On the other hand,
any such violation by our competitors, if undetected, could give them an unfair competitive advantage. The
consequences that we may suffer due to the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Changes in tax rates or laws, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results._**

We are subject to complex tax laws in the United Kingdom and have historically been subject to international
tax laws in connection with international sales of the George Clothing and George Home products. Changes in (or
changes in interpretations of) tax treaties, tax laws or regulations or tax authority guidance could materially adversely
affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments, possibly with a retroactive effect. Our effective
tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors in addition to our results of operations, accounting
standards and changes in accounting standards, and future changes in the law. If our tax positions are challenged by
relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect
or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations
or our effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For
example, in the United Kingdom, if the tax authority concluded that VAT was chargeable on a particular supply on
which we did not charge VAT to customers, we would be liable to account for such VAT. The occurrence of any of

76


-----

the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

In the jurisdictions in which we operate, governments might centrally adjust the value of business rates in
the property market. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the government adjusts the value of business rates to reflect
changes in the property market approximately every five years. The most recent revaluation came into effect in
England, Scotland and Wales on April 1, 2023 (based on rateable values from April 1, 2021). At revaluation, all
properties are given a new rateable value which, depending on the underlying movement in the value of the property,
can have an adverse impact on the tax liability due on the property. Adjustments to business rates could result in
increased costs and consequently could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations.

Further, legislation has been enacted or is currently under consideration in a number of jurisdictions to adopt
and implement Pillar Two of the base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project initiated by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”), which is designed to introduce a global minimum tax rate of
15% for certain multinational groups. In December 2021 and March 2022, the OECD published model rules and
related commentary to support member jurisdictions of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS (including the
United Kingdom) to implement the Pillar Two framework. For example, the United Kingdom government has
legislated to implement the Pillar Two income inclusion rule by introducing a “domestic top-up tax” and a
“multinational top-up tax” for certain large multinational and UK groups for accounting periods beginning on or after
December 31, 2023. The legislation applies to certain multinational and UK groups with annual group revenue
exceeding €750 million. Broadly, the “domestic top-up tax” may be assessed inter alia on UK located qualifying
entities of a qualifying group where the effective tax rate (“ETR”) of all UK members of the relevant group is less
than 15%. Further, the “multinational top-up tax” may be assessed inter alia on a UK responsible member (typically,
the ultimate parent, or where the ultimate parent is not in a territory which has implemented Pillar 2, the most senior
group member in such a territory) of a qualifying multinational group where members have an ETR of less than 15%
(as determined under the applicable rules) to the extent that a qualifying domestic top-up tax has not otherwise been
collected. Based on initial analysis undertaken by the Group, the Pillar Two transitional safe harbour is expected to
apply for each relevant territory and an election will be made such that no top-up tax charge is expected to arise in
respect of the accounting period ended December 31, 2024. If this were not to be the case, and the ETR of the Pillar
Two group members were to be at any point less than 15%, it is possible that Pillar Two top-up taxes could be assessed
on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and/or other members of the Group. Further changes related to Pillar Two are
expected to be implemented in the United Kingdom and in other jurisdictions in which we do business. The timing
and ultimate impact of any such changes on our tax obligations remains uncertain and will continue to be monitored
by the Group.

**_Tax disputes, tax audits and adverse decisions rendered by tax authorities may expose us to substantial tax liabilities_**
**_which could materially impact our business and reputation._**

Tax authorities, such as HMRC, periodically examine our activities. We often rely on generally available
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations, including interpretations made by the relevant tax authorities
and courts of law. Although we believe that we have adequately assessed and accounted for our potential tax liabilities,
and that our tax estimates are reasonable, there cannot be certainty that the relevant tax authorities are in agreement
with our interpretation of these laws, nor, as the case may be, that such tax authorities or courts will not depart from
their prior rulings or stated practice. In such instances, there may be, and there are currently, historical tax questions
on which tax authorities have taken different views or from which disputes have arisen or may arise, which if
unfavourably determined may require us to pay settlement amounts, assessment amounts, interest, fees or penalties,
which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Relating to Financial, Reporting and Other Matters**

**_The audit reports of Ernst & Young LLP and KPMG LLP included in this Offering Memorandum include_**
**_statements purporting to limit the persons that may rely on such reports and the opinions contained therein._**

The audit reports of Ernst & Young LLP for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 and the audit
report of KPMG LLP for the year ended December 31, 2023, which are included in this Offering Memorandum,
include a statement, in accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and

77


-----

Wales, that Ernst & Young LLP and KPMG LLP do not assume responsibility to anyone (including holders of Senior
Secured Notes) other than the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer’s members as a body, for its audit work,
audit reports or opinions it has formed. Each of Ernst & Young LLP and KPMG LLP has undertaken its audit work,
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, to state to the Senior Notes Issuer’s members
those matters that it is required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.

Investors in the Senior Secured Notes should understand that these statements are intended to disclaim any
liability to parties (such as purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes) other than to the Senior Notes Issuer and its
subsidiaries with respect to those reports. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a
registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities
Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the
limitation above, the recourse that investors in the Senior Secured Notes may have against the independent auditors
based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to
which auditors have responsibility or liability to third parties is unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including
the United Kingdom, and the legal effect of these statements in the audit reports is untested in the context of an offering
of securities. The inclusion of the language referred to above, however, may limit the ability of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes to bring any action against our auditors for damages arising out of an investment in the Senior Secured
Notes.

**_Limitation of Valuations – Property valuations are inherently subjective and uncertain and are based on_**
**_assumptions which may prove to be inaccurate. We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used,_**
**_estimates made or procedures followed in the third-party valuation report of our portfolio of real estate assets are_**
**_correct, accurate or complete._**

Property valuations are inherently subjective and uncertain and are based on assumptions which may prove
to be inaccurate. We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures
followed in the third-party valuation report of our portfolio of real estate assets are correct, accurate or complete. As
a result, the valuation report presents the external valuer’s best estimate of the value of the Group’s properties subject
to the assumptions and Special Assumptions set out above.

This Offering Memorandum refers to the CBRE Report with respect to certain of the real estate portfolio
owned by Asda. Valuation of property and property-related assets is inherently subjective and uncertain, in part
because all property valuations are made on the basis of information and assumptions which may not prove to be
accurate, and in part because of the individual nature of each property. Property valuations are complex, involve the
use of data which is not publicly available and involve a degree of subjective professional judgement by the valuers.
In valuing properties, the valuers are required to make certain key assumptions in respect of matters including, but not
limited to, the existence of willing buyers, title to the property, condition of structure and services, deleterious
materials, environmental matters, legal matters, statutory and regulatory requirements and planning, estimated market
rental values, market-based yields, expected future rental revenues from the property, where relevant potential future
trading performance, and other factors. In respect of properties which may require development, redevelopment or
refurbishment, the development considered achievable, assumed timescale, the assumed future development cost and
an appropriate finance rate and profit rate and/or discount rate are also used to determine the property value together
with market evidence and recent comparable properties where appropriate.

The adoption of different assumptions would be likely to produce different valuation results. The assumptions
made may prove to be inaccurate or not borne out by future events and could negatively affect the valuation of the
properties.

The CBRE Report was furthermore produced on a desktop basis and without visual inspection of Asda’s
properties. Where properties have not been inspected, the valuer will not carry out the usual range of enquiries
performed during a full inspection of properties and will make the appropriate assumptions based on the information
provided or available that, without a full inspection, cannot be verified. The instructing parties have acknowledged
and accepted the heightened and inherent uncertainty and risks relying upon a valuation prepared on a desktop basis.
The CBRE Report is thus based on information provided by management and certain assumptions, including, but not
limited to, the assumptions that (i) our properties are not adversely affected by any existing or proposed environmental
law and are free from, environmental issues such as contamination, deleterious materials, flooding, ground conditions,
invasive or protected plants or species and the properties are not adversely affected by any existing or proposed

78


-----

environmental law, (ii) there are no abnormalities as to repair and condition of the properties, all properties are free
from defect, in good repair and condition and well maintained and in marketable condition, compliant with all
building, accessibility and fire safety regulations and there are no abnormalities as to repair and condition of the
properties, (iii) properties possess a good and marketable freehold title free from any onerous restrictions or conditions,
and all title, tenure, lettings, planning, taxation, statutory and local authority requirements are complied with, (iv) all
properties benefit from full access and egress rights together with sufficient parking and loading facilities and are
connected to all main services, (v) the floor areas supplied by Asda comply with the RICS Code of Measuring Practice
(vi) no capital expenditure is required in respect of the properties and (vii) that the properties all have valid energy
performance certificates compliant with the relevant regulations in each jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. In
particular, CBRE has assumed each property to be the authorised use under planning legislation and in accordance
with the use registered with the relevant regulatory agency. During the course of their engagement, CBRE did not
perform site inspections, environmental audit, tests of services and amenities, investigations or tests as to the condition
of the properties. CBRE did not make planning or permitting enquiries and did not examine deeds, leases or other
documents relating to the title to our properties. The valuation assumed that the properties were in a reasonable state
of condition without material capital expenditure required. The CBRE Report was prepared as at the valuation date of
December 31, 2023 and is not as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. CBRE has not been requested to update
or revise any of the information contained in the CBRE Report as of any later date or the date of this Offering
Memorandum, is not under any obligation to do so and nor will it be asked to do so prior to the issuance of the Senior
Secured Notes or at any later date. Accordingly, the information included in the CBRE Report may not reflect the
current physical, economic, competitive, market or other conditions with respect to the Group properties.

Your attention is drawn to the fact that in respect of the Supermarket, Industrial, Office and Food to Go
Portfolios, the CBRE Report was additionally prepared upon the Special Assumption that the properties were let up
on leases of 15 – 25 years rather than their current status of being held with vacant possession. The Special
Assumptions are defined by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation – Global Standards (2022)
as “an assumption that either assumes facts that differ from the actual facts existing at the valuation date or that would
not be made by a typical market participant in a transaction on the valuation date.”

We cannot assure you that the assumptions or projections used, estimates made or procedures followed in
the CBRE Report are correct, accurate or complete. CBRE provided its valuation of the relevant properties as of at
the valuation date of December 31, 2023 and it does not take into account subsequent events. Accordingly, the
information included in the CBRE Report may not reflect the current physical, economic, competitive, market or other
conditions with respect to the property portfolio. CBRE have accepted no responsibility to any third party for the
whole or any part of the contents of the CBRE Report.

Other appraisers may reach a different valuation of Asda’s property portfolio. Moreover, the values
determined in the CBRE Report could be significantly higher than the amount that would be obtained from the actual
sale of the properties included in the Group Portfolio, especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario, if a sale of the
Properties is not subject to the assumptions or Special Assumptions in the CBRE Report, sale of a number of properties
in a portfolio, in the event of a downturn in the local, regional or national real estate market. Accordingly, the CBRE
Report should not be considered a representation of the actual present or future value of Asda’s property portfolio.
The realisable value of the applicable property portfolio at any given time will depend on various factors, including:

    - macroeconomic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere;

    - an economic downturn;

    - potential changes to the competitive landscape for grocery retail;

    - capital expenditure requirements;

    - changes in occupier and investor demand;

    - supply and demand generally affecting pricing;

    - adaptability or obsolescence;

79


-----

    - regulation (e.g., minimum energy efficiency standards);

    - changes in consumer behaviour and shopping habits, either organic or as a result of any other event listed
above or elsewhere under these “Risk Factors”; and

    - other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition, we anticipate that the value of Asda’s property portfolio will change over time, and it may change
materially. After the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes, neither third parties nor we will provide holders of the
Senior Secured Notes with a revised CBRE Report and we expressly disclaim any duty to update such CBRE Report
under any circumstance.

**_The unaudited financial data and forward-looking statements included in this Offering Memorandum need to be_**
**_carefully considered and may materially differ from actual results._**

This Offering Memorandum incorporates data for the three months ended March 31, 2024, that are derived
from preliminary financial results and estimates contained in our unaudited management accounts, which have not
been and will not be audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted auditing standards and are subject
to change. The data for three months ended March 31, 2024, presented in this Offering Memorandum is not intended
to be a comprehensive statement of our financial or operational results for the three-months ended March 31, 2024,
and is based on a number of assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. As such, you should not
place reliance on them when making an investment decision.

We have included data for the three months ended March 31, 2024 in order to provide information about our
recent performance but this information should be treated with a higher level of caution for reasons including but not
limited to the fact that management accounts are not prepared with the same level of rigor and are not subject to the
same level of management review and scrutiny as interim or year-end financial information. In addition, we provide
information about for the three months ended March 31, 2024, in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies,
which may differ materially from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and/or UK IFRS, in accordance
with which we have prepared the Financial Statements and certain other financial information included in this Offering
Memorandum. Furthermore, management accounts may not provide for closing procedures that are as detailed as
those conducted at period or year end. Additionally, management accounts may be subject to cut-off errors and
misallocation of items between months.

**_We may not have the ability to meet our additional financial and other reporting requirements or implement_**
**_effective systems of internal control and other standards, which may adversely affect our business._**

Our internal controls over financial reporting are intended to ensure we maintain accurate records, promote
the accurate and timely reporting of our financial information, maintain adequate control over our assets, ensure the
independence of our auditors and detect unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of our assets. Effective internal
and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to operate successfully as a
business. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls.

Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute,
assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon
certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control
systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future
conditions, regardless of how remote. If our internal controls do not keep pace with the size and sophistication of our
businesses and the applicable financial reporting framework, or we fail to successfully integrate the businesses we
acquired as part of the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition, we may not be able to implement and maintain
adequate internal controls. If we fail to implement and maintain effective internal controls, it could result in material
misstatements in our financial statements or failure to meet our reporting obligations in a timely manner, which may
cause a loss of confidence in our reported financial information which could increase our operating costs and
materially impair our ability to operate our business. See also “—Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions—We may not be
_able to successfully integrate the businesses we have recently acquired or will in the future acquire into our business.”_

Moreover, we may acquire companies or assets which we determine to be complementary to our current
business. Such acquired companies or assets may have insufficient systems of internal control, or otherwise have
defects which we do not discover until we begin to integrate these systems of internal control with ours. We cannot
assure you that we will be successful in integrating these systems of internal control with ours, or that such a task will
be within our initial expectations in terms of costs, resources and time expended.

**_Our non-current assets, primarily goodwill and store-level assets, may not be fully realisable and are subject to_**
**_periodic testing for impairment, and we may incur significant impairment charges as a result._**

Our non-current assets, primarily goodwill and store-level assets, are subject to periodic testing for
impairment. We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill. Total goodwill, which represents the difference
between the consideration paid plus any non-controlling interest and the acquisition date fair value of identifiable net
assets, was £1,182.2 million as of December 31, 2023, or 6% of our consolidated total assets. Within total goodwill,
the Arthur Acquisition resulted in goodwill of £290.5 million, of which £30.4 million has since been allocated to assets
held for sale, and the EG UK Acquisition resulted in goodwill of £922.1 million. The value of any goodwill recorded
on our financial statements may not be fully realisable upon sale of all or part of the business or any other liquidity
event.

Goodwill is recorded on the date of acquisition and, in accordance with UK IFRS, is tested for impairment
annually and whenever there is any indication of impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things,
deterioration in our performance, a decline in expected future cash flows, adverse market conditions, adverse changes
in applicable laws and regulations, any changes in the key assumptions used for internal calculations of values in use
and a variety of other factors. The amount of any impairment must be expensed immediately as a charge to our income
statement. We can give no assurance that we will not record any goodwill impairments in the future. Any future
impairment of goodwill may result in material reductions of our income and equity under UK IFRS.

**Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions**

**_Delays in our ability to separate from Walmart could result in significant cost and any issues with the separation_**
**_process, particularly related to our transition to a new IT system, could significantly disrupt business operations_**
**_and impact our ability to meet our strategic objectives._**

The separation from Walmart is a complex transaction that requires significant management attention and
poses a number of risks including, but not limited to, system cutovers and those related to the implementation of our
new IT infrastructure independent from Walmart.

Prior to the LBO Acquisition, the Asda Group was historically part of the operations of Walmart, which
provided us with operational, financial, and other support, and certain of our accounting and information technology
systems were incorporated in Walmart’s larger operations. As a result of the LBO Acquisition, we became a standalone
company and, accordingly, we have had to develop and implement the systems and infrastructure necessary to support
our current and future business.

On the LBO Acquisition Completion Date, Asda Stores Limited and Walmart entered into the TSA, under which
Walmart undertakes to provide certain information technology services to Asda on a transitional basis (the
“Transitional Services”). The Transitional Services include continuity of IT and communication services and provide
support and facilitate our ability to operate on a standalone basis. Under the TSA, each relevant Transitional Service
is to be supplied by Walmart until the earlier of (i) the migration of the relevant service as part of the separation of
Asda from Walmart, and (ii) the termination of the TSA by Walmart or Asda Stores Limited under certain
circumstances as described under “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements
_with Walmart—Transitional Services Agreement.” If Walmart terminates the TSA in accordance with its terms or is_
unable or unwilling to provide the Transitional Services as agreed, we may not be able to replace these services at an
acceptable price and in a timely manner, or at all. The Transitional Services include certain IT services which are
provided pursuant to third-party vendor contracts. These services will require the vendor consent to extend the term
of the underlying agreement past the LBO Acquisition Completion Date, and thereafter will have to be renegotiated
with the IT vendor.

81


-----

The complexity of our new IT system and of its implementation means that we may not be able to successfully
transition the systems to our standalone operations under Project Future. See “Risks Relating to Our Business and
_Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—We rely extensively on information systems to process_
_transactions, summarise results and manage our business. These systems are interdependent and disruptions in the_
_IT infrastructure that we use could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_
_condition.” Any failure to transition successfully within the terms of the applicable Transitional Agreement(s) may_
cause us to incur substantial expenses in addition to the anticipated separation costs and would have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

At the LBO Completion Date, Walmart and the LBO Seller also entered into several other transitional
agreements with various entities within the Asda Group alongside the TSA. The Transitional Agreements include a
TMA which includes licences of the George, Scan & Go, Smart Price and Rollback trademarks, certain domain names,
including George.com, as well as certain other Walmart-owned trade mark rights used by a member of the Asda Group
between October 2019 and the LBO Acquisition Completion Date. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart” for a description of the Transitional Agreements that are still_
in place. In the event any of our service relationships and agreements with Walmart are terminated, we may find it
difficult to find a suitable alternative supplier of such services in a timely fashion or at all. Any of the foregoing could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses we have recently acquired into our business._**

We may not be able to successfully integrate our recent acquisitions, namely the Arthur Acquisition and the
EG UK Acquisition, There is the risk that the integration of these acquisitions could result in significant added
complexity and management distraction, as well as difficulty related to, among other things, the integration of certain
operating and IT systems, including point of sale systems and inventory processing systems, the loss of customers or
key employees, the disruption of our respective ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards,
procedures and policies. Delays or issues could lead to additional cost which impacts profitability. Furthermore,
certain acquired contracts may have terms and conditions that are weaker than our standard contracts, and we may not
be able to integrate or update them as quickly as we would like or without incurring significant fees. In addition, we
may not have, or be able to retain or hire, employees with the appropriate skill sets for the tasks associated with our
integration plans, particularly in the expected time frame in which we require them, and could experience employee
departures and early retirement due to relevant business changes, all of which could adversely affect the success of
the integration plans. In particular, the loss of key managers or other experienced and knowledgeable local employees,
may result in the loss of knowledge and continuity for the relevant business. The integration process for our
acquisitions, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the realisation of the full expected benefits, including cost
savings and synergies. Failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating these businesses into our existing business
and to realise the anticipated benefits therefrom could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities
and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.

In order to fully integrate the financial accounting systems of our acquired businesses, we will also have to
complete the implementation of our own standalone IT system. Prior to the completion of Project Future, the
businesses acquired from the Arthur Acquisition are being migrated onto the IT systems of EG Group. Both the Arthur
Business and the EG UK Business will remain on the IT systems of EG Group for a transitional period, after which,
they will have to be transitioned onto our new system. This has required, and will continue to require, additional
capital investments by us, and may require incremental resources and system configurations that could increase our
operating costs in future periods, as we continue in our ongoing efforts to adjust our control environment to the
standards of a business of our size and scale. See also “—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating
_to Our General Operations—We may from time to time pursue acquisitions, which may prove more costly than_
_anticipated and may not generate anticipated synergies and which may have an adverse impact on our business, as_
_could our failure to successfully integrate such businesses following acquisition. Our business could also be negatively_
_impacted by merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by supranational and national laws and_
_regulations.”_

In connection with these acquisitions, we may also face risks related to unforeseen legal or regulatory issues
as we expand our fuel and convenience operations, difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure, and a
diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing
disruptions and integration matters.

82


-----

**_We may be unable to achieve some or all of the returns, synergies, cost savings or other benefits that we expect to_**
**_realise from our recent acquisitions or group initiatives._**

We cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully realise the expected benefits from the EG UK
Acquisition or the Arthur Acquisition or the group initiatives that we have taken, or expect to take, aimed at realizing
synergies, operational efficiencies or cost savings, or that the costs to realise these benefits will not be higher than
anticipated. A variety of risks could cause us not to realise some or all of the expected benefits. These risks include,
among others, unexpected costs associated with operating our business, inability to eliminate duplicative back-office
overhead or redundant selling and general and administrative functions and an inability to avoid labour disruptions in
connection with any integration of the foregoing. Our ability to successfully manage organisational changes is
important for our future business success. In particular, our reputation and results of operations could be harmed if
colleague morale, engagement, or productivity decline as a result of organisational or other changes.

Moreover, our implementation of these initiatives may disrupt our operations and performance, and our
estimated cost savings from these initiatives are based on several assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate and, as
a result, we cannot assure you that we will realise these cost savings. If, for any reason, the benefits we realise are less
than our estimates, or our improvement initiatives adversely affect our operations or cost more or take longer to
implement than we project, or if our assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially adversely affected. These actions may not provide the expected benefits, or could take
longer to achieve than expected, and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit key
personnel, decline in colleague productivity, weakening of internal standards, controls or procedures, and impairment
of key customer and supplier relationships. In addition, cost saving and operational efficiencies may not be able to be
sustained due to changes in customer needs, changes in regulations, availability and cost of materials or other cost
variables.

Our anticipated cost saving and benefits from the EG UK Acquisition and Arthur Acquisition are based upon
assumptions about our ability to implement cost saving measures in a timely fashion within certain cost parameters
and implement net cost savings which are in excess of inflationary cost increases. Our ability to achieve planned cost
saving and benefits of these acquisitions is dependent upon a significant number of assumptions, some of which may
be beyond our control, including the development of the markets for our products and services, political, legal, fiscal,
market and economic conditions including but not limited to cost price inflation through our supply chain, regulatory
developments, and tariff and wage increases. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these measures
proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be
able to realise fully or at all, or realise in the anticipated timeframe, the expected benefits from our cost saving and
operational measures.

We also undertake a number of group initiatives aimed at realizing synergies, operational efficiencies or cost
savings. There can be no assurance that our acquisitions or any of these initiatives will be as successful or accretive
as initially expected or meet our strategic goals. For example, we may fail to realise expected operational efficiencies
or cost savings. There is also a risk that the synergies that we seek to achieve may not be realised within the time
frame we currently anticipate, or at all, and that the magnitude of cost savings or operational efficiencies may be less
than expected or the costs of achieving these synergies may be higher than expected. Our anticipated synergies are
based on a number of assumptions, which are subject to uncertainties and contingencies that are outside of our control.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the warranties or pursuant to certain indemnification_**
**_obligations that Asda Holdings UK Limited has provided and undertaken under the LBO Acquisition Agreement_**
**_and related transaction documents._**

In connection with the LBO Acquisition, Asda Holdings UK Limited (the “LBO Seller”), has given certain
customary warranties and undertaken certain customary indemnification obligations in the LBO Acquisition
Agreement and related transaction documentation related to the Asda Group. Nonetheless, the LBO Purchaser may
not be able to enforce any claims against the LBO Seller relating to breaches of these warranties or in respect of such
indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if the LBO Purchaser is able to eventually recover any losses resulting
from a breach of these warranties or in respect of such obligations, the Purchaser, and therefore indirectly we, may
temporarily be required to bear these losses ourselves.

**Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure and the Senior Secured Notes**

**_Our leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,_**
**_liquidity, results of operation or prospects._**

As of December 31, 2023, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total third-party debt
of £4,500 million (equivalent) comprising Original Facility A, New Facility A, Facility B (EUR), the Private
Placement Facility, the Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Senior Notes and the Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior
Secured Notes. See “Capitalisation.” We are highly leveraged and that leverage could be sustained at this level or
higher for the foreseeable future. The level of indebtedness that we hold, and will continue to hold, could, among other
things:

    - limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures,
business opportunities and other corporate requirements;

    - reduce our flexibility to respond to, and pose additional risks for us in the face of, general adverse
economic and industry conditions;

    - reduce the portion of our Underlying Cash Flow From Operations that will be available for uses other
than servicing our debt, such as funding working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint
ventures or other general corporate purposes;

    - restrict us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;

    - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

    - place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;

    - negatively impact credit terms with our creditors; and

    - limit our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these, or other, consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, including our obligations under the Senior Secured Notes.

**_We may incur additional debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes, and impact our ability to operate our businesses._**

The agreements governing our debt limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, but do not prohibit us
from doing so. The terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures and
the Existing Senior Notes Indenture permit us (and, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will permit us)
to incur additional debt, including in respect of committed borrowings of at least £747,722,727 million under the New
Revolving Facility. Some of this debt could rank pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes, be structurally senior to
the Senior Secured Notes or be secured on assets which do not form part of the Collateral for the Senior Secured
Notes. Additional debt could also mature prior to the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, under the terms of the Existing
Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, we are
permitted, and under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, we will be permitted, subject to certain
conditions (including the refinancing of the term loan indebtedness outstanding as of the Issue Date under the Senior
Facilities Agreement in full), to incur new debt that has super senior priority status over the Senior Secured Notes in
respect of the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals. If new debt is added
to the Group’s existing debt levels, the related risks that we currently face would increase. Furthermore, if we are able
to designate some of our Restricted Subsidiaries under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as Unrestricted
Subsidiaries, those Unrestricted Subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the limitations specified in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and engage in other activities in which Restricted Subsidiaries may not engage. See
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes.” In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured
Notes Indentures and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture do not, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not,

84


-----

prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under each of these documents,
including short-term working capital facilities, which are permitted to be secured by security interests in the Collateral
(including on a super senior basis, subject to the refinancing or repayment of the Term Loan Facilities in full and
certain other conditions). If we are ever unable to service our debt, it would likely have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects and our ability to fulfil our obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its_**
**_obligations on the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is a holding company with no
revenue-generating activities of its own and no business operations, and its primary assets relate to its shares in
Acquisition 2 and its primary liabilities relate to inter-group balances with the Senior Notes Issuer, commitments
under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the issuance of the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the guarantees of the
Existing Senior Notes and the Transactions.

We expect our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds to meet our obligations in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes through a combination of dividends and payments in respect of intercompany loans. Our subsidiaries’
obligations under intercompany loans will be junior obligations and will be subordinated in right of payment to all of
the Group’s existing and future senior and senior subordinated indebtedness, including obligations under, or
guarantees of obligations under, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes.

If our subsidiaries do not distribute cash sufficient to make scheduled payments on the Senior Secured Notes,
we will not have any other source of funds that will allow us to make payments to the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes. In addition, various agreements governing the Group’s debt may restrict and, in some cases may actually
prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax laws may also
subject such payments to further taxation and applicable corporate law may limit the amounts that some of our
subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity interests, or even prohibit such
payments. In particular, our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends to us may be limited to the amount of distributable
reserves available to them. Finally, our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Senior Secured Notes have no obligation
to make payments with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes.

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that, even
though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may not be permitted
to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their consolidated group to another entity in their consolidated
group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

**_There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes under which the Collateral_**
**_securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the_**
**_Notes Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee._**

Under various circumstances, the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes will be released
automatically, including:

    - in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the Security Interest in respect
of the Issuer Share Collateral) to (a) a Person that is not the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant_
described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of
_Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes_
Indenture or (b) subject to certain exceptions, any Restricted Subsidiary;

    - in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and capital stock, of such Guarantor;

    - upon becoming a member of the Regulated Group, the release of the property and other assets, and
capital stock, of such member of the Regulated Group, and upon the borrower under an intercompany

85


-----

loan becoming a member of the Regulated Group, the release of any Security Interest in any receivables
under such intercompany loan;

- in case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary following the release of its Lien
granted in favour of the Senior Facilities Agreement (see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement—Guarantees and Security”), so long as no Event of Default_
has occurred and is continuing, the release of the property and assets, and capital stock, of such Restricted
Subsidiary; provided that there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets of such Restricted
Subsidiary that would result in the requirement for the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees
to be secured on such property, assets or capital stock pursuant to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture;

- pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including as
described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Required
_Consents—Provisions Following an IPO”);_

- as allowed under the amendments and waivers provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

- upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or upon
legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, as provided thereunder;

- if we designate any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and
capital stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

- upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event as described under “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status”;_

- in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation;

- as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; or

- in the case of any Proceeds Loan, or any other material intercompany receivables owed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries to the Senior Notes Issuer, upon its contribution to
the equity of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Issue Date.

In addition, under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically, including:

- upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the capital stock of the
relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition of all
or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

- upon the designation of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the Indentures;

- upon becoming a member of the Regulated Group;

- upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or upon
legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, as provided thereunder;

- with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and
discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities and (ii) does not guarantee any
Syndicated Term Facility or any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending commitments
in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination or Public Debt;

86


-----

    - pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including as
described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Required
_Consents—Provisions Following an IPO”);_

    - as allowed under the amendments and waivers provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

    - as allowed under the additional guarantees covenants of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

    - as a result of a transaction permitted by “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and_ _Consolidation—The Guarantors”; or_

    - in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation.

In addition, the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests will be subject to release upon a distressed disposal
as contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes.”_

**_The Senior Secured Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities and preference shares (if any) of the_**
**_Group’s non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of
preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of the
subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Senior Secured Notes
under the Notes Guarantees. For example, the lender under the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction (the “CGR Lender”)
is a priority creditor in respect of Asda Propco Limited (being the borrower under the Group Rent Transaction, which
a non-Guarantor subsidiary). In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation, reorganisation,
administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of the Group’s non-guarantor subsidiaries, holders
of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to payment of their claims from the assets of
those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for distribution to the parent entities of such non-guarantor
subsidiaries. As such, the Senior Secured Notes and each Notes Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to
the creditors (including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of the Group’s non-guarantor subsidiaries.
In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not require subsidiaries that become a member of the Regulated
Group to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes under any circumstances and any Notes Guarantee will be automatically
released upon the relevant Guarantor becoming a member of the Regulated Group.

As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023, the Guarantors collectively accounted for 98% of the Asda
Group’s consolidated revenues and, as of December 31, 2023, based on Asda’s allocation of properties for accounting
purposes (which has not been verified by an assessment of the registered proprietor of each of the properties) and
subject to matters disclosed in the section of this Offering Memorandum entitled “Valuation Report”, the Guarantors
hold sites representing over 99% of the value of the Market Value SA Properties (consisting of Asda supermarkets
(excluding supermarkets pledged in connection with the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction), Food to Go sites, industrial
properties and office properties), 90% of the value of the Market Value Properties (consisting of PFSs, investment
properties, development and landbank sites and a Distribution Centre – Held for Sale site) and 0% of the properties
leased in connection with the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2023,
subsidiaries that are not Guarantors had no third-party debt outstanding. In addition, our audited consolidated financial
statements include both Guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries and, as such, may be of limited use in assessing the
financial position of the Guarantors.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests in the relevant_**
**_assets._**

Under certain applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be properly
perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or the grantor of the
security. The security interests in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the claims of the Senior Secured
Notes if we, or the Security Agent, fail or are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these security
interests. The Security Agent has no obligation to perfect any of these liens or any security interest. In addition, certain
applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as

87


-----

real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly following
the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Absent perfection, the Security Agent, on behalf of the
holders of the Senior Secured Notes may have difficulty enforcing or may be entirely unable to enforce rights in the
Collateral in competition with third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors, including those who
claim a security interest in the same assets. The Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security Agent have no
obligation to monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or perfection of any
security interest and will not be expected to do so. There can be no assurance that we will inform the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee or the Security Agent of the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that
necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral.

**_Certain of the Collateral will not be granted until after the Issue Date._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured on the Issue Date by the Initial Collateral and will not initially
benefit from any security interest in the Post-Closing Collateral as described in “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Security.” Within 30 days of the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be further secured by first priority_
interests over the Post-Closing Non-Real Estate Collateral and within 180 days of the Issue Date, the Senior Secured
Notes will be further secured by first priority interests over the Material Real Property, in each case subject to the
Agreed Security Principles and as described in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security.”

There can be no assurance that the Group will be successful in procuring the Post-Closing Collateral within
the time period specified, if at all, and the failure to do so could result in an “event of default” under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture.

**_It may be difficult to realise the value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Collateral will be subject, in each case, to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other
imperfections permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the
Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by
other creditors that have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral from time to time, whether on or after the
date the Senior Secured Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and
other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to
realise or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of
factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterisation
under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

Enforcement of the Security Interests by the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally
associated with the realisation of security interests in collateral. For example, under English law, the enforcement of
share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The share
pledges will be enforced by the Security Agent. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.
Initially, the Security Agent will not be required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing
Group with a sufficient majority. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a
security interest. The Group cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents when
required to facilitate a sale of, or appropriate or otherwise foreclose on, the Collateral. For example, any change in the
direct or indirect control of Asda Stores Limited will require the approval of the FCA. Accordingly, the Security Agent
may not have the ability to sell or foreclose upon Collateral assets the sale of which would result in any such change
of control. In any such case, the value of the Collateral, may significantly decrease.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral, and the sale of_**
**_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Security Documents will, subject to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Senior
Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, allow the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and other security
providers to remain in possession of, retain control over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income
from the Collateral. So long as no acceleration event under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture is occurring or would
result therefrom, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, may, among other things, without any consent

88


-----

by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring or
otherwise disposing of Collateral and making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness.
Any of these activities could reduce the value of the Collateral and consequently the amounts payable to holders of
the Senior Secured Notes from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement.

**_The security interests over the Collateral will be granted to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Security_**
**_Agent, respectively rather than directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes._**

The security interests over the Collateral that will secure, amongst other obligations, the Group’s obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes Guarantees will not be granted
directly to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes but will be granted only in favour of the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee and the Security Agent, respectively. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide (along with the
Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the right to enforce the Security Interests in the Collateral.
As a consequence, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not have direct security interests and will not be entitled
to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes, except through the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) provide instructions
to the Security Agent in respect of the Collateral.

**_Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited_**
**_by applicable law or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability._**

Each Notes Guarantee will provide the holders of the Senior Secured Notes with a direct claim against the
relevant Guarantor. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and certain
other security providers will secure the payment of the Senior Secured Notes by granting security under the relevant
Security Documents. However, each security interest granted under a Security Document will be limited in scope to
the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest, and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
will provide that each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by the relevant
Guarantor, without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest (as applicable) voidable or otherwise
ineffective under English or other applicable law, and enforcement of each Notes Guarantee or Security Document
(as applicable) would be subject to certain generally available defences. These laws and defences include those that
relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally. See
“Certain Insolvency Considerations and _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests.”_

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other laws,
guarantees and security interests can be challenged (by the bankruptcy receiver or trustee, in case of bankruptcy of the
relevant Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such Guarantor outside bankruptcy), and a court could declare
unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or void, any legal act performed by a
Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Notes Guarantees or the security interests granted
under the Security Documents) and, if payment had already been made under a Notes Guarantee or enforcement
proceeds applied under a Security Document, require that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof)
return the payment to the relevant Guarantor, if the court found, inter alia, that:

    - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or the enforcement proceeds under the
relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum amount permitted under applicable law;

    - the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was incurred with actual
intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions,
even when the recipient was simply aware that the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant
Notes Guarantee or security interest;

    - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for granting the relevant
Notes Guarantee/security interests and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered insolvent because of
the relevant Notes Guarantee/security interest; (ii) undercapitalised or became undercapitalised because
of the relevant Notes Guarantee/Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would
incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; and/or

89


-----

    - the relevant Notes Guarantees/Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate objects of the
Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor.

We cannot assure you which standard a court would apply in determining whether a Guarantor or a party
granting the security interests was insolvent at the relevant time or that, regardless of the method of the valuation, a
court would not determine that a Guarantor or such party was insolvent on that date, or that a court would not
determine, regardless of whether or not a Guarantor or such party was insolvent on the date its Notes Guarantee was
issued or its security interests were granted, that payments to holders of the Senior Secured Notes constituted unfair
or voidable preferences, fraudulent transfers or voidable conveyances on other grounds.

**_The rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes in some of the Collateral may be adversely affected by such_**
**_security interests being second-ranking._**

The Collateral for the Senior Secured Notes may be granted by means of supplemental debentures to, and
confirmation agreements of, existing security agreements or by means of further layers of security documents. As
such, in certain circumstances, the Collateral may be second-ranking and only be deemed and treated as security
interests ranking pari passu with the security interests securing the Senior Facilities pursuant to the application of the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. If the Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant provisions thereof were
avoided or held to be unenforceable for any reason, holders of the Senior Secured Notes would not benefit from such
first-priority treatment and be subordinated, with respect to such security interests, to senior security interests over the
same Collateral securing the Senior Facilities.

**_Currency exchange rates may have an impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations_**
**_and prospects._**

We are subject to foreign currency translation and transaction effects because the Group’s business is based
in the United Kingdom and the Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in pounds sterling; however, we
have a significant amount of euro-denominated debt, including Facility B (EUR), and may incur further
euro-denominated debt in the future. Our results of operations may be affected by both the transaction effects and the
translation effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We are and will continue to be required to pay
principal and interest payments in a currency outside of our functional currency, exposing us to unrealised and realised
gains and losses due to foreign exchange depending on fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, fluctuations in the
euro-sterling currency exchange rate could have a substantial effect on our financial statements due to related gains or
losses resulting from the conversion into sterling of euro-denominated liabilities. Although we may use currency
swaps to hedge against the effect of changes in the euro-sterling rate and some purchases in US Dollars are managed
using forward contracts, there can be no assurance that hedging or such forward contracts will be available on
commercially reasonable terms and, even if such arrangements are available, they may not completely insulate us
from currency exchange risks. In addition, hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a
significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging arrangements.

The Group is currently contemplating additional cross-currency swaps as well as interest rate swaps in respect
of the unhedged portion of our ongoing EUR exposure and floating rate exposure respectively under the Senior
Facilities Agreement. From time to time we also enter into additional currency swap transactions in order to manage
any operational currency exposures. We may, but are under no obligation to, enter into additional foreign exchange
interest rate swaps or cross currency swaps as well as interest rate swaps in order to hedge our ongoing EUR exposure
and floating rate exposure respectively under the Senior Facilities Agreement. However, there can be no assurance
that such hedging will eliminate the potentially material adverse effect of such fluctuations.

See also “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Financial Risk Overview—Foreign Currency Risk.”_

**_Our variable interest rate debt may be impacted by applicable regulation and may bear interest that could rise_**
**_significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The debt the Group has incurred, and may incur in the future, under the Senior Facilities Agreement bears
interest at variable rates, and we are exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates. In addition, the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture will permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may bear a floating rate of interest.

90


-----

These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our interest expense associated with these
obligations, reducing cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures or other general corporate
purposes and hindering our ability to make payments on the Senior Secured Notes. Although we may enter into and
maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging
will be available on commercially reasonable terms or that it will continue to be available on such terms in the future.
Hedging itself carries certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to
terminate any hedging arrangements.

In addition, any elimination of any applicable benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of such
benchmark, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt. Any such consequence
could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any such floating rate debt. If any applicable
benchmark was discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined
for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt. Any such change, as well as manipulative
practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in a reported benchmark rate, which
could have an adverse impact on the Group’s ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_The insolvency laws of England and Wales and other jurisdictions may not be as favourable to you as the_**
**_U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Senior Secured Notes from recovering payments due on the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer are incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales, the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, and certain other security providers
may be, incorporated under the laws of Jersey. In addition, the Security Documents will be governed by the laws of
England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and the rights under the Security Documents will thus be subject
to the laws of such jurisdictions. In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be
initiated in England and Wales or another relevant jurisdiction. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings may be complex
and more costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of
your rights. Holders’ rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and the Security Documents, as applicable, will be subject to the insolvency, property and administrative laws of
several jurisdictions and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such
complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, property, administrative and other laws of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s, the Guarantors’ and the other security providers’ jurisdictions of organisation or incorporation may be
materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the areas of rights
of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the
proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular
jurisdiction’s law should apply, adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Senior Secured Notes,
the Notes Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents, as applicable, in those
jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. Further, certain orders, proceedings or appointments entered,
undertaken or effected with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer or the Guarantors
(including pursuant to a scheme of arrangement or a restructuring plan under the Companies Act 2006) that may
adversely affect Holders’ rights under the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Security Documents may not result in any default or event of default occurring under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. See “Certain Insolvency Considerations and _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of_
_the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests” with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above._

**_The Group may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes Indenture._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a “change of control,” the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
would be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Senior Secured Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to
101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. A change of control
may also result in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an obligation to mandatorily prepay amounts
outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior
Notes Indenture and other indebtedness. A change of control may also lead to an obligation to mandatorily prepay all

91


-----

amounts under the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction (where “change of control” means Asda Group Limited ceases to
control the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction holding structure, or there is a change in the ownership of the wider Group
that results in ownership by a person who does not satisfy the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction lenders’ “know your
customer” or similar identification procedures). If a change of control were to occur, we cannot assure you that the
Group would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that it would have sufficient funds to provide to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes or repay or prepay the
Ground Rent Facility, Senior Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured Notes or the Existing Senior Notes or that the
restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior
Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Group’s other existing contractual obligations would allow us to
make such required repurchases, repayments or prepayments. The repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes pursuant
to such an offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The ability
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to receive cash from its subsidiaries to allow it to pay cash to the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by the Group’s then existing
financial resources. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to repurchase
the Senior Secured Notes upon a change of control. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such
financing. Any failure by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to offer to purchase the Senior Secured Notes would
constitute a default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, which would, in turn, constitute a default under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and
certain other indebtedness. See “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control.” In addition, a change
of control could constitute a default under the Group’s other indebtedness and the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction (but
only in the latter case if the acquiring entity does not satisfy the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction lenders’ “know your
customer” or similar identification procedures). Additionally, an enforcement of the share pledge over the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer could constitute a “change of control” under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the 2023
Ground Rent Transaction. Future indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its subsidiaries may also contain
prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a change of control or require such indebtedness to be repurchased
or repaid upon a change of control.

**_In certain circumstances, a Change of Control Offer will not be required to be made._**

The change of control provisions contained in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may not necessarily afford
you protection in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganisation, restructuring, merger or
other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may not involve a
shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a “Change of Control” as defined
in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Except as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change
_of Control,” the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the Senior Secured_
Notes Issuer to offer to repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a reorganisation, restructuring,
merger, recapitalisation or similar transaction.

The definition of “Change of Control” in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will include a disposition of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to
any person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree
of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “substantially all” of the assets of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole. As a result, it may be unclear as to
whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes, in which case your ability to sell the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes may be limited._**

The Group cannot assure you as to:

    - the liquidity of any market in the Senior Secured Notes;

    - your ability to sell your Senior Secured Notes; or

    - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Senior Secured Notes.

92


-----

Future trading prices for the Senior Secured Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other
things, prevailing interest rates, the Group’s operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically, the
market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in
the prices of securities similar to the Senior Secured Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the Senior Secured
Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject to disruptions
that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Senior Secured Notes may attract different investors
and this may affect the extent to which the Senior Secured Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for the Senior
Secured Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of
the Senior Secured Notes, regardless of the Group’s prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no
assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes. If no active trading market develops,
you may not be able to resell your holding of the Senior Secured Notes at a fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made for the Senior Secured Notes to be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange, the Group cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes will become or remain listed. Although no
assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Senior Secured Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Official
List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to
listing on another stock exchange) of the Senior Secured Notes as applicable, from the Exchange may have a material
effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could
exacerbate the impact of a lack of sufficient liquidity of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Senior Secured Notes will be denominated and payable in pound sterling. If investors in the Senior
Secured Notes measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than sterling, such investment in the
Senior Secured Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant
changes in the values of the pound sterling relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return
on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which the Group has no control.
Depreciation of the pound sterling against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their
investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Senior Secured Notes below their stated coupon rates
and could result in a loss to investors when the return on such Senior Secured Notes is translated into the currency by
reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Senior Secured Notes
denominated in a currency other than U.S. dollars by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a
result of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United States Federal
_Income Tax Considerations.”_

**_The Senior Secured Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Senior Secured Notes may be issued with original issue discount (“OID”) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. The Senior Secured Notes will be considered to be issued with OID if the stated principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes exceeds their issue price (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) by an amount
equal to or more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount. In such event, investors in the Senior Secured Notes
subject to U.S. federal income taxation generally will be required to include such OID in their gross income (as
ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, such investors generally will include any OID in income
in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. See “Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United States
_Federal Income Tax Considerations—Original Issue Discount.”_

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

Each of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective
subsidiaries are organised outside the United States, and the Group’s business is conducted entirely outside the United
States. The directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer
and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes
Issuer, the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries will submit to the jurisdiction of certain New York courts in
connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable to effect service of process within the United

93


-----

States on these directors, managers and executive officers. In addition, as all of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors,
managers and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments
obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, actions of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer
and the Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United
States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other
than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with England and Wales. There is, therefore, doubt as
to the enforceability in England and Wales of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such
jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in England and Wales of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether
or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt
that a court in England and Wales and Jersey would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in
an original action brought in such jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. Securities laws violations. For further information
see “Service of Process and Enforcement of Judgments.”

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject to_**
**_revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Senior Secured Notes. The
ratings may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors discussed
in this Offering Memorandum and other factors that may affect the value of the Senior Secured Notes. A credit rating
is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by
the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period
of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if, in its judgment,
circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned
to the Senior Secured Notes by one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and
conditions of the Group’s financings and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Certain covenants will be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in the Group’s ratings._**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, if at any time following the Issue Date, the Senior
Secured Notes receive both a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody’s and a rating of BBB- or better from Standard &
Poor’s (or, in each case, the equivalent rating by Fitch if either Moody’s or Standard & Poor’s has no rating for the
Senior Secured Notes) and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day the
provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described in “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status” will not apply to the Senior_
Secured Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such rating agency to the Senior Secured
Notes should subsequently decline to below such ratings, the foregoing covenants will be reinstituted as of and from
the date of such rating decline. If these covenants were to be suspended, the Group would be able to incur additional
debt or make payments, including dividends or investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the
Senior Secured Notes. In addition, during the period in which the covenants are suspended, there will be no restrictions
on our ability to designate any of our subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that the
Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve an investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_The lender under the Ground Rent Transaction Facility Agreement may call an event of default if the notes issued_**
**_pursuant to the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction cease to have a rating._**

The Ground Rent Transaction Facility Agreement provides that if the notes issued pursuant to the 2023
Ground Rent Transaction cease to have a rating, then this triggers an event of default. This would permit the lender
under the Ground Rent Transaction Facility Agreement to accelerate the facility and enforce security.

**_We may choose to provide further cash to our subsidiary Asda Propco Limited in certain circumstances in_**
**_connection with the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction._**

On June 30, in each calendar year beginning on June 30, 2029, certain trigger events may require Asda
Propco Limited to deposit cash (from subordinated debt, equity injection or free cash in the general account of Asda
Propco Limited) as additional collateral for the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction or to substitute applicable superstores.
The amount of cash required to be deposited depends on the percentage of stores operated on properties that are subject

94


-----

to the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction (“Portfolio Stores”) that are affected stores. Whether a store is an affected
superstore is dependent on the sales performance of that superstore relative to all of the superstores we own. It ranges
from (if the affected Portfolio Stores represent less than 15% of such rent for all Portfolio Stores) 12 months of rent
for all affected Portfolio Stores for the year to June 30 (“Allocated Rent”) to double the Allocated Rent (if affected
Portfolio Stores represent 50% or more of portfolio Allocated Rent).

If an event of default occurs under the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction, the lenders thereunder may enforce
over the relevant properties and therefore we would no longer own those properties.

If an event of default arises under the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction, the lenders thereunder may accelerate
the loan and enforce their mortgages over the properties subject to the transaction, or over the shares in Asda Propco
Limited (which owns the freehold or long leasehold interest in all of the relevant properties). Events of default are
included for the insolvency of the tenant under the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction (i.e., Asda Stores Limited), and for
persistent non-payment under or material breach of the CGR Ground Leases. In the case of the latter, such an event
of default will not arise unless either (i) in respect of a CGR Ground Lease in England & Wales, a notice of intended
forfeiture under s.146 Law of Property Act 1925 has been served on the tenant and the tenant has not complied with
such notice, or (ii) in respect of a CGR Ground Lease in Scotland, an irritancy warning notice has been served on the
tenant, and Asda Propco Limited has not substituted the affected property. It is proposed that the Ground Rent
Transaction Facility Agreement will be amended to reflect the distinction between forfeiture and irritancy in English
and Scottish leases, respectively.

**_We have certain liabilities under the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction where the lenders’ recourse is not limited to_**
**_the value of the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction properties._**

Asda Group Limited has entered into a tax deed of covenant with Asda Propco Limited and the lender under
the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction for the purposes of managing certain group level tax compliance obligations in
respect of the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction. The tax deed of covenant also contains a tax indemnity given by Asda
Group Limited to Asda Propco Limited to cover the imposition of unexpected tax liabilities arising in connection with
the Asda Group. For example, the tax deed of covenant contains an indemnity covering the imposition of any
secondary liability taxes or the imposition of any de-grouping charge.

Asda Group Limited has provided an indemnity in favour of the lender under the 2023 Ground Rent
Transaction for any increased costs it incurs itself, and for any liability for increased costs incurred by noteholders in
each case in the event the transaction is characterised as a securitisation under UK Securitisation Regulation Rules or
EU Securitisation Regulation Rules. In addition, Asda Group Limited undertakes to take such actions as are within its
control to comply with UK Securitisation Regulation Rules and EU Securitisation Regulation Rules, and to procure
that Asda Propco Limited and any relevant affiliate does likewise.

**_The transfer of the Senior Secured Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at_**
**_which they may be sold._**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been registered under, and the Group is not
obliged to register the Senior Secured Notes or the Notes Guarantees under, the Securities Act or the securities laws
of any other jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from,
or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable laws. See
“Notice to Investors.” The Group has not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register any of the Senior Secured
Notes or the Notes Guarantees, and do not have any intention to do so.

**_The Senior Secured Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the Senior Secured Notes are in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are
issued in exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of
book-entry interests will not be considered owners or holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The common depositary
(or its nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes. Payments of
principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the global notes representing the Senior Secured Notes
will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream. Thereafter, these

95


-----

payments will be credited to participants’ accounts that hold book-entry interests in the global notes representing the
Senior Secured Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After payment to the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest,
principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, owners of book-entry interests in the
Senior Secured Notes must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and if such owners are not a
participant in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, on the procedures of the participant through which their interest is owned,
to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Senior Secured Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any
direct rights to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. Instead, owners of book-entry interests will be permitted to act only to the extent they have received
appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a participant. There can be no
assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies will be sufficient to enable an owner of a book
entry interest to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, unless and
until the definitive registered Senior Secured Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, owners of
book-entry interests will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We can make no assurances that
the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise
of rights under the Senior Secured Notes.

**_The interests of the group’s principal shareholders may conflict with your interests._**

The interests of the Group’s principal shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your interests
as holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, all of the outstanding shares of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are held by the Senior Notes Issuer, which is 50% indirectly owned by Mohsin and
Zuber Issa and 50% indirectly owned by funds managed by TDR Capital LLP. See “Principal Shareholders.” As a
result, the principal shareholders have, and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to, among other
things, affect the Group’s legal and capital structure and its day-to-day operations, as well as the ability to elect and
change its management and to approve any other changes to its operations. Our shareholders may make strategic
decisions with regards to their ownership of the Group that may not be aligned with the interests of holders of the
Senior Secured Notes. For instance, they may seek to acquire further ownership interests or dispose their existing
ownership interests in the Group. Our principal shareholders may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions,
divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, will enhance their equity investments, although
such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Senior Secured Notes. For example, these shareholders
could vote to cause us to incur additional indebtedness, sell certain material assets or pay dividends, in each case, so
long as the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes
Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of additional
indebtedness could increase the Group’s debt service obligations, the payment of dividends would reduce the Group’s
ability to meet its debt service obligations or fund working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes
and the sale of certain assets would reduce the Group’s ability to generate revenue, each of which could adversely
affect holders of the Senior Secured Notes. Such transactions may not be in the best interests of the Group or the
holders or the Senior Secured Notes.

In addition, TDR Capital is in the business of making investments in companies and may, from time to time,
acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. TDR Capital may also pursue
acquisitions that may be complementary with our business and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be
available to us. So long as our shareholders continue to indirectly own a significant amount of the outstanding shares
of our common stock, even if such amount is less than 50%, our shareholders will continue to be able to strongly
influence or effectively control our decisions.

In addition, our principal shareholders own EG Group, which operates in the fuel and convenience retail
industry in jurisdictions including the United Kingdom, and may, in the future, own businesses that directly compete
with ours or do business with us. This may give rise to a conflict of interest for such directors in circumstances where
the interests of EG Group are not aligned with the Group’s interests. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions.”_

**_We will be subject to significant restrictive debt covenants, which limit our operating and financial flexibility._**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain covenants which impose significant operating and financial
restrictions on us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other things:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

    - make certain restricted payments and investments;

    - transfer or sell assets or enter into sale and leaseback transactions;

    - enter into transactions with affiliates;

    - create or incur certain liens;

    - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions of minority interests;

    - create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other payments
to us;

    - take certain actions that would impair the Security Interests granted for the benefit of the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes;

    - incur or enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, ground rent transactions and qualified
securitizations involving real property; and

    - merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.

These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to
pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we are subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, which, in the case
of the negative covenants, are substantially in line with those applicable to the Senior Secured Notes (other than certain
additional covenants applicable to the Senior Facilities Agreement customary for facilities of that nature and certain
covenants applicable to the Private Placement Facility that are more restrictive than included in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture). See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement—Covenants.”
Asda Propco Limited is also subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants in connection with the 2023 Ground
Rent Transaction (which are transaction-specific and broadly based on the Loan Market Association Single Currency
Term Facility Agreement for Real Estate Finance Multiproperty Investment Transactions). A breach of any of those
covenants could result in an event of default under those debt documents, which could lead to an event of default and
acceleration under our other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the
Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures and the Existing Senior Notes Indenture. If our creditors accelerate the
payment of amounts owing to them under such other debt instruments, we cannot assure you that our assets and the
assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all our other liabilities and the
liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make payments to enable us to repay the Senior
Secured Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those amounts, our creditors could proceed
against any security interests granted to them to secure repayment of those amounts.

**_We may be unable to access the short-term and long-term funding required to meet business needs._**

The availability and ability to access appropriate levels of funding and liquidity on financial terms acceptable
to us is critical for continued business operations. Our Treasury function seeks to ensure that we continue to have
access to sufficient funding by, amongst other things, monitoring rolling forecasts of our cash flows, which includes
our ability to service our debt obligations. We have sought to manage our liquidity through entry into short-term
financing arrangements with a number of third-party financial institutions, including arrangements to allow a number
of our suppliers to participate in supply chain finance (“SCF”) arrangements with such financial institutions. Such

97


-----

arrangements reduce pressure on supplier payment terms, allowing payments in respect of supplier invoices on longer
payment terms and correspondingly increasing short-term liquidity. However, as these SCF facilities are uncommitted
and the level of funding financial institutions provide pursuant to them is discretionary, there is a risk that these
facilities will not be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. A decision by one or more of these third-party financial
institutions to reduce the amount of funding available pursuant to such SCF facilities or fully withdraw the access to
such SCF facilities, or a disruption to one or more of the financial institutions providing such facilities, could adversely
affect our cash flows and liquidity. The withdrawal of such facilities could lead to a review of payment terms by
suppliers, with a significant reduction in payment terms to suppliers risking a working capital outflow.

If these programmes or underlying supplier terms do not continue and we are unable to secure alternative
programmes, our cash and working capital may be negatively affected and we may have to increase our long-term
borrowings for short- and long-term liquidity requirements.

For a description of our supply chain finance arrangements, see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Supply Chain Facilities.”_

We are also subject to the risk that our capital structure may not be sufficient to support the growth of our
business and maintain our existing credit rating. Our capital structure consists of debt obligations (including the Senior
Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Existing Senior Notes) and equity
(issued share capital, share premium and reserves). Part of our capital risk management strategy is to monitor a broad
range of financial metrics and manage compliance with financial covenants relating to our debt obligations. There is
a risk that we are unable to access to financial markets to obtain appropriate sources and levels of funding at economic
rates or debt funding is removed due to noncompliance with lending agreements and related covenants.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt, fund working capital, rental and lease payments_**
**_and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate or raise sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our_**
**_control._**

On the Issue Date, we expect to issue a significant amount of debt and will have significant debt service
obligations, including under the Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Senior Notes
and the Senior Facilities. Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on and to refinance our debt,
and to fund working capital, rental and lease payments and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating
performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on the success of our business
strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors discussed
in these “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, as well as other factors, many of which are
beyond our control. This also depends on our cash flow cycle, which experiences seasonal fluctuations. Levels of
customer traffic at our stores are affected by the weather and travel patterns, among other factors, which could also
have a negative impact on our cash position and impact our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and
to fund working capital and capital expenditures. If our interest or lease payment dates coincide with periods of
significant cash outflow, we may have insufficient cash to pay our obligations as they come due.

We cannot assure you that the currently anticipated cost savings, revenue growth and operating improvements
will be realised, that cash flows from operations will be sufficient, or that future debt and equity financing will be
available to us on satisfactory terms or in an amount sufficient to enable us to refinance all or a portion of our debt,
pay our debts when due, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our obligations as
they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

    - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

    - sell assets;

    - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

    - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, on or before maturity.

98


-----

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our
financial condition at such time as well as on many factors outside of our control, including then-prevailing conditions
in the international credit and capital markets. In such event, we may not to be able to meet our debt repayment
obligations. In addition, the terms of our debt limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these
alternatives. See _“—We will be subject to significant restrictive debt covenants, which limit our operating and_
_financial flexibility.” Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and could require us to comply with_
more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations
and prospects. There can be no assurance that any assets which we could be required to dispose of could be sold or
that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realised from such sale would be acceptable.

Furthermore, our inability to meet payment obligations under our existing debt could trigger various default
provisions, accelerate a substantial portion (if not all) of our debt, and would materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not control decisions regarding the Collateral in certain circumstances._**

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes and the Guarantees will be secured on a
first-priority basis by the same Collateral securing the obligations under the Senior Facilities. In addition, under the
terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Group is (or, in the case of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, will be) permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations
that may be secured by the same Collateral on a pari passu basis, including other credit facilities and certain hedging
liabilities.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, who is also the security agent for the
lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be
incurred by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement, will act only as provided for in
the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Initially, the Security
Agent will not be required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing Group (as defined
under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”) that comprises creditors holding
more than 50% of the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement, and indebtedness
ranking pari passu with such indebtedness (the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”) (in each case acting through
their respective creditor representative). Additionally, the Senior Facilities Agreement allows (or, in the case of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, will allow) the Group to incur additional indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis
with the Senior Secured Notes, which would further dilute the voting interest of holders of the Senior Secured Notes
issued on the Issue Date.

The lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and creditors in respect of any indebtedness secured on a
_pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes that we may incur in the future may have interests that are different_
from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous
for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or any of its holding companies or subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action or other distressed disposal in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees
against, and the liens over any other assets of, such entities and any subsidiaries of such entity securing the Senior
Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Release_ _of Liens.”_

**_The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes._**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by security interests
in the Initial Collateral, within 30 days of the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be
secured by security interests in the Post-Closing Non-Real Estate Collateral and, within 180 days of the Issue Date,

99


-----

the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be secured by security interests in the Post-Closing Real
Estate Collateral, in each case as described in this Offering Memorandum. The Collateral securing the Senior Secured
Notes will also secure the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indentures and, with respect to the Shared Security, the Existing Senior Notes (on a second-priority basis). Such
Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes to the extent permitted
to be incurred by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The holders of Senior Secured Notes’ rights to the Collateral may therefore be diluted by any increase in
the debt secured by such Collateral on a pari passu or senior basis or a reduction in the value of the Collateral securing
the Senior Secured Notes.

The value that holders of the Senior Secured Notes may receive upon enforcement of the Collateral will
depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell this Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition
of the economies in which our operations are located and the availability of buyers. The book value of the Collateral
should not be relied on as a measure of realisable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Collateral may be
illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there will be a market
for the sale of the Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In
addition, the share pledges over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or
bankruptcy proceeding. The Collateral is located in England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and the
multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the Collateral may limit its realisable value. For example, the
bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from,
or conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors,
ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. In addition, third parties may have rights over
Material Real Property (including rights to acquire and pre-emption rights) exercisable in the event of transfer of such
Material Real Property (including as a result of enforcement of security interests in such Collateral). In such cases,
the enforcement of the security interests over, or transfer of, such Material Real Property may be significantly delayed,
prevented in part or prevented entirely.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes or the incurrence_**
**_of permitted debt in the future, may create or restart hardening periods, i.e., the periods of time following the_**
**_granting of security interests during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the laws_**
**_applicable in certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees following the
Issue Date may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions. The granting of shared
security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such
hardening periods in particular, as the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security
granted in favour of the Senior Secured Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence
of future indebtedness and a Permitted Reorganisation. Please see “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Security.”_

The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security
interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced
before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective
and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Please see “Certain Insolvency Considerations and _Limitations on Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_If the New Revolving Facility is designated as super senior liabilities in accordance with the terms of the_**
**_Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, creditors under the New Revolving Facility and_**
**_counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness permitted to be incurred on a super senior_**
**_basis under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement are entitled to be_**
**_repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority to the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement of the
Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events,
including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned-over amounts
and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward discharging the super senior obligations
(including, among others, (following the designation of the New Revolving Facility as super senior liabilities in

100


-----

accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) those under the
New Revolving Facility, certain hedging obligations and supply chain financings that may, pursuant to the terms of
the Indentures, be secured on a super senior basis (the “Super Senior Liabilities”) under certain circumstances,
including the refinancing in full of the Term Loan Facilities) in priority to applying any such amounts toward
discharging the Senior Secured Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the Senior
Secured Notes may not benefit from such recoveries if the then-outstanding claims under such Super Senior Liabilities
are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral will, after all
obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities (other than the New Revolving Facility where a designation of the New Revolving
Facility as super senior liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement has occurred) and any
other obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes.
Furthermore, claims of other secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Senior Secured
Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As such,
the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured
creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness.

101

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

The gross proceeds from the Offering are expected to be approximately £1,750 million (equivalent).

On or about the Issue Date, we will use the gross proceeds from the New Financing and cash on hand to
(i) partially repurchase the Existing Senior Secured Notes, (ii) prepay and cancel Original Facility B in full and (iii)
pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.

In this Offering Memorandum, we refer to the following as the “Transactions”: (i) the New Financing and
the use of proceeds therefrom, including the making and consummation of the Richmond Tender Offer, (ii) the
establishment of New Facility A and New Revolving Facility and use of proceeds therefrom, (iii) the Facility A
Maturity Extension, the Revolving Facility Maturity Extension and the Facility B Refinancing, (iv) the payment of
fees and expenses related to the Transactions, and (v) to the extent not used to repurchase and cancel Existing Senior
Secured Notes in connection with the Richmond Tender Offer, prepay and cancel the Original Facility B in full and
pay the aggregate fees and expenses in respect of the Transactions, the holding of the New Financing Proceeds on
balance sheet (in cash or cash equivalents) and the application thereof to repay any Existing Senior Secured Notes
(other than the Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes) that were not subject to, or not tendered or accepted
in, the Richmond Tender Offer, as applicable, which is currently anticipated to be at the stated maturity in relation to
the Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes and at, or soon after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date in relation to
the Existing 4.50% Senior Secured Notes. The Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes, which were not
targeted under the Richmond Tender Offer, representing £500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing
3.25% Senior Secured Notes, will not be included in the repayment described in clause (v) above, and therefore will
remain outstanding following the Transactions.

**Richmond Tender Offer**

Concurrently with the Offering, we have launched an offer to purchase for cash our outstanding Existing
Senior Secured Notes held pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities Act (the “Richmond Tender Offer”) up to
a certain maximum acceptance amount, expected to be set not to exceed (x) the sum of (i) the aggregate net proceeds
from the New Financing and (ii) £415 million less (y) the sum of (i) the aggregate amount required for the prepayment
and cancellation of the Original Facility B in full and (ii) the aggregate fees and expenses in respect of the Transactions.
Pursuant to the terms of the Richmond Tender Offer, we will not accept any tenders with respect to Existing Senior
Secured Notes held pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured
Notes, representing £500 million in aggregate principal amount of the Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes, which
were not targeted in the Richmond Tender Offer, will remain outstanding following the Transactions. The Richmond
Tender Offer is being made upon terms and subject to the conditions set out in the separate tender offer memorandum
dated April 26, 2024 (the “Tender Offer Memorandum”). The Richmond Tender Offer is conditioned upon the
satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation of the New Financing, on
terms satisfactory to the Issuer in its sole discretion.

We cannot assure you that the Richmond Tender Offer will be consummated in accordance with its terms, or
at all, or that any of the Existing Senior Secured Notes will be tendered and purchased in the Richmond Tender Offer.
The Offering is not conditioned upon the consummation of the Richmond Tender Offer. The maximum amount of
Existing Senior Secured Notes and the maximum amount of each series of Existing Senior Secured Notes accepted in
the Richmond Tender Offer will be determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in its sole and absolute discretion,
subject to the terms of the Richmond Tender Offer. This Offering Memorandum does not relate to the Richmond
Tender Offer, which is only made upon the terms and subject to the conditions set out in the Tender Offer
Memorandum, and is only made to certain eligible holders of Existing Senior Secured Notes holding book-entry
interests in the Regulation S global note.

**Sources and Uses**

The following table illustrates the estimated sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions.
The estimated fees and expenses related to the Transactions are shown in the table below as of the expected Issue
Date. Actual amounts may vary from these estimated amounts due to several factors, including the gross proceeds
derived from the Offering, the accrued and unpaid interest due in respect of the Existing Senior Secured Notes and
Original Facility B, original issue discounts and the fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions.

and cancel the Original Facility B in full and pay the aggregate fees and expenses in respect of the Transactions, on balance sheet (in cash or
cash equivalents) until applied for the redemption of the outstanding (x) Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes (other than the Remaining
Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes) that were subject to the Richmond Tender Offer, but were untendered or unaccepted for repurchase, at
stated maturity, and (y) of the outstanding Existing 4.50% Senior Secured Notes at, or soon after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date. As
such, such amount is not reflected in our as adjusted cash and cash equivalents.

(2) The actual column reflects the £186 million outstanding under Original Facility A as of December 31, 2023, adjusted to give effect to a £19.5
million amortization payment made in February 2024. The Group has initiated a process with key relationship banks and lenders seeking an
extension of its Revolving Credit Facility and Original Facility A. The as adjusted column reflects the maximum amount of un-extended
commitments under Original Facility A, with a minimum amount of £9,775,000 of commitments under Original Facility A expected to remain
outstanding on or around the Issue Date.

(3) The Group has initiated a process with key relationship banks and lenders seeking an extension of its Revolving Credit Facility and Original
Facility A. The as adjusted column reflects a minimum of £92,250,000 of commitments that will be extended under New Facility A, with a
possible additional commitment of £63,725,000 under Original Facility A which could be extended under New Facility A on or shortly after
the Issue Date. New Facility A will be utilised on or around the Issue Date and the proceeds of such utilisation will be applied (directly or
indirectly) in or towards financing part of the outstanding amounts under the Original Facility A on a cashless basis. See “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.”_

(4) Represents the €1,050 million aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness to be incurred under Facility B (EUR) that we expect to enter
into on or around the Issue Date, established under the Senior Facilities Agreement. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Senior Facilities Agreement.” The proceeds from Facility B (EUR) have been converted to pounds sterling at a convenience exchange rate of_
€1.166 per £1.00. This exchange rate has been provided solely for the convenience of potential investors and should not be construed as a
representation that EUR amounts could have been, or could be, converted into GBP at the rate set forth herein or at any other rate. The Group
may enter into one or more cross-currency swaps to convert euro amounts from Facility B (EUR) into GBP.

(5) The as adjusted amount of Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes gives effect to (i) £500 million in aggregate principal amount of the
Remaining Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes that were not subject to, or not tendered or accepted in, the Richmond Tender Offer and will
remain outstanding following the Transactions and (ii) the cancellation of those Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes tendered and accepted
as part of the Richmond Tender Offer, which for purposes hereof we have assumed will be £1,750 million in aggregate principal amount. If
less than 100% of such Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes are tendered and accepted, following the closing of the Offering, we intend to
hold outstanding New Financing Proceeds that are not used to purchase tendered and accepted Existing Senior Secured Notes, prepay and
cancel the Original Facility B in full and pay the aggregate fees and expenses in respect of the Transactions on balance sheet (in cash or cash
equivalents) until applied for the redemption of the outstanding Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes (other than the Remaining Existing
3.25% Senior Secured Notes) that were subject to the Richmond Tender Offer, but were untendered or unaccepted for repurchase, at stated
maturity.

(6) The as adjusted amount of Existing 4.50% Senior Secured Notes gives effect to (i) the cancellation of those Existing 4.50% Senior Secured
Notes tendered and accepted as part of the Richmond Tender Offer, which for purposes hereof we have assumed will be £500 million in
aggregate principal amount. If less than 100% of such Existing 3.25% Senior Secured Notes are tendered and accepted, following the closing
of the Offering, we intend to hold outstanding New Financing Proceeds that are not used to purchase tendered and accepted Existing Senior
Secured Notes, prepay and cancel the Original Facility B in full and pay the aggregate fees and expenses in respect of the Transactions on
balance sheet (in cash or cash equivalents) until applied for the redemption of the outstanding Existing 4.50% Senior Secured Notes at, or
soon after, the First Optional Par Redemption Date.

(7) Total third-party debt does not include lease liabilities and any obligations under our supply chain financing arrangements. Lease liabilities
recorded in the Group’s audited condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023, prepared in accordance with UK IFRS, were
£3,790.2 million. The Group also carries £387.6 million of long-term debt liabilities on its balance sheet related to the £400 million mortgage
loan made to Propco (as defined herein) in connection with the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction, which are not included in total third-party
debt.

(8) Represents, on an actual basis, equity attributable to the owners of the Group as of December 31, 2023.

(9) This capitalisation table is presented based on the carrying value of the principal of the third-party debt rather than at amortised cost in
accordance with IFRS 9.

**Overview**

We are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom and the second-largest grocery retailer in the
North of England, Scotland and Wales (in each case in terms of Till Roll data on a 52-week basis as of January 21,
2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We operate a significant store estate of over 1,200 large stores and
convenience sites that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom. We also have the second largest
online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of
January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We are also now a major player in the UK convenience market,
having added 472 convenience sites (including petrol filling stations) to our portfolio, as well as 124 stand-alone
foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites), following the Arthur Acquisition and EG UK Acquisition. These
acquisitions have given us significant foothold in the fast-growing convenience market which, alongside our existing
fuel portfolio, makes us the second-largest independent fuel owner-operator in the United Kingdom.

The graph below compares our total grocery market share with that of other major UK grocery retailers based
on Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel.

_(Source: Kantar Worldpanel, Take Home Panel, Grocery, 52 w/e January 21[st] 2024, Till Roll.)_

We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by favourable
macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household expenditure on food and
beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through economic fluctuations. Groceries
are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe generally allows the grocery retail market to
weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market
demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and
during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed only by a slight contraction as the pandemic eased. Since, the UK grocery
retail market has experienced consistent growth, achieving a record-high size of £144.0 billion in sales for the 52week period ended December 24, 2023, according to Kantar Worldpanel, despite facing high inflation and global
geopolitical tensions in 2022 and 2023. See also “Industry.”

One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is in turn
centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to offering high quality
products with low prices to our customers and our wholly-owned supplier, International Procurement and Logistics
Ltd (“IPL”), which enables us to take a vertically-integrated approach to procurement and which we believe gives us
a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and
well-established George Clothing and George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers, our
growing presence in the convenience and foodservice market, our popular customer loyalty programme Asda
Rewards, and our team of flexible and engaged colleagues.

We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended December 31,
2023, our revenue was £25.6 billion (including fuel), with 16.5% of sales made online, our net cash flow from
operating activities was £1,245.8 million, our profit for the year was £194.5 million, and our Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA was £1,264 million.

Excluding the results of the EG UK Business, which was acquired on October 31, 2023, and the results of
the Arthur Business, which was consolidated from May 31, 2023, the chart below presents the breakdown of our 2023
revenue by product category (food, general merchandise, clothing and petrol), and channel (stores and online
(including George.com)).

_(Source: Asda information. Year ended December 31, 2023. Note: excluding approximately £588 million from the Arthur Acquisition, £411_
_million from the EG UK Acquisition and £199 million of other revenue from Asda Mobile sales, financial services sales, shipping and wrapping_
_revenue, pharmacy revenue and, until the EG UK Acquisition, Asda On The Move.)_

Our differentiated operating model has resulted in strong financial performance: our successful financial
profile is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital
Expenditure KPI) and cash conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. For
more information on our differentiated operating model, see “—Key Strengths—We benefit from a differentiated
_operating model.”_ Between 2021 and 2023, our average profit margin (defined as profit for the year divided by
revenue) was 4.3%, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.2% (including fuel), our cumulative cash flows from
operating activities totalled £3,340.6 million, cumulative free cash flow was approximately £2,097 million and our
average cash conversion was 68%. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial
_Data—Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_

We believe that our business, operating model and financial performance also benefit from our significant
freehold real estate asset portfolio, which also can provide a potential source of liquidity. See “Valuation Report.” In
2023, through the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and 2023 Ground Rent Transaction, we have been able to,
and in the future may continue to, selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to take advantage of
favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities. See “—Lease Agreements.”

We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we maintain
a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom. We have made more than
£300 million annualized price investment since 2022 across over 1,200 lines. Within the UK value market, we have
strong market shares across core grocery products (13.1%), beers, wines and spirits (12.8%), impulse grocery (12.1%),
household and pet (12.1%), frozen (11.4%) and total grocery (11.4%) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute
Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). Our offer is strong across the full
food basket: our category market shares range from 9.6% to 13.1% (except health and beauty)(in each case in terms
of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We
believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal

110


-----

Asda data, our prices are approximately 2.5% to 6.1% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on the
average of the first eight weeks in 2024, based on total goods price gap percentage). We believe our prices continue
to compete with those of discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. In January 2024, we launched a new price matching
programme where we have price matched Aldi and Lidl on approximately 300 comparable grocery products, which
reduced prices by an average of 17% to match whichever discounter had the lowest price on these products.

Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is supplemented
by a large clothing and general merchandise business. We offer our entire range of food and non-food products to
customers as an accessible “one-stop shop” experience that is supported and enhanced by our strong online offer and
expansion into the convenience market under the Asda Express banner. We believe our omni-channel offer, through
which we reach customers at our brick-and-mortar stores and through our significant online offering and on our app,
appeals to our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic increased use of and engagement with our online platforms. In
the first half of 2021, there were approximately 8.6 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with order growth
from approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended
February 28, 2020) to an average of more than 773,000 weekly orders in 2021 (based on the average weekly orders
for the first 26 weeks of 2021) and a peak of more than 850,000 orders during the third lockdown (based on the seven
days to January 15, 2021). Online engagement has fallen from the peaks experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic,
but we have continued to grow our online business, with an average of approximately 774,000 weekly orders in 2022
and 2023 (based on the average weekly orders in 2022 and 2023). We also offer at-home delivery and customers are
able to collect their purchases at one of approximately 460 Asda Click & Collect sites. Our business model integrates
our store-based and online offer by leveraging our stores to fulfil online orders.

Our online grocery business is profitable within one of the world’s most developed online grocery markets.
According to Kantar Worldpanel, as of January 21, 2024, we operate the second-largest online grocery platform in
the United Kingdom, holding 19.3% of market share (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales),
growing our market share in a market that is 5.5% larger on a one-year basis (comparing Total Grocery Absolute
Online Sales from the 52 weeks ended January 22, 2023 to the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024). Our online business
is already of significant scale; the chart below shows the growth of our online sales, including a breakdown of online
grocery versus George.com sales, for the periods presented.

_(Source: Asda information.)_

According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the third-largest online clothing, footwear and accessories retailer
in the United Kingdom by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024 and we held 8.5% of the total
UK online clothing, footwear and accessories market by volume for the 24 weeks ended January 7, 2024. Combined
sales for our online grocery business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion
(of which £1.5 billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £3.6 billion in
2023 (of which £3.2 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR
of 16.2% between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, our ‘toyou’ service allows customers to conveniently collect and

111


-----

return orders from George.com and other partner retailers at our stores. We have partnered with 112 brands and
processed more than 4.4 million parcels in the year ended December 31, 2023.

We also have a strong presence in the convenience market with significant opportunity for additional
expansion in this fast-growing sector. In October 2022, we took our first notable step into the convenience market
after acquiring 132 sites including 129 convenience sites attached to forecourts from the Co-op (the “Co-op sites,”
and such business, the “Arthur Business”) and three development sites as part of the Arthur Acquisition. We agreed
to divest 13 of the Co-op sites following the recommendation of the CMA after an Initial Enforcement Order stemming
from its review of the acquisition. The disposals of these sites completed across December 2023 to January 2024 for
proceeds of £25.2 million. Each Co-op site included a grocery retail store between 1,500 and 3,000 square feet of
space and an attached petrol filling station driving footfall. In October 2023, we acquired the majority of EG Group’s
business in the United Kingdom for total cash consideration of £2.1 billion (including transaction fees). The deal
represented a major step in our convenience proposition, adding 356 well-invested PFSs to our convenience portfolio,
161 of which are stand-alone and 195 of which are co-located with foodservice concessions, as well as 124 stand-alone
foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). In foodservice, we acquired franchises for some of the United
Kingdom’s best loved outlets, including Greggs, Subway, Burger King and Sbarro, as well as our own proprietary
brand, Leon. Certain of our acquired sites also continue to benefit from an additional KFC and Starbucks non-Group
branded offerings operated by third parties. Through this acquisition, we accessed another high-growth sector,
foodservice, tapping into a new market which is highly complementary to Asda’s current offering. Each of the acquired
sites are community-focused and strategically located at the heart of residential areas with a diversified footprint across
the United Kingdom, and represent broader retail destinations with ancillary services such as parcel delivery, car wash
and last mile food delivery, with opportunity to expand further. The acquired sites also present a significant
opportunity for further synergies across Asda’s business through higher volumes, buying synergies and cost savings
through operational leverage.

In September 2023, we began the conversion of the Co-op sites from Co-op branding to our Asda Express
banner, implementing Asda pricing across fuel and grocery upon conversion. We completed the conversion of the
remaining convenience sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in
March 2024. Total capex investment to convert the stores to Asda Express was approximately £17 million. We believe
we will be able to bring Asda’s great value to even more customers across the United Kingdom by reaching new
communities and shoppers with this smaller store format. In the converted Co-op sites, our Asda Express prices were
an average of 6.1% cheaper than their corresponding prices under Co-op ownership. We also have further organic
Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in 2023 and a strong pipeline of approximately 40 sites that
have been identified for potential opening in 2024. Going forward, our focus will be on the continued integration of
the Co-op sites and EG UK Business into the Asda Group and delivering synergies.

Currently, with our team of approximately 150,000 flexible and engaged colleagues, with around 98,000 fulltime employees, serving approximately 16.8 million customer trips each week (based on the average of weeks 37 to
40 of 2023), we are committed to and deeply invested in the UK food supply chain.

Our business model is supported by diversification. First, we are a mass market retailer that serves the entire
UK population, in terms of both customer demographics and geography, with our customer base skewing slightly
towards value-seeking families, younger shoppers and lower-income customers who are attracted by our strategy to
offer high quality products at low prices and with strong market shares in the North of England, Scotland and Wales.
For more information about our customer mix, see “—Our Customers,” and for more information about the geographic
distribution of our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.” Second, we believe we are well-positioned geographically, with
a strong regional footprint across the United Kingdom. Our store footprint is strongest in the North of England,
Scotland and Wales. Our large and diverse store estate offers customers a variety of differentiated shopping formats.
We operate 30 supercentres, 396 superstores, 153 supermarkets, 30 Asda Living stores, 499 convenience sites
(including our petrol filling stations) and 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). For more
information on our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.”

We continue to benefit from certain support provided by Walmart through the Transitional Agreements,
primarily in relation to the continued use of its IT platform. We have set up a dedicated team to facilitate the transition
of our IT environment away from the Walmart ecosystem and onto a stand-alone IT solution, which we refer to as
Project Future. We believe Project Future presents significant opportunities in terms of our efficiency, data
capabilities, customer experience and competitive edge and are targeting complete separation from Walmart by the

**Segment Reporting**

We are engaged in a single reportable operating segment of business: the retailing of food (including grocery
and foodservice outlets), clothing, general merchandise, fuel and services in a single geographical segment, the United
Kingdom and online. The majority of our revenue is generated by the sale of goods through retail outlets in the United
Kingdom and through the Group’s online channels. The operations of all product areas of the business are subject to
similar economic characteristics and are sold in a similar retail environment. The Group is not reliant on any individual
major customers.

**Key Performance Indicators**

We use certain financial key performance indicators (“KPIs”) to monitor the financial and operating
performance of our business. For an overview of these KPIs, including definitions and reconciliations, see
“Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures” and “Summary Historical
_Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our results of operations are affected by a combination of factors. This section discusses key factors that we
believe have had a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition during the periods under review,
as well as those that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition
in the future. While we believe that our results of operations and financial condition, and particularly the results of
operations and financial condition during the periods under review, have been primarily affected by the following key
factors, these factors are not exhaustive, and the entirety of this Offering Memorandum should be reviewed,
particularly the “Risk Factors” section. Additionally, although we believe that the underlying operating trends that
have benefitted our business in recent years, as described further below, are relatively stable and will generally
continue to drive relatively steady patterns of revenue and EBITDA metrics, it is difficult to predict future performance
with any degree of certainty.

**_Competitive Environment_**

We operate in the highly competitive UK grocery retail market, which we believe is undergoing a period of
significant structural change, characterised by factors such as strong growth and aggressive pricing on the part of
discounters (such as Lidl and Aldi) as well as the other traditional grocers, and a shift away from large
brick-and-mortar stores to online purchasing and convenience retail, all against the backdrop of the general political
and economic uncertainty, including high inflation and the ongoing war in Ukraine, and any lingering impacts of the
COVID-19 pandemic, the latter of which has accelerated many of these trends. In a highly competitive environment
during a time of economic uncertainty, there is a risk we are unable to navigate changes in market structure or
consumer shopping trends leading to failure to enhance brand value, an inability to execute our strategic plan and we
could be exposed to loss of market share.

Across all of our market channels, we compete with grocery retailers and other operators for customers,
employees, locations, products and other important aspects of our business. Our success depends on our ability to
satisfy customer needs more effectively than the competition. In order to do so, we have adopted a strategy to
differentiate ourselves from our competitors and compete effectively against them on range, quality, price,
convenience of location and the overall shopping experience, among other things. We believe our market proposition
is that we offer the greatest value in terms of the price and quality of our products. For example, through our M&S
Taste Match campaign, hundreds of our products were voted “as tasty” or “tastier than” their M&S equivalents, while
our recent Aldi and Lidl Price Match programme delivers a broad range of popular everyday products at discounter
rates. Our market differentiation strategy focuses on optimising our product offerings, monitoring our mix of formats
and store concepts, expanding into convenience formats, strengthening our brand identity and seeking out

113


-----

opportunities to increase omni-channel sales. Further, our strategy is based on what we believe to be a well-established
own-brand grocery offering, our large and diverse store estate that caters to our customers’ different preferences and
our deployment of digital tools and online platforms and innovation and a well-known and successful clothing and
general merchandise brand, George.

Competition may also affect the prices we charge for our products, which in turn impacts our revenue and
margins, although this is usually experienced on a product-specific basis. For example, a competitor may cut its prices
to attract footfall to its stores, which in turn may require us to respond with a similar price reduction. In January 2024,
we announced a new price matching programme where we have price matched Aldi and Lidl on 287 comparable
grocery products, which reduced prices by an average of 17% to match whichever discounter had the lowest price on
these products. This Aldi and Lidl Price Match programme runs alongside our established customer value
propositions, including Price Drop and Asda Rewards. We have also implemented various other strategic initiatives
and investments in new product development, particularly low cost/high-quality options. For example, in May 2022,
we launched a new grocery opening price point range, Just Essentials By Asda. The range replaced the existing budget
offering, Asda Smart Price, expanding the range from approximately 160 to 272 products, with items reformulated
and refreshed to offer optimum price and quality.

Prices for most of our products are set on a national basis and, as a result of significant structural changes to
the UK grocery market, there has been substantial pressure on profit and EBITDA margins across the industry, which
has led market participants to engage in intense short-term promotional activity, particularly through multibuy offers,
member pricing and selective price cuts. At the same time, we have also experienced an overall market trend of food
and other input price inflation. For example, increases in the UK National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage,
alongside voluntary wage increases to support workers in this high inflationary environment, have led to grocery
market wage inflation. Moreover, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to significant pressures on the energy market,
which further accelerated rising inflation. As a result, we and other grocers experienced input inflationary pressures
relating to food prices, energy and fuel. Following the easing of COVID-19 lockdown measures across the United
Kingdom in the first half of 2021, the increase in economic activity led to increased pressure across global supply
chains, including in relation to labour shortages within the food manufacturing supply chain (including shortages of
HGV drivers ), a lack of container capacity within global shipping, increases in wholesale energy prices, shortages of
certain raw materials (including CO2); and increases in commodity prices which have resulted in input price inflation
within the supply chain, and there is no assurance that such pressures will not further increase in the future. Sourcing
and supply chain challenges could also be exacerbated through climate change and adverse weather conditions.

We manage this input cost inflation in several ways, such as by using our bargaining power with suppliers,
increasing or decreasing the prices of certain products to offset each other, through product re-engineering, for
example by maintaining the same price point and altering the weight or recipe, but without compromising on quality
and, in certain circumstances, passing through cost increases to consumers. In addition, we have also worked with
suppliers to help alleviate the challenges arising from recent supply chain pressures. This has included using our own
logistics network to support suppliers in the transportation of products from their manufacturing sites to our
distribution centres, and amending ordering profiles to enable suppliers to better manage the efficiency of their
production lines. These changes, however, have put pressure on our profit and EBITDA margins during the periods
under review. Whilst the level input inflation as of the date of this Offering Memorandum has been reduced compared
to 2022 and 2023, we expect input cost inflation to continue during the remainder of 2024.

We also operate in the highly competitive UK clothing and footwear retail market through the George
Clothing brand, which offers a wide variety of low cost, high-quality clothing and apparel for babies, children, men
and women, including jewellery, footwear and hosiery selections. The George Clothing brand was the number three
clothing, footwear and accessories retailer by volume of units sold in the United Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended
January 7, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel, with strong margins as compared to food categories and strong
online growth in the past three years. However, we face competitive challenges in the clothing and footwear retail
market, including from competitors that continue to invest in their online and in-store presence. Such competitors
target some of George Clothing’s key customer categories. We will continue to face steep competition on the basis
of, among other things, the location of our stores; our website and mobile applications, and their respective design;
the breadth, quality, style, price and availability of our merchandise; and the level of customer service offered. See
“Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—

_Grocery Retail Market Competitive Landscape.”_

**_General Economic Conditions in Our Geographic Markets_**

Our core grocery retail business generated 84.2% of our total sales (excluding fuel) for the year ended
December 31, 2023. The grocery retail business is generally relatively insulated from swings in demand related to
general economic conditions because consumer purchases of grocery and non-grocery staples tend to be less
discretionary than purchases in other retail categories. Certain of our other non-grocery offerings, on the other hand,
are more correlated to discretionary spending, and therefore, are more susceptible to changes in general economic
conditions. Such offerings, including George Clothing and general merchandise, generated 15.8% of our total sales
(excluding fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2023.

Notwithstanding the overall resilient nature of our core grocery retail business, consumer tastes and shopping
practices are affected by specific economic conditions in the local markets in which we operate, as well as, to a lesser
extent, global economic conditions. Such conditions include employment levels, inflation, GDP growth, average and
minimum wage levels, real disposable income, currency exchange rates, consumer confidence and consumer
willingness to spend. In addition, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 resulted in national and local authorities
mandating or recommending various restrictions and other measures throughout most of 2020 and the first half of
2021, including mandatory business restrictions and closures and social distancing, quarantine and lockdown
measures. However, our grocery operations were classified as an essential business in all locations in which we operate
and remained open to serve the needs of our customers. As a result, with many other stores closed and consumers
often preferring to do as much shopping as they could in one place to minimise potential exposure to the virus, we
experienced exceptionally strong sales during this time. These results were partially offset by other challenges during
the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased cleaning costs, supply chain delays, increased freight costs and wholesale
energy prices and shortages of certain raw materials. While our operations have largely recovered from the impacts
of COVID-19 and the worst of the outbreak is largely considered to be in the past, there could be additional outbreaks
and there is a risk of continued disruption as a result of such outbreaks at locations within our supply chain, or other
related disruption at suppliers.

As the COVID-19 pandemic waned and related governmental measures were eased, the economy reopened
and our results in 2022 and 2023 decreased from the highs experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. However,
as the world emerged from the global pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked an energy crisis which further
accelerated growing inflation and cost-of-living pressures have continued to create uncertainty for customers and
businesses alike. When consumers are confident about current and future economic conditions, we believe our
premium grocery offerings, some of which carry higher margins than core products, are more likely to attract shoppers
and that customers with rising disposable incomes are more likely to make impulse purchases, which can be margin
accretive and lift average basket sizes. Conversely, during an economic downturn, basket sizes may tend to decrease
while frequency of trips increases as customers disposable income reduces and they carefully manage their spend
within a more constrained household budget. Consumers may increasingly opt for cheaper alternatives, such as
“discount” retailers, and we may record more purchases of our affordably-priced and attractive mid-tier and opening
price point own-brand products relative to local and international third party branded goods.

The high inflationary environment, however, can also drive revenue as a result of the price inflation of
products, rather than solely relying on an increase in the volume of products sold. During times of economic stress,
however, we believe our value proposition is also particularly appealing to customers and can further drive sales and
volumes. As the current high inflationary environment persists, we are focused on initiatives to support our customers
in the cost-of-living crisis and protect market share by investing in price and quality. For example, in April 2022, we
launched our Dropped and Locked price campaign, which locked in the prices of a variety of products. As a result,
prices on these products dropped by an average of 12% and locked until the end of 2022 to give customers certainty
around their shopping in light of these cost-of-living pressures. While we expect the UK grocery market to remain
resilient into 2024, we also expect customers to continue feeling the impact of cost pressures on their household
budgets as they face a real wage decline, making it more important than ever that we continue to focus on providing
our strong value offering in food and non-food to enable us to serve customers on any type of budget. Additionally,
our expansion into the convenience market provides further opportunity as customers increasingly desire convenience
and accessibility and represents progress towards our strategic objective to be accessible to customers.

affecting its growth, see “Industry.”

**_Convenience and Integration Strategies_**

The Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition have had a key role in shaping our commercial strategy,
and the implementation of these strategies and integration of these businesses will have an impact on our results of
operations.

We now have an active strategy to penetrate the convenience market, which will accelerate following the
acquisition of 356 PFSs and 124 standalone foodservice sites through the EG UK Acquisition and 116 convenience
sites as part of the Arthur Acquisition. Following the trial of Asda On the Move, where we offered Asda-branded
products at sites owned by EG Group, we recently launched the Asda Express brand for our standalone Asda owned
and operated convenience sites. These Asda Express convenience stores stock up to 3,000 branded and own-label
products to suit a broad range of customer needs. In December 2022, we opened our first two organic Asda Express
stores. We also have further organic Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in 2023 (including five
opened in the fourth quarter of 2023) and a strong pipeline of approximately 40 sites that have been identified for
potential opening in 2024. The sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition have all been
converted to the Asda Express branding. We believe that these store concepts will allow us to access the convenience
market and are responsive to changes in our customers’ lifestyles. However, there can be no assurance that this venture
into the convenience sector will be successful or profitable. The development of this convenience proposition will
also require additional capital expenditures and may have a significant impact on our results of operations.

We also anticipate £86 million of synergies stemming from incremental uplift to Asda’s margin from the EG
UK Acquisition and the Arthur Acquisition. We expect to achieve these synergies from price investment in the fuel
and grocery offering, which we believe will lead to in an increase in volumes and will in turn enable buying benefits
across the Asda product portfolio. In addition, we expect synergies to arise from range optimisation, monetisation of
customer data, our increased scale, in-store marketing income, improvement in fuel card terms and operational
efficiencies. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully realise the expected synergies and
benefits from the EG UK Acquisition and the Arthur Acquisition, or that the costs to realise these synergies and
benefits will not be higher than anticipated.

The integration of the EG UK Business and Arthur Business into the Group could also result in various
challenges, including related to the integration of certain operating and IT systems, including point of sale systems
and inventory processing systems, the loss of customers or key employees, diversion of management’s attention, the
disruption of our respective ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards, procedures and policies.
Furthermore, certain contracts may have terms and conditions that are weaker than our standard contracts, and we
may not be able to integrate or update them as quickly as we would like or without incurring significant fees. In order
to fully integrate the financial accounting systems of our acquired businesses, we will have to complete the
implementation of our own standalone IT system. Prior to the completion of Project Future, the business acquired
from the Arthur Acquisition is being migrated onto the IT systems of EG Group. Both the Arthur Business and the
EG UK Business will remain on the IT systems of EG Group for a transitional period, after which, they will have to
be transitioned onto our new system. If the TSA expires before we complete the implementation of Project Future or
we are not able to successfully transfer onto our new IT platform, this could result in increased costs or a material
disruption to the business. Project Future and the integration of the Arthur Business and EG UK Business have
required, and will continue to require, additional capital investments by us, and may require incremental resources
and system configurations that could increase our operating costs in future periods, as we continue in our ongoing
efforts to maintain our control environment to the standards of a business of our size and scale.

**_Sensitivity of Our Cost Structure_**

Excluding purchases of goods sold, we have a largely fixed cost base in the short- to medium-term, which
does not fluctuate with sales volumes. Instead, our costs generally increase from period to period based on the
sensitivity of certain costs to inflation. We are able to control some costs to a certain degree, such as those related to
marketing and labour (via short-term contracts as well as adjustments to the number of hours our colleagues work),
but must maintain sufficient sales levels to absorb the increase in our expenses in order to maintain or improve our
retail margins. We have also been able to reduce overall costs by leveraging our vertically integrated procurement

116


-----

arm, IPL, which is a wholly-owned supplier that serves us exclusively and provides us with a cost price advantage by
eliminating the “middle man” in our supply chain and sources goods such as fresh fruit and vegetables, flowers, cooked
meats and wines. However, even after taking such actions, certain expenses such as rent, the price of food ingredients,
energy costs, energy taxes and other direct and indirect taxation are outside of our control. See “Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—We are vulnerable to cost_
_inflation and fluctuations in the availability and price of food ingredients and products, commodities and packing_
_material, as well as to fluctuations in the price of electricity and fuel and labour, transportation and manufacturing_
_costs.”_

Labour costs represent a significant part of our cost structure. Whilst we can adjust the size of our workforce,
where we have proposals to reduce our headcount, we have legal obligations to consult with colleague representatives
(including trade unions) and engage other labour force actors before proposals can be implemented. The obligation to
consult with colleague representatives may result in amendments to proposed reductions in headcount and therefore
take time before we can implement such changes should they proceed. Additionally, we are subject to laws setting
minimum wages. During the periods presented, the UK government increased the National Minimum Wage and
National Living Wage and we agreed to further wage increases to support our colleagues and ease inflationary
pressures, which had an impact on our cost structure and generally increased our costs, although this has been in part
offset by cost saving and efficiency initiatives. For example, in April 2023, we voluntarily increased our rate for hourly
paid store colleagues to £11.00 an hour and further increased this in July 2023 to £11.11 an hour. For stores inside the
M25 and around Greater London, our rate for hourly paid store colleagues increased to £12.28 an hour. The national
minimum wage is due to increase to £11.44 an hour in April 2024, and we plan to give our colleagues an interim
increase, with those inside the M25 and around Greater London receiving £12.61 an hour. In July 2024, we are
proposing a further increase in pay to 120,000 of our colleagues which will increase the basic pay for retail workers
to £12.04 an hour, with those at stores inside the M25 and around Greater London receiving £13.21 an hour. Overall,
this is an 8.4% increase in pay from £11.11 in July 2023 to the proposed £12.04 in July, 2024. Any further increase in
wages, energy, maintenance or any other input in our cost structure which is not mitigated, can also affect our results
of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General
_Operations—Our failure to attract and retain qualified colleagues, increases in labour costs and social charges and_
_other changes to wage regulations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_
_condition.”_

**_Investment in New Store Concepts and Channel and Product Innovation_**

One of the drivers of our results of operations is our ability to maintain our traditional customer base and
attract new customers through our ongoing investments in fulfilment capacity and development of our operations,
including the evolution of our network of brick-and-mortar retail stores. Our retail store network is largely mature;
however, we regularly evaluate the performance of our stores and have repositioned and remodelled stores under new
store concepts to improve our customers’ experience and respond to their changing preferences. For example, we have
refocused capital expenditure on remodelling our existing stores, in particular to realign store space and offerings to
enhance our customer proposition and better respond to customers’ shopping behaviour. In October 2020, we opened
our first “sustainability store” at our Middleton superstore location, which is a concept designed to encourage
customers to reuse and refill their products, allowing customers to bring and fill their own containers with products
such as coffee, rice, pasta and other goods, as well as offering second-hand clothing and increased recycling options.
We have since opened three further refill sections in our stores in Toryglen, York and Milton Keynes. We are also
further responding to shifting customer preferences, who increasingly desire fast and accessible products, through our
roll-out of our Asda Express convenience stores. See “—Convenience and Integration Strategies.” In addition to new,
standalone store concepts, we have also invested in new “shop within a shop” concepts with our Big Asda Toyshop,
which has its own merchandising and look and feel. We first trialled this concept in eight stores in 2022 and following
strong sales, we are aiming to roll it out in an additional 121 stores over the next year. We generally incur initial and
ongoing capital expenditure and pre-opening costs with each new grocery retail store and store concept.

We have also dedicated significant investment into the expansion of our online grocery channel, Asda
Groceries, our Click & Collect and ‘toyou’ parcel collection and return services, and rapid delivery services through
Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Just Eat to access new and existing customers who are increasingly shopping online, a trend
that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to continue to target operating model improvements to
our online channel supported by developments in our IT infrastructure and use data to help us better understand our

117


-----

customers. In August 2022, we rolled out our new loyalty programme, Asda Rewards nationwide, following trials in
a number of stores earlier in the year. Asda Rewards provides customers with Asda pounds instead of points for their
loyalty through an app-based scheme. Customers earn cash back on their shopping, with regularly updated missions
and star products enabling extra savings. Asda Rewards grew to almost five million active users by the end of 2023
(over the prior 30-day period) and continues to deliver strong incremental sales for the Group, while also providing
valuable insight into the shopping patterns of our customers.

**_The Online Grocery Market in the United Kingdom_**

The United Kingdom has one of the most developed online grocery retail markets in the world, with one of
the highest rates of the population using the internet. We believe it will continue to grow in the mid-term, fuelled by
consumers shifting to online channels and at-home consumption, which accelerated following the COVID-19
pandemic. We believe our growth has been, and we expect our growth to continue to be in the medium term. According
to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the second-largest online grocery retail platform in the United Kingdom, holding 19.3%
of market share (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) for the 52-week period ended January 21, 2024.

The UK online grocery market is intensely competitive. We compete with traditional grocery retailers that
are active in the online grocery retail market, including Tesco.com, Sainsburys.co.uk, Waitrose.com and
Morrisons.com, as well as with new competitors in the online grocery market, including broad-reaching e-commerce
companies such as Amazon, as well as pure online players like Ocado. In order to retain our competitiveness in the
evolving UK online grocery market, we continue to develop innovative customer solutions, such as our Express
Collection service which enables customers to place an order for collection within four hours while other grocers also
explore rapid delivery offerings (e.g., Ocado Zoom, Sainsbury’s Chop Chop). Furthermore, we continue to invest in
strategic partnerships that lead to innovation and that we believe will drive further increases in our market share, such
as our partnerships with Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo which provide express and last-mile delivery options for
convenience groceries. See “Business—Our Online Platform” and “Business—Our Tenants and Strategic Partners”
for further detail. We believe these broad-ranging online options, and in particular our in-store picking model, has
bolstered, and will continue to bolster, the performance of our online channel and our ability to adapt to shifting
consumer demands.

**_Monetisation and Accounting Treatment of Real Estate Asset Portfolio_**

We are supported by a significant freehold real estate backing from properties across the United Kingdom in
England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. As part of the financing for the EG UK Acquisition, we utilised a
portion of our real estate portfolio and entered into the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and 2023 Ground Rent
Transaction. In the future, we may continue to selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to take
advantage of favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities on attractive terms. Such transaction
would have the effect of raising our interest expenses, which would depress net income.

In accordance with IAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment), land and buildings are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Property, Plant and Equipment was recognised at fair value on
February 16, 2021 at the time of the original LBO Acquisition in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3
(Business Combinations) which for the purposes of IAS 16 represents cost. These assets have subsequently been stated
at deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Items under construction are valued at cost and
not depreciated. Depreciation is charged from the date that the assets are available for use on a straight-line basis over
the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. When an
item is disposed of or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from its continued use, any gain or loss
arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement.

**_Expanding Partnerships and Taking Advantage of New Opportunities_**

Creating a platform of partnerships has been key to reaching new customers and consistently delivering
innovative customer propositions that draw shoppers to our stores, driving increased sales in our core grocery retail
business. We have commercialised our capabilities and years of learning derived from our retail experience to partner
with various service providers who can deliver access to, among other services, new convenience and delivery
channels, where we believe there are significant opportunities to serve our customers in new and appealing ways. For
example, in 2023, we launched our first Deliveroo HOP site at the new ‘Asda Express’ convenience store in Tottenham

118


-----

Hale. Deliveroo HOP is the delivery service’s newest innovation that gives customers a speedier service and better
product availability with a model of ‘HOP’ whereby partners own and manage sites while integrating Deliveroo’s
Hop technology and leveraging Deliveroo’s logistics network.

Certain partnerships have also allowed us to focus on our omni-channel proposition or expand our non-core
grocery offerings. For example, in August 2023, we announced an exclusive collaboration with TV presenter Stacey
Solomon for a homeware range, exclusively at George Home, that expands our reach to customers in the homeware
channel across bath, bed, dining, living and accessories. In April 2022, we also launched a ‘pet zone’ in selected stores
to help consumers pick up everything from pet insurance to accessories. In November 2021, we partnered with baby
brands such as Mamas & Papas, Graco and Ickle Bubba in selected stores to expand our baby product and accessory
offerings. Additionally, we have developed partnerships with general merchandise retailers, that leverage their
authority in certain categories and will attract customers to our stores. For example, we recently expanded our
partnership with jewellery and accessories retailer, Claire’s Holdings LLC which will bring its hair, cosmetics, and
fashion accessories. We also use partnerships to elevate our brand. For example, in December 2023, we launched a
Christmas advertisement featuring guest Chief Quality Officer Michael Bublé, who is strongly associated with
Christmas and cheer. The advertisement had very positive reception, and we believe this marketing campaign is an
example of how we can drive customers to reappraise us on quality, whilst reassuring them on price, and modernising
our brand. Partnerships across our various channels will continue to be an important focus for us as we continue
looking for new ways to reach existing and new customers and to capitalise on our customers’ growing desire for
convenient lifestyles, whereby individuals seek to accomplish multiple missions at once. See “Business—Our Tenants
_and Strategic Partners” for further detail._

**_Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Information_**

The comparability of the Group’s historical financial information is impacted by a number of factors. This
section discusses key factors that the Group believes have had a material effect on the comparability of its results of
operations and financial condition during the periods under review, as well as those that are reasonably likely to have
a material effect on its results of operations and financial condition in the future.

**_Seasonality of Our Results of Operations_**

Our sales and cash flows are affected to a relatively limited extent by seasonal variations due to consumers’
shopping habits and, to a lesser extent, weather conditions. Family groups represent a significant proportion of our
customer base. As a result, our revenue has historically been comparatively higher during the Christmas and Easter
periods. In general, revenue shifts due to weather tend to be relatively short-term, with impacts occurring within a
given month, rather than across a quarter or a longer period. From time to time, we may also experience reduced sales
revenue if inclement or severe weather reduces in-store footfall and impulse purchases, without concomitant offset by
online sales. At the same time, adverse weather conditions, such as snow or flooding, can increase customer demand
for our online offerings, although they can also adversely affect our ability to deliver products to customers. In this
case, however, increased demand for online offerings would not likely offset reduced sales revenue in stores resulting
from inclement weather. In general, our fixed costs, including labour expenses (other than related to seasonal workers),
real estate leases and SG&A expenses, are more evenly distributed over the year. Additionally, our procurement and
sourcing activities are also generally more evenly spread throughout the year, except for a build-up in preparation for
the Christmas season and to a lesser extent a build-up in preparation for Easter in April. While our financial calendar
generally aligns with our operational profile, we experience calendar effects when, for example, the number of trading
days or payroll periods in a given period varies from period to period or year to year or certain holidays fall in different
periods from year to year. As a result of the foregoing, comparisons of consecutive interim periods may not be a good
indication of our performance, and the calendar effects we experience may have an impact on year-on-year
comparisons of interim periods.

**_Asda Group Pension Scheme Buy-In_**

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the trustees of the Asda Group Pension Scheme entered into an
agreement for a bulk annuity insurance buy-in of the Asda Group Pension Scheme with Rothesay Life. The agreement
was entered into with Rothesay Life, and insures the long-term benefits of approximately 12,300 members of the Asda
Group Pension Scheme. The buy-in transaction, which was enabled by a one-off final contribution by Asda of £0.7
billion and a loan facility made available by the Asda Group Pension Scheme’s sponsor, Asda Stores Limited (see

119


-----

below), has taken place ahead of a full scheme-buy-out that was completed in July 2021. The transaction removed
future Asda Group Pension Scheme liabilities from the Asda balance sheet, simplifying the business. The buy-out
means Asda Group Pension Scheme members have received an individual annuity policy, issued by Rothesay Life,
which will pay members’ pension benefits in full.

At the time of the buy-in, it was agreed that certain of the assets of the Asda Group Pension Scheme did not
meet the criteria for transfer to Rothesay Life pursuant to the buy-in transaction and were retained by the Asda Group
Pension Scheme (the “Illiquid Assets”). The sponsor of the scheme, Asda Stores Limited, agreed to make a loan
facility available to the trustees in an aggregate principal amount of £467.0 million in 2019 with the principal purpose
of providing liquidity to the Asda Group Pension Scheme to allow the trustees to pay the premium in full under the
buy-in policy with Rothesay Life, and also to provide prudent reserves that are available to fund the operation of the
Asda Group Pension Scheme up to completion of the buy-out and eventual winding-up (the “Pension Scheme
**Expenses”). The loan facility was set up on arm’s-length terms, including in relation to interest. Since completion of**
the buy-in transaction any proceeds realised in respect of the Illiquid Assets have been required to be applied by the
trustees to fund interest and principal payments under the loan facility, to the extent such proceeds are not required to
be retained to maintain prudent reserves with respect to the Pension Scheme Expenses. Pursuant to arrangements
agreed in connection with the LBO Acquisition Agreement, payments received by Asda Stores Limited under the loan
facility that are attributable to the Illiquid Assets are required to be paid to Walmart. Accordingly, the risk and reward
of the performance of the Illiquid Assets was effectively transferred to Walmart. To the extent that realisations from
the Illiquid Assets are insufficient to cover interest and principal payments owing to Asda Stores Limited under the
loan facility, Asda Stores Limited is obliged under a separate agreement to provide sufficient funding to the Asda
Group Pension Scheme to enable the trustees to fund such shortfall. As the amount of such funding provided by Asda
Stores Limited to the Asda Group Pension Scheme would be applied to repay the loan facility owing to Asda Stores
Limited, the combined effect of such transactions would have no net impact on Asda Stores Limited. Asda Stores
Limited reached an agreement with the trustees of the Asda Group Pension Scheme to make a cash contribution of
£214.6 million to the Asda Group Pension Scheme on December 30, 2020. Such amount was applied to repay amounts
due to Asda Stores Limited under the loan facility on the same day.

On July 9, 2021, the trustees of the Asda Group Pension Scheme completed the full buy-out of the Asda
Group Pension Scheme with Rothesay Life. Following this transaction, from the date of the buy-out, Rothesay Life
has become directly responsible for the Asda Group Pension Scheme liabilities and as such, the Asda Group Pension
Scheme assets and Scheme liabilities (except for a pension liability of £0.5 million, which has continued to be
accounted for as pension liabilities in line with the requirements of IAS 19 (Employee Benefits)) were derecognised
in the Group balance sheet from July 9, 2021. From the date of the buy-out, the outstanding balance on the buy-in
loan referred to above has been accounted for as a financial asset in line with the requirements of IFRS 9 (Financial
_Instruments). Any differences between the fair value of the buy-in loan and the pension asset at the date of the buy-in_
has been accounted for as a loss or gain within the other comprehensive income statement or the income statement
depending on their nature. We do not anticipate material amounts to be recognised in respect of these differences
individually or in aggregate.

The remaining liabilities with respect to the Asda Group Pension Scheme were settled in the year to
December 31, 2023. The carrying value of liabilities associated the Asda Group Pension Scheme at December 31,
2023 is £nil, compared to £0.5 million in at December 31, 2022.

**_The Acquisition Transactions_**

We consolidate the results of operations of any acquired business in our financial statements from the
acquisition date. The acquisition date is the date when the Group obtains control of the acquired business as defined
by IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, our historical financial periods are not directly comparable
to one another. For example, following the closing date of the EG UK Acquisition on October 31, 2023, the results of
EG UK were consolidated into our results. Following the closing of the Arthur Acquisition in October 2022, the CMA
implemented an IEO and consequently, management concluded that the restrictions imposed by the IEO meant that
the Group did not obtain control of the Arthur Business at the closing date. On May 30, 2023, after accepting our
proposed remedies of disposing of 13 of the acquired sites, the CMA lifted the IEO and the results of the Arthur
Business were consolidated into our results from that date. Our results in 2023 have been impacted by the revenues
and expenses of the acquired business starting from the relevant date when we started consolidated the results of the
applicable acquired business, whereas prior comparative periods do not include the results of the acquired business.

-----

Moreover, if we incur additional debt or enter into new financing arrangements in connection with any acquisition,
our financial condition and results of operations will be impacted such instruments and may differ from the historical
financial condition and results of operations presented in this discussion. For example, on October 31, 2023, we
completed the EG UK Acquisition, which was also funded, among others, with the proceeds of external indebtedness,
including the Private Placement Facility and the America Bridge Loan, the latter of which was subsequently refinanced
with the proceeds from the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of
operations following the EG UK Acquisition were, and will be, impacted by debt interest costs and rental expenses
and may differ from the historical financial condition and results of operations presented in this discussion.

In addition, all historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Senior
Notes Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, the financial results of the Senior Notes Issuer do not include
a full year of trading in the year ended December 31, 2021, as it acquired the trading group Asda Group Limited part
way through the year on February 16, 2021. As a result, results for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the Senior
Notes Issuer consolidated group do not constitute a full comparative period.

In certain instances, to provide a more meaningful comparison, the results for the year ended December 31,
2021 down to the level of operating profit are presented on an annualised basis as if Asda Group Limited had been
acquired by the Senior Notes Issuer on January 1, 2021. Such annualised results are derived from the financial
statements of Bellis Finco plc for the period ended December 31, 2021 and the actual results of Asda Group Limited
from January 1, 2021 to the date of acquisition of Asda Group by Bellis Finco plc on February, 14 2021.

The table below provides a reconciliation from the audited Asda Group Limited Consolidated Financial
Statements for the year ended December 31, 2021 to annualised results for the Senior Notes Issuer.

Other ..................................................................................................................... 94 79 205

**_Other Income_**

Other income consists of income from concessions and commissions and rental income earned by the Group
as a lessor that comes from sources other than sale of goods and fuel.

**_Reimbursement Income_**

Reimbursement relates to a reimbursed settlement relating to historical tax reliefs, the gain on bargain
purchase of Asda Group Limited by the Senior Notes Issuer and the gain on 2021 Sale and Leaseback Transactions.

**_Operating costs_**

Operating costs include costs, other than finance costs and tax. The largest components of operating costs are
cost of goods sold (net of supplier rebates), employment costs, depreciation and amortisation, property costs including
business rates, utilities, marketing costs, distribution costs, maintenance expenses, consumables, store suppliers,
interchange fees and IT costs (including the costs of Project Future and charges under the TSA payable to Walmart).
For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating costs also included income (of which the most significant is income
from recycling of certain categories of waste) other than revenue, other income and finance income.

**_Finance income and finance costs_**

Finance income consists of bank interest receivable and interest receivable on amounts owed from fellow
subsidiary undertakings of the ultimate parent of the Group. Finance costs consist of external interest payable, interest
on lease liabilities, interest payable on amounts owed to fellow subsidiary undertakings of the ultimate parent of the
Group, asset retirement obligations discount unwind and net interest cost on the Asda Group’s defined benefit pension
schemes. External interest payable includes interest on external debt issued by the Group during the current year and
prior period, amortisation of fees incurred in relation to external debt and commitment fees and interest relating to the
Original Revolving Facility.

**_Income tax expense_**

Income tax expense comprises current taxation, including UK corporation tax and a UK corporation tax
adjustment to prior periods, as well as deferred taxation, including deferred taxation arising from the origination and

122

reversal of temporary differences, from changes in tax rates and laws, and from previously unrecognised tax losses,
tax credits or any temporary differences in prior periods.

**_Non-underlying items_**

Non-underlying items represent amounts that are not underlying to the Group’s financial performance.
Certain amounts have been presented in the consolidated income statement as non-underlying by virtue of their size
and nature.

_For the year ended December 31, 2023_

The consolidated income statement impact of these items is as follows:

**Year ended December 31, 2023**

**Pre-tax** **Post-tax**
**increase/** **(Increase)/** **increase/**

**Total ..................................................................................................................................** **(68.0)** **(14.2)** **(53.8)**

(1) Relates to third-party advisory fees incurred during the year in respect of the EG UK Acquisition.

(2) Since the LBO Acquisition, the Group has embarked on a programme, Project Future, to separate its IT systems from its previous owner
Walmart. The separation programme will transition the Group to a standalone, leading edge IT infrastructure which will enable it to improve
operating efficiencies, make better use of data, improve its experience for customers and colleagues, and enable the business to be more agile
in responding to customers’ needs. Amounts classified as non-underlying during the current year and prior year relate to costs incurred outside
the normal course of business in respect of research spend, design and build costs relating to IT infrastructure and SAAS solutions which
cannot be capitalised, consultancy costs incurred in relation to the management of the programme, run costs relating to standalone systems
where equivalent legacy Walmart systems are still in use by the business, and costs of interim software solutions which do not meet the criteria
of the Group’s policy to capitalise. Where legacy Walmart systems are still in use, the costs of these are included in charges relating to the
TSA. The total IT spend included in underlying operating costs reflects management’s expectation of the level of annual spend required to
operate the business on standalone IT systems in the normal course of business, which includes the charges incurred under the TSA and a
proportion of Project Future costs.

The impacts of the above items on the consolidated pre-tax cash flows of the Group are as follows:

**Year ended December 31, 2023**

**Increase/** **Increase/**

Transaction costs relating to the EG UK Acquisition[(2)] ......................................................... (16.4) — (16.4)

(258.0) (34.4) (292.4)

(1) Operating cash flows in relation to Project Future costs are as per the amounts expensed in the consolidated Income Statement adjusted for
related prepayments and accruals which were outstanding on December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. Investing cash flows relate to
Project Future-related amounts incurred in the current and prior year which have been capitalised as intangible assets.

(2) Cash flows in relation to transaction costs relating to the EG UK Acquisition are as per the amounts expensed in the consolidated Income
Statement adjusted for accruals which were outstanding on December 31, 2023.

(2) Reimbursed settlement relating to historic tax reliefs: The Group’s tax and interest liabilities to the tax authorities arising out of settlement of
this matter were settled in full in the prior year by a fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent of Asda Holdings UK Limited
(“AHUKL,” the former immediate parent of Asda Group Limited). This satisfied AHUKL’s obligations to the Group arising out of this matter
as set out in the sale and purchase agreement relating to the Group’s acquisition of Asda and as such, there were no cashflow impacts on the
Group during the prior year or current year.

proportion of the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor during the prior period. The remaining gain of £564.6m was
deferred on the balance sheet and is recorded as a reduction to the right-of-use assets relating to the leaseback.

_Revenue_

Revenue (including fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £25,616.9 million, an increase of
£1,139.1 million, or 4.7%, compared to £24,477.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was
due to growth in non-fuel sales, partly offset by an overall decline in fuel sales revenue, a result of the comparatively
lower average selling price in 2023 compared to high and volatile prices in 2022.

Revenue (excluding fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £21,898.4 million, an increase of
£1,446.1 million, or 7.1%, compared to £20,452.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was
primarily a result of growing revenue across both food and non-food in the existing Asda business, whilst also
reflecting the additional sales from the Arthur Business and the EG UK Business. The Group recorded particularly
strong year on year growth in the first half of 2023, by comparison to the first half of 2022, as a result of the impact
of weaker performance in the first half of 2022, following emergence from COVID-19 lockdowns and supply chain
challenges. Sales in the second half of 2023 showed more modest growth, partly due to unseasonable weather in the
summer and autumn, which impacted customer behaviour and created unpredictability, particularly in seasonal
categories, which was partially offset by positive impacts following the launch of Asda Rewards in August 2022.

Further commentary below provides detail on the performance of our key categories.

_Food_

Food sales increased in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to year ended December 31, 2022,
including impact of sales from the acquired businesses.

The Group has continued to invest in its food proposition in 2023, building on the success of the launch of
the Just Essentials opening price point range in 2022. Value remains a key priority, including the aim to pass along
the benefits of commodity price deflation where it has occurred and reflecting significant investment in our key
supplier relationships. Nevertheless, sales performance in 2023 continues to reflect the pass through of the significant
commodity price inflation which has occurred over the past two years.

The Group has continued to invest in driving quality improvement across our own-brand mid-tier offering.
Following refreshes to the Group’s produce, meat fish and poultry, and bakery in 2021 and 2022, the Group has
overhauled its core chilled, meal solutions, and cooking ingredients ranges in 2023. These categories are key signifiers
of quality and are central to the Group’s strategic priority to make desirable products affordable, giving customers a
reason to reappraise Asda’s offering. The Group has also launched a selection of premium sub-brands, including two
vegan-friendly ranges, Plant Based, a healthy, balanced selection of meat-free lines, and OMV!, an indulgent vegan
range, as well as ranges to rival takeaway offerings and key competitor prepared food ranges. These include, our
popular Bistro, Take Out and House of Yum ranges. The Group also launched some ambitious quality and taste match
campaigns during the year, including an M&S quality match across a range of popular items.

_Non-food_

Non-food sales grew slightly in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to year ended December 31,
2022 on a like-for-like basis and were particularly strong in the first half of 2023, in both clothing and general
merchandise. Across both clothing and general merchandise, the third quarter was particularly impacted by the
unseasonal weather, but rebounded to like for like growth in the fourth quarter of 2023.

_Online_

Online sales comprise Asda.com grocery sales and non-food sales through George.com. Online grocery is a
key strength of the Group, where it held the number two grocery market share position throughout 2023, and online
is a key element of Asda’s omnichannel retail offering, fostering strong customer loyalty and typically larger spend
per basket. The proportion of sales made through online delivery and click and collect was slightly higher in 2023.

_Fuel_

Fuel sales were £3,719 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 7.6% as compared to
£4,026 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. A decrease in the Asda legacy business’ fuel sales was
predominantly due to the lower average selling price of fuel in 2023 compared to 2022, which saw record and volatile
commodity prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This was partly offset by the additional fuel sales from the
acquired businesses.

_Foodservice_

The Group acquired 419 food service outlets in the EG UK Business, comprising franchises of brands
including Greggs, Subway and Burger King, as well as one proprietary brand Leon. Food service sales of £40 million
were recorded in 2023 following the completion of the EG UK Acquisition. We believe that the addition of foodservice
to Asda’s portfolio is a strong strategic fit and complements our omni-channel retail offering, with further opportunity
for growth and synergies within the store estate.

_Other income_

Other income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £70.9 million, an increase of £1.1 million, or 1.6%,
compared to £69.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily a result of slightly
increased rental income for the year ended December 31, 2022.

_Operating costs_

Operating costs post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2023 were £25,119.2 million, an
increase of £430.9 million, or 1.7%, compared to £24,688.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase
was primarily a result of increases in the cost of goods sold as a result of higher sales, year-on-year increases in
inventory losses, investments in colleague pay and a year-on-year increase in Project Future costs, as well as additional
transaction costs relating to the EG UK Acquisition in the year ended December 31, 2023.

_Finance income_

Finance income post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £52.5 million, a decrease
of £2.9 million, or 5.2%, compared to £55.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily
due to a £23.0 million decrease in interest receivable from a fellow subsidiary of the ultimate parent, after an exercise
to settle intercompany loan receivables and payables was carried out in September 2022. This decrease was partially
offset by a £20.6 million increase in bank interest receivable, driven by an increase in interest rates on short-term
deposits, and higher average cash balances. This included the impact of £646 million of net proceeds in respect of the
Sale and Leaseback Transaction, the majority of which was received approximately 11 weeks in advance of the
completion of the EG UK Acquisition.

-----

_Finance costs_

Finance costs post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2023 were £440.8 million, an increase
of £45.3 million, or 11.5%, compared to £395.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was
primarily due to higher costs on external borrowings, including 10 months’ worth of interest charged on the £200
million facility used in connection with the Arthur Acquisition at a rate of SONIA + 7.75bps, which was repaid in
October 2023, compared to two months’ charged in the 2022; two months’ worth of interest on the Private Placement
Facility at a rate of SONIA + 6.75bps entered into to fund the EG UK Acquisition; and two months’ worth of interest
on the America Bridge Loan at a rate of SONIA + 7.00bps entered into to fund the EG UK Acquisition. The America
Bridge Loan was repaid in December 2023 upon completion of the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction. Interest on lease
liabilities also increased to £177 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to £146 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the interest on leases which were entered into as a result of the Sale and
Leaseback Transaction. These increases were partly offset by a reduction in intercompany interest payable to a fellow
subsidiary of the ultimate parent following the intercompany loan settlement exercise in September 2022 referred to
under finance income above.

_Reimbursement income_

Reimbursement income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was nil, compared to £49.3 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a reimbursed settlement relating to historical tax reliefs
in the year ended December 31, 2022.

_Income tax credit/(expense)_

Income tax credit post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £14.2 million, a decrease
of £63.4 million, or 81.7%, compared to a tax credit of £77.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This was
due to increased amounts of deferred taxation in the year ended December 31, 2022.

_Cash flow forward contracts reclassification during the period to income statement_

Cash flow forward contracts reclassification during the period to income statement for the year ended
December 31, 2023 amounted to a gain reclassified to the income statement of £15.3 million, a change of £38.7 million
compared to a loss reclassified to the income statement of £23.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This
change was due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase
U.S. dollars and the settling of those forward contracts that occurred in the relevant period. The gain reclassified to
the income statement in the year ended December 31, 2023 is a result of the GBP weakening versus the USD over the
average forward contract life, whereas the loss reclassified to the income statement in the year ended December 31,
2022 is a result of the GBP strengthening versus the USD over the average forward contract life.

_Cash flow forward contracts net gain/(loss) during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts_

Cash flow forward contracts net loss during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts for the year ended
December 31, 2023 amounted to £36.3. million, a change of £50.7 million compared to a net gain of £14.4 million in
the year ended December 31, 2022. This change was primarily due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate
between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars in each financial year and the value of those contracts
not settled at the end of the year based on the exchange rate at the end of the year.

_Tax on cash flow forward contracts recognised directly in other comprehensive income_

Tax on cash flow forward contracts recognised directly in other comprehensive income for the year ended
December 31, 2023 was a credit of £5.2 million, an increase of £3.7 million compared to a credit of £1.5 million in
the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase in this credit was due to net loss on cash flow forward contracts in
2023 compared to 2022 as described above.

_Other comprehensive (expense)/income_

Other comprehensive expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to an expense of £39.5
million, a change of £50.5 million compared to income £11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This

129


-----

change was primarily due to an increase in items to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result of
cash flow hedges as described above.

(1) Following restatement of certain financial information for the year ended December 31, 2022 in the 2023 Financial Statements, “other income”
is presented below “revenue” in the consolidated income statement. For the year ended December 31, 2021, it remains as it was presented in
the 2021 Financial Statements, which have not been restated. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Certain Restatements
_and Reclassifications.”_

Unless otherwise specified, all results presented below for the year ended December 31, 2021 are on an actual
basis, rather than annualized to reflect a full twelve months of trading. See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of
_Operations—The Acquisition Transactions.”_

_Revenue_

Revenue (including fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £24,477.8 million, an increase of £989
million, or 4.2%, compared to £23,489 million on an annualised basis for the year ended December 31, 2021. Actual
revenue (including fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was £20,710.4 million. This increase was primarily
due to higher fuel prices in the year driven by inflation in oil prices, and higher fuel volume sales following lockdowns
in the year ended December 31, 2021 impacting travel.

Revenue (excluding fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £20,452 million, an increase of £28
million, or 0.1%, compared to £20,424 million on an annualised basis for the year ended December 31, 2021. Actual
revenue (excluding fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was £17,900 million. Revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2022 was broadly in line with the prior year. Performance in the first half of 2022 was challenging. In
the context of growing inflation and cost of living pressures and exceptional sales in 2021 during COVID-19
lockdowns, we experienced a decline in like-for-like sales and some loss of market share. Performance recovered in
the second half of the year and showed strong growth, driven by new initiatives to drive strategic objectives, including
launching Dropped and Locked prices, Just Essentials and Asda Rewards. Market share recovered in the second half
of the year and the total number of customer transactions increased.

Further commentary below provides detail on the performance of our key categories.

_Food_

In the first six months of the year ended December 31, 2022 we experienced like-for-like decline in sales due
to the tailwind from COVID-19 related lockdowns in 2021 which led to an increase in at-home grocery consumption.
The lockdown was in place for the majority of the first quarter of 2021, with some restrictions continuing into the

130


-----

second quarter of 2021 and beyond. We also experienced loss of market share over the first six months of the year
ended December 31, 2022 which further contributed to like-for-like sales declines.

From the second quarter of 2022 onwards, we experienced an improvement in sales momentum and recorded
positive like-for-like results for the second half of the year. Food sales were boosted following the launch of Asda’s
Dropped and Locked price campaign, which locked prices for customers in light of cost-of-living pressures. The
campaign saw prices of a wide selection of family favourite products dropped and locked until the end of the year to
give customers certainty around their shopping. In May 2022, Asda launched its new opening price point own brand
range, Just Essentials by Asda. The range replaced Asda Smart Price, with new branding and products reformulated
for taste and quality, doubling the number of items in the range and providing all the products customers need to keep
the household running on a budget.

Throughout the year ended December 31, 2022, we also continued our investment in mid-tier own-brand
ranges. Following on from refreshing the produce range in the year ended December 31, 2021, we overhauled our
bakery and meat, fish and poultry categories including expanding the range of products, improving the quality and
refreshing the packaging. These categories are key signifiers of quality and are central to our strategic priority to make
desirable products affordable, giving customers a reason to reappraise our offering and contributing to strong
like-for-like sales growth in food in the last six months of year ended December 31, 2022.

In August 2022, we rolled out our new loyalty programme Asda Rewards nationwide, following successful
trials in a number of stores since the start of the year. Asda Rewards provides customers with Asda pounds, not points,
for their loyalty through an app-based scheme. Customers earn cash back on their shopping, with regularly updated
missions and star products enabling extra savings.

_Non-food_

In non-food sales, performance in the second quarter of 2022 was similarly lower than the comparative period
in 2021 when we benefited from non-essential retail stores being closed during COVID-19 lockdowns. Sales in both
clothing and general merchandise were also impacted by supply chain challenges from the fourth quarter of 2021
which led to the wrong stock being in place in the early part of the year. Direction provided by new leadership
contributed to significant improvement in sales momentum in the second quarter of 2022, in particular following the
Queen Elizabeth’s Jubilee Weekend, when our proposition appealed strongly to customers and we delivered new
relevant product. In the third quarter of 2022, clothing grew ahead of the market, with particular strengths in women’s
wear and back to school sales, supported by improvements in merchandising and in-store shopping experience
following reopening fitting rooms after COVID-19-related closures. In the fourth quarter of 2022, clothing sales were
impacted by availability challenges resulting which arose during a major system upgrade. Some issues with the transfer
to the new system led to challenges in visibility and allocating stock, preventing product from being distributed around
the store network appropriately; however, sales recovered in December 2022 following resolution of these issues and
have since continued in positive growth in line with expectations.

In General Merchandise, the George Home range delivered strong performance in the second half of the year
ended December 31, 2022, offering an affordable and stylish proposition to customers. Highlights included summer
outdoor and seasonal ranges, with particular growth in energy-saving and winter products to support customers
through the cost of living and energy crisis in the fourth quarter of 2022.

_Online_

We have a strong market position in grocery home shopping, with around 16% of our food sales coming
through online channels in the year ended December 31, 2022 (including home delivery and click and collect services).
Online continues to be a key part of our omni-channel strategy to enable customers to shop wherever and however
they choose. Online sales stabilised in the year ended December 31, 2022 following considerable growth in the channel
during the COVID-19 pandemic; total online sales for the full year were slightly lower than the prior year and lower
as a proportion of total sales, as more customers returned to shopping instore. We continue to invest in ways to optimise
the online experience for customers, focusing on availability, range and service.

_Other income_

Other income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £69.8 million, a decrease of £2,863.6 million,
compared to £2,933.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the gain on
bargain purchase of the Asda Group Limited by the Senior Notes Issuer of £2,654 million, and the gain on sale and
leaseback of the warehouse assets of £279 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, which was not repeated in
the year ended December 31, 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2022 other income was primarily related to rental
income and concession and commission income.

_Operating costs_

Operating costs post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2022 were £24,688.3 million, an
increase of £4,425.8 million, or 21.8%, compared to £20,262.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This
increase was primarily due to significant increase in inflation across our cost base, partially offset to a certain extent
by cost saving initiatives such as bringing cleaning in-house from a third-party supplier, delivering operating
efficiencies in our stores and depots and reduction in COVID-19-related costs.

There has been a significant increase in supply side inflation in the year ended December 31, 2022, in
particular following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Labour shortages, investment in colleague wages, increases in
energy and fuel cost inflation have driven higher cost prices in our supply base and in our own cost base. In our
non-food business, margins were also impacted by significant increases in freight, detention and demurrage costs as
the global economy emerged from the pandemic, exacerbated by further lockdowns in China, and adverse movements
in foreign exchange rates following the UK mini-budget in September 2022. In the selling, general and administrative
cost base, we also saw notable cost increases which impacted profitability. These cost increases included energy costs
for operating our stores, depots and offices and fuel costs in running our logistics and online operations. We also
incurred additional exceptional costs in the year ended December 31, 2022 relating to our investment in Project Future,
and transaction costs incurred in connection with the LBO Acquisition.

_Finance income_

Finance income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £55.4 million, an increase of £26.0 million, or
88%, compared to £29.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to
approximately ten months’ interest being earned on the intercompany receivable balance which arose out of the 2021
Sale and Leaseback Transactions, compared to approximately six months’ interest in the year ended December 31,
2021.

_Finance costs_

Finance costs post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2022 were £395.5 million, an increase
of £20.4 million, or 5%, compared to £375.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily
due to an increase of £40 million in interest payable on lease liabilities reflecting a full year of interest being recorded
in relation to the 2021 Sale and Leaseback Transactions which was largely completed in June 2021. This increase was
partially offset by a reduction of £11 million in external interest payable driven primarily by settlement of the
Forecourt Bridge Facility in November 2021 and a reduction of £8 million in intercompany interest payable driven by
settlement of an amount owing to our immediate parent company during the year ended December 31, 2022.

_Reimbursement income_

Reimbursement income post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £49.3 million
compared to nil in the year ended December 31, 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2022 reimbursement income
was primarily related to a reimbursed settlement relating to historical tax reliefs.

_Income tax credit/(expense)_

Income tax post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2022 was a credit of £77.6 million, from
an expense of £245.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to a prior period
deferred tax charge of £281 million arising from an increase in the headline corporation tax rate which was

132


-----

substantively enacted in May 2021. This change was partially offset by a one-off net credit in 2021 of £74 million
relating to the 2021 Sale and Leaseback Transactions.

_Cash flow forward contracts reclassification during the period to income statement_

Cash flow forward contracts reclassification during the year to income statement for the year ended
December 31, 2022 amounted to a loss of £23.4 million, a change of £65.7 million compared to a gain of £42.3 million
in the year ended December 31, 2021. This change was due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between
entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars and the settling of those forward contracts that occurred in the
relevant period: losses were caused by the GBP strengthening versus the USD over the year of forward contracts,
resulting in the contracts being “out of the money.” The loss in the year ended December 31, 2022 is a result of the
GBP strengthening versus the USD over the average forward contract life, whereas the gain in the year ended
December 31, 2021 is a result of the pounds sterling weakening versus the USD over the average forward contract
life.

_Cash flow forward contracts net (loss)/gain during the year of the not-yet-matured contracts_

Cash flow forward contracts net gain during the year of the not-yet-matured contracts for the year ended
December 31, 2022 amounted to £11.6 million, a change of £2.8 million compared to a net gain of £14.4 million in
the year ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to fluctuations in the USD/ pounds sterling
exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars in each financial year and the value of
those contracts not settled at the end of the year based on the exchange rate at the end of the year.

_Tax on cash flow forward contracts recognised directly in other comprehensive income_

Tax on cash flow forward contracts recognised directly in other comprehensive income for the year ended
December 31, 2022 was an expense of £10.2 million, a change of £11.7 million compared to a credit of £1.5 million
in the year ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to the reduction of the net gain on cash flow
hedges in 2022 compared to 2021 as described above.

_Other comprehensive (expense)/income_

Other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to £11.0 million, a change of
£30.1 million compared to an income of £41.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was
primarily due to a decrease in items to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result in cash flow
hedges as described above and our forward contracts.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

Our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is expected to be our operating cash flows and
borrowings under our New Revolving Facility. Our cash-generative business, due to the nature of the grocery industry,
together with our relatively low capital expenditure, has driven cash flow generation, including comparatively high
unlevered free cash flow.

Our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which, in turn, depends to some
extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. See “Risk
_Factors.” We are a structurally negative working capital business driven by growth in payables, and the beneficial_
payment terms to suppliers versus payments received by consumers instantly on purchase. In 2023, we increased our
focus on cash management, particularly related to working capital. We delivered a very strong net working capital
performance in 2022 and 2023, with our active working capital management resulting in increased working capital
inflows in those two years. These improvements in net working capital were driven partly through key supplier partner
negotiations related to the deferral of cash payables. Stock was also more tightly managed and we began to see a more
favourable trajectory for fuel price and volume.

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings under
our New Revolving Facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated working capital and general corporate needs for
the next 12 months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities

or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due,
including the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, or to fund our other liquidity needs. The availability of our New
Revolving Facility is dependent upon certain conditions, including compliance with a springing maintenance covenant
as described further under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement.”

until the CMA lifted the IEO on May 30, 2023.

_Cash flows from/(used in) operating activities_

Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by £69.0 million, to
£1,245.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from £1,176.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022.
Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 included a net working capital inflow of
£223 million. This inflow was driven principally by an increase in trade and other payables of £281 million due to
working capital improvement initiatives and payment timing benefits relating to weekly supplier payments and
payroll. The increase was partially offset by an increase in trade and other receivables of £32 million due to an increase
in supplier income and in inventory of £13 million driven by investment to improve availability, partially offset by
prior year inventory build in non-food which followed a new system implementation in our George brand in 2022.

Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by £254.80 million, to
£1,176.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from £922.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021.
This increase was primarily due to an increase in trade and other payables of £408 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022, due to strong like-for-like sales growth in the fourth quarter, improvements in supplier payment
terms and favourable timing impacts of supplier payment runs relative to the year-end date. The increase was partly
offset by an increase in inventory of £109 million, driven in part by inflationary cost increases, as well as a proactive
decision to build the inventory position to protect availability.

_Cash flows (used in)/ from in investing activities_

Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by £1,285.1 million,
or 163.0%, to £2,073.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from £788.6 million for the year ended
December 31, 2022. This increase included the £2,000 million consideration paid for the EG UK Acquisition in 2023,
as well as the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles of £337 million. This increase was partially
offset by a proportion of the proceeds from the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transaction of £136 million and cash acquired
on consolidation of the EG UK Business and the Arthur Business of £31 million and £36 million, respectively

Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by £5,513.5 million,
or 87.5%, to an outflow of £788.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from an outflow of £6,302.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due the cash consideration paid for the LBO
Acquisition in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the cash flows used in investing activities in the year
ended December 31, 2022, which were comprised primarily of purchase of property, plant and equipment and
intangibles of £320 million (see “—Capital Expenditure”) and a cash outflow related to the Arthur Acquisition of
£424 million (of which £200 million was funded through debt and the remainder from cash on balance sheet, net of
£5 million bank fees).

_Cash flows from/(used in) financing activities_

Cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 changed by £1,424.3 million, to
an inflow of £1,193.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from an outflow of £231.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily due to the proceeds from the draw down of external debt (net
of fees) of £1,304 million in 2023, a proportion of the proceeds from the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions of
£509 million and an increase in intercompany payables of £401 million, partially offset by the repayment of external
debt of £500 million (including the America Bridge Loan), £188 million of interest payments on external debt and
capital and interest payments of £324 million in respect of leases.

Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by £6,116.80 million
from an inflow of £5,885.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to an outflow of £231.2 million for the year
ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by proceeds from a drawdown of £4,920.6 million of
external debt in the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the LBO Acquisition, compared to net cash outflows
used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022, which were primarily comprised of £(231) million
from the drawdown on a corporate facility of £200 million to finance the Arthur Acquisition (net of £5 million bank
fees), £150 million of interest payments on external debt and capital and interest payments of £277 million in respect
of leases.

**_New Revolving Facility_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement shall, with effect on and from the Issue Date, provide for the multi-currency
senior secured New Revolving Facility in an aggregate amount at least £747,722,727 (with a possible incremental
commitment of £45,000,000 under the New Revolving Facility, which could be made available on or shortly after the
Issue Date). The New Revolving Facility may be utilised by any Original Revolving Facility Borrower or Additional
Revolving Facility Borrower (subject to certain exceptions) under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Pursuant to the
terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, a Lender may also provide Letters of Credit, Fronted Ancillary Facilities or
Ancillary Facilities (in each case as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) on a bilateral basis in place of all or
part of its Revolving Facility Commitment (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement).

Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, loans made under the New Revolving Facility may
be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time. Such loans will be available to be used for, amongst other purposes,
general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) and,
without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, to fund certain permitted acquisitions and capital expenditure and
to backstop existing ancillary facilities, letters of credit and/or hedging arrangements of the Group.

The Group is subject to certain customary affirmative, negative and incurrence covenants under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, which impose restrictions on, among other things, incurrence of other debt, making restricted
payments, disposal of assets and granting of security, subject to certain agreed exceptions and permissions,
qualifications and thresholds. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

The New Revolving Facility is expected to be undrawn at the Issue Date and the Original Revolving Facility
has been undrawn since the first quarter of 2022.

**_Supply Chain Financing Facilities_**

The Group offers suppliers the option to access uncommitted supply chain financing through certain thirdparty providers. These facilities allow suppliers to receive payments earlier than its standard payment terms and for
the Group to defer its own payments. The total size of our supply chain financing facilities as of December 31, 2023
was £575.1 million across a number of banks and platforms. The level of utilisation is dependent on the individual
supplier requirements and varies significantly over time, dependent on suppliers’ requirements. The following table
shows the utilisation of our supply chain financing facilities for the periods indicated:

**_Capital Expenditure_**

The Group typically has relatively low capital expenditure requirements. Capital expenditure has on average
amounted to 1.5% of sales (including fuel) between the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2023.
Capital expenditure as disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows is the sum of the purchase of property,
plant and equipment and purchase of intangible assets. We also use Capital Expenditure KPI as a key performance
indicator, which is defined as the total costs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of which the Group
takes ownership within a financial period (as opposed to the UK IFRS measurement of capital expenditure which is
based on cash flows). It excludes capital expenditure on Project Future, our investment to separate from Walmart’s IT
systems, since it is one-off and non-recurring in nature. For a reconciliation from Capital Expenditure KPI to capital
expenditure as disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows see “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial
_Information and Other Financial Data–Other Financial Indicators.” See also, “Presentation of Financial and Other_
_Information—Non-IFRS Financial Measures.”_

We categorise our capital expenditure as essential, which includes capital expenditure for things such as
essential asset replacement and maintenance, discretionary, which includes capital expenditure for things such as store
upgrades and investment in systems to improve efficiency, or for Project Future. The following table presents a
breakdown of our essential, discretionary and Project Future capital expenditures.

**Year ended December 31,**

**2021** **2022** **2023**

**(in £ millions)**
Essential .................................................................................................... 203 166 173
Discretionary ............................................................................................ 217 110 129
Project Future[ ................................................................................................................................................ ]   - 49 34

**Capital expenditure (excluding timing difference) .............................** **420** **325** **337**

(A) Capital expenditure (excluding timing differences) does not include timing differences of £(17) million, £6 million and £(0.3) million
for the years ended December 2021, 2022 and 2023. There are timing differences resulting from internal capital expenditure being
presented on an accruals basis.

During the year ended December 31, 2023 Capital Expenditure KPI was £302 million and capital expenditure
was £337 million. The underlying spend was £320 million, consistent with the year ended December 31, 2022, with
£16 million attributed to investment in the EG UK Business and Arthur Business, primarily on store conversions to
the Asda Express brand. Approximately 51% of the Group’s investment in the year ended December 31, 2023 was on
essential asset replacement and maintenance, including replacement of store refrigeration units and property
maintenance costs, and 38% was focused on discretionary spend to drive growth, including upgrades to store
environment and investment in systems to improve efficiency of operations. The remaining 11% was invested in

136


-----

Project Future, comprising investment in the detailed design, build and implementation of Asda’s standalone IT
environment as we separate from previous owner Walmart’s IT systems.

During the year ended December 31, 2022 Capital Expenditure KPI was £277 million. Approximately 53%
of the Group’s investment in the year ended December 31, 2022 was on essential asset replacement and maintenance,
including replacement of store refrigeration units and property maintenance costs, and 32% was focused on
discretionary spend to drive growth, including upgrades to store environment and investment in systems to improve
efficiency of operations. The remaining 15%, or £49 million, was invested in Project Future, comprising investment
in the detailed design and initial build phase of the Group’s standalone IT environment as we separate from previous
owner Walmart’s IT systems.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, capital expenditure focused principally on replacing essential
assets and refreshing our store estate, as well as investments in self-checkouts and our online proposition.

Our capital expenditure requirements vary from year to year based on, among other factors, specific
reinvestment requirements in relation to our sites and specific initiatives to develop our technologies, and as such, we
cannot assure you that our level of capital expenditure will not increase significantly in the future.

For the year ended December 31, 2024 we expect our capital expenditure to amount to between £450 million
and £470 million, including Project Future. We expect total cumulative Project Future costs to be approximately £800
million, including approximately £300 million in 2024. Although we will continue deploying capital expenditures on
Project Future throughout 2024, after the implementation of our new information technology systems, we expect to
be able to reduce these levels of capital expenditures.

**Contractual Commitments**

Our contractual commitments are principally related to our financial liabilities. The disclosed forward
contracts are the gross undiscounted cash flows. However, these amounts may be settled gross or net. The following
table sets forth our total contractual undiscounted obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2023 after giving
_pro forma effect to the Transactions as if it had occurred on such date (subject to the assumptions set forth in “Use of_
_Proceeds”). It does not include liabilities under supply chain or vendor financing facilities or the Ground Rent Facility._

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of December 31, 2023, the Group had no material off balance sheet arrangements or funding arrangements
that would be classified as a contingent liability under UK IFRS, except with respect to the ongoing Equal Value
Claims. With respect to the Equal Value claims, the Group has not recognised a provision on the basis that any loss

137


-----

or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings cannot be reasonably estimated and any potential liability is
only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to
an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. As a result of the change of ownership on February 16, 2021,
the Group has entered into an indemnification agreement which is guaranteed by the former ultimate parent of Asda
Stores Limited, Walmart with respect to these claims. Walmart has indemnified the Group for these claims up to a
contractually agreed amount. See note 29 (“Contingent liabilities”) of the 2023 Financial Statements for further
information on contingent liabilities. See “Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation” and “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters—From time to time we and/or our management are subject_
_to claims that can result in litigation, arbitration, tax or regulatory proceedings which could distract management_
_from our business activities and result in significant liability.”_

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Financial Risk Overview**

**_Overview_**

In the ordinary course of the Group’s business, it is exposed to a variety of market risks arising in relation to
its financial assets and liabilities, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and capital
risk. The Group has a risk management programme in place through which it seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of
these market risks. In addition, the Group hedges interest and exchange rate exposure on foreign currency debt
obligations. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

**_Credit risk_**

We believe there is no significant credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating
to financial assets is included in their carrying value as at the balance sheet date. See note 18 (“Trade, other receivables
_and derivative assets”) of the 2023 Financial Statements for further information on trade receivables, intercompany_
receivables and details of recoverability.

The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default in relation to trade receivables including
detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted. Surplus cash is placed in both short-term deposits
and money market funds with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Group’s treasury function
which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit in keeping with internal objectives.
This includes monitoring the credit rating of counterparties and investing in accordance with our internal policy.
Counterparty credit limits are reviewed on a monthly basis, and may be updated throughout the financial year. The
limits are set to minimise the concentration of risk and are set taking into account the type of financial asset and the
credit rating of the financial institution.

Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses model under IFRS 9
and the impact is not material. As such, the provision for expected credit losses is less than £0.1 million (as compared
to less than £0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2022).

**_Interest rate risk_**

The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate liabilities (based on SONIA and EURIBOR)
primarily composed of the Senior Facilities. During 2023, the Group was exposed to interest rate risk on a bridge
facility entered into to partially fund the Arthur Acquisition (the “Arthur Additional Bridge Facility”), this was
settled in full on October 23, 2023. The EURIBOR interest rate risk on Original Facility B is hedged through entering
into cross-currency interest rate swaps to fix the interest payments in pound sterling at rates between 3.70% and 3.76%
which expired on February 16, 2024. The SONIA interest rate risk on the Private Placement Facility entered into
during 2023 is hedged through entering into interest rate swaps to fix a proportion of the interest payments at a fixed
interest rate between 4.75% and 4.78% which expires on November 16, 2025. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Unsecured Notes is charged at fixed rates between 3.25% and 4.50%.

The Existing Senior Secured Notes are set at fixed rates of 3.25% and 4.50%. The Existing Senior Notes are
set at a fixed rate of 4.00%. The Senior Secured Notes will also be a fixed rate instrument.

138


-----

The Group, after the impact of hedge accounting, is exposed to possible changes in SONIA on its outstanding
floating rate loans. In the year ended December 31, 2023, it is anticipated that a 0.5% increase in the SONIA rate
would give rise to a decrease in profit before tax of £1.8 million (as compared to £1.2 million in the year ended
December 31, 2022 and £0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021).

The Group’s Original Facility A, and Original Revolving Facility have been impacted by the interest rate
benchmark reform in 2022. The Group transitioned these agreements to the new UK risk-free rate benchmark, SONIA,
which was applied to the Group’s interest period starting April 1, 2022 and which will also apply to New Facility A
and the New Revolving Facility. See note 21 (“Financial Instruments”) of the 2023 Financial Statements for further
information on interest rate risk.

_Interest rate swaps_

The Group has entered into the Private Placement Facility with interest rates calculated based on SONIA.
The variable interest rate exposes the Group to interest rate fluctuations that impact the profit or loss on a consolidated
basis.

At December 31, 2023, the Group holds interest rate swaps (“IRS”) with a total nominal value of £540.0
million, designated as cash flow hedges. The hedge ratio is on a 79% current notional basis. These IRS result in a
fixed GBP interest rate ranging from 11.50% to 11.53%.

The IRS were assessed to be highly effective and as at December 31, 2023, a net unrealised loss of £4.8
million was included in the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive
income during the year in respect of these swaps was £4.8 million. This consists of a £0.4 million gain reclassified to
the income statement during the year and a £6.0 million loss on the fair value of the swaps at year end and a taxation
credit of £1.6 million.

The value of the IRS is sensitive to movements in SONIA. A 0.5% change in SONIA results in a £10.9
million change in value of the IRS.

Following the Transactions, we plan to re-evaluate the implementation of foreign exchange and interest rate
hedging contracts in line with our historical approach.

**_Liquidity risk_**

The Group’s treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring
rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash flows. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of
funding and flexibility using operating cash flows and intercompany balances.

At December 31, 2023, the Group held cash of £1,027.7 million (as compared to £662.5 million at
December 31, 2022 and £505.5 million at December 31, 2021) to secure short-term flexibility. The amounts of
financing facilities available at the year-end are disclosed below:

(1) The increase in standby credit facilities bonds between the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023 is primarily a result of new facilities
the Group entered into with Rabobank, Markel International Insurance Company Limited and Liberty Mutual Insurance Europe, as
described further in “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

139


-----

In February 2024, the Group made a £19.5 million amortisation payment under the Original Facility A. For
more information about our financing facilities and liquidity risk, see note 21 (“Financial Instruments”) of the 2023
Financial Statements. For more information about our supply chain facilities, standby credit facilities bonds and other
guarantee facilities see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements.”

**_Foreign currency risk_**

_Forward currency hedging contracts_

The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling. Cash flows
can be affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US dollars and euro. Some purchases in US dollars are
managed using forward contracts.

The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at
December 31, 2023, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward
currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of future purchases. The terms of the forward
currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a period of
more than 18 months after December 31, 2023. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred
to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.

The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and at
December 31, 2023, a net unrealised loss of £12.2 million (as compared to a net unrealised gain of £36.2 million at
December 31, 2022 and a net unrealised gain of £43.7 million at December 31, 2021) was included in the hedge
reserve in respect of hedging contracts. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year ended
December 31, 2023 in respect of these hedging contracts was £15.8 million (as compared to a net loss of £7.5 million
at December 31, 2022 and a net gain of £43.7 million at December 31, 2021) and a gain of £32.6 million was
reclassified to retained earnings during the year ended December 31, 2023. This consists of a £36.3 million loss on
not-yet-matured contracts during the year (as compared to a gain of £14.4 million at December 31, 2022 and a net
gain of £11.6 million at December 31, 2021), £15.3 million of losses reclassified to the income statement during the
year (as compared to £23.4 million of gains at December 31, 2022 and £42.3 million of losses at December 31, 2021)
and a £5.2 million taxation credit (as compared to a £1.5 million taxation credit as at December 31, 2022 and a £10.2
million charge as at December 31, 2021).

Under the Group’s hedging policy, forward currency contracts can be used for both goods for resale and
goods not for resale. The only items for which forward currency contracts are in place as at December 31, 2023 are
forecast purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 100% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses
attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the income
statement at the point of sale. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash flows would be
the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the year ended December 31,
2023 (which was also the case during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022), therefore amounts recognised
in the income statement in relation to ineffective forward contract hedges were £nil (which was also the case during
the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022).

At December 31, 2023, the Group held £1,234.4 million of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts,
designated as cash flow hedges (as compared to £749.5 million as at December 31, 2022 and £699.9 million as at
December 31, 2021). These forward contracts are largely in relation to purchases of US dollars (notional $1,470.0
million) and euros (notional €71.4 million) with varying maturities up to June 2025. For the above currencies the rates
ranged from USD/GBP from 1.210 to 1.302 (as compared to 1.098 to 1.369 in the year ended December 31, 2022 and
1.315 to 1.420 in the year ended December 31, 2021) and euro/GBP 1.142 to 1.164 (as compared to 1.132 to 1.157 in
the year ended December 31, 2022 and 1.165 to 1.189 in the year ended December 31, 2021).

As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure using forward currency contracts, changes in
exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short-term profitability or cash flow. It is anticipated
that a 5% movement in the US Dollar/pounds sterling exchange rate, which represents management’s assessment of
a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of £47.2 million at
December 31, 2023 (as compared to a movement of £34.6 million in December 31, 2022 and a movement of
£33.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021).

See note 21 (“Financial Instruments”) of the 2023 Financial Statements for further information on foreign
currency risk.

_Cross-currency swap_

The Group has entered into Facility B (EUR) which is a floating rate euro denominated term loan facility.
The non-pounds sterling interest and principal repayment cash flows from the euro debt agreement expose the Group
to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that impact the consolidated basis.

Under the Group’s hedging policy, the Group hedges both the foreign exchange and interest rate risk
associated with a portion of the Group’s existing euro foreign-currency denominated debt using EUR-GBP cross
currency interest rate swap contracts to effectively eliminate variability in the Group’s functional currency equivalent
cash flows due to variability in the EUR-GBP exchange rate and the variable interest rate. The hedge ratio is 100%
on a current notional basis. The Group has excluded from the cross-currency interest rate swap both the time value
and currency basis elements of the cross-currency interest rate swap. Ineffectiveness could arise from movements in
counterparty credit spread, the non-zero fair value at the hedge designation date due to market changes that have
occurred since the instrument’s inception and changes to critical terms (such as reset dates, index mismatches or
payment dates). To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the
changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the change in fair value of the hedged items attributable
to the hedged risks. The amounts recognised in the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2023 relating
to ineffectiveness and excluded items was less than £0.3 million (as compared to less than £0.1 million in the year
ended December 31, 2022).

At December 31, 2023, the Group holds cross-currency interest rate swaps (“CCIRS”) with a total nominal value of
€844.5 million, designated as cash flow hedges. These swaps result in a fixed pounds sterling interest rate ranging
from 3.70% to 3.76% and EUR/GBP rate of 1.1412. On February 16, 2024, following the expiration of the CCIRSs
in place as at December 31, 2023, the Group entered into new CCIRSs with an expiration date of February 16, 2025
with the same counterparty banks. This eliminates variability in the Group’s functional currency equivalent cash flows
in relation to Original Facility B (EUR) for the Group for the 12-month period to February 16, 2025 and fixes the
interest rate on Original Facility B (EUR) at fixed GBP interest rates of between 8.03% and 8.06%. The Group is also
currently contemplating additional cross-currency swaps as well as interest rate swaps in respect of the unhedged
portion of its ongoing EUR exposure and floating rate exposure respectively under the Senior Facilities Agreement.
See “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure and the Senior Secured Notes—Currency exchange rates
_may have an impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.”_

The CCIRSs were assessed to be highly effective and as at December 31, 2023, a net unrealised gain of £3.1
million (as compared to £21.2 million at December 31, 2022 and £6.6 million at December 31, 2021) was included in
the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net loss recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve during 2023 in
respect of these swaps was £18.1 million (as compared to a gain £14.5 million at December 31, 2022 and a gain of
£7.3 million at December 31, 2021). This consists of a £2.5 million gain reclassified to the income statement during
2023 (as compared to £35.5 million gain at December 31, 2022 and £34.6 million loss at December 31, 2021), by a
£21.8 million loss (as compared to a £54.9 million gain at December 31, 2022 and £25.5 million loss at December 31,
2021) on the fair value of the swaps at period end and a taxation credit of £6.3 million (as compared to £4.8 million
at December 31, 2022 and £2.4 million at December 31, 2021).

The value of the CCIRSs is sensitive to movements in EURIBOR and EUR/GBP exchange rates. A 0.5%
change in EURIBOR would result in a £2.8 million change in value of the CCIRSs (as compared to £2.9 million at
December 31, 2022 and £6.5 million at December 31, 2021) and a 5% change in the EUR/GBP exchange rates would
result in a £47.2 million change in the value of the CCIRSs (as compared to £38.9 million at December 31, 2022 and
£38.1 million at December 31, 2021). The amounts charged to the income statement are not sensitive to a change in
interest rates but a 5% increase in the FX rate would increase the amount of ineffectiveness by £nil (as compared to
£nil at December 31, 2022 and £0.4 million at December 31, 2021).

Following the Transactions, we plan to re-evaluate the implementation of foreign exchange and interest rate
hedging contracts in line with our historical approach.

**Overview**

The retail sector in the United Kingdom, across all sales channels, was estimated by Euromonitor in the Retail
2024 edition to have had sales of approximately £460.4 billion in 2023, compared to £439.3 billion in 2022 (based on
a retail value retail sales price basis excluding sales tax (“Retail Value **RSP”) in current value terms), and to have**
grown at a CAGR of 3.0% between 2009 and 2023. According to Euromonitor, grocery retail – referring to the sum
of hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, warehouse clubs, small local
grocers and food/drink/tobacco specialists – is the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom.
It represented £200.6 billion of Retail Value RSP (comprising approximately 44% of total retail sales) in 2023,
compared to £190.7 billion of Retail Value RSP (comprising approximately 43% of total retail sales) in 2022. In the
past fourteen years, grocery retail in the United Kingdom only experienced negative year-on-year growth in 2015
(negative 0.2%) and 2016 (negative 4.6%), in spite of macroeconomic, uncertainties and periods of food deflation
measured by the consumer price index (“CPI”), according to the OECD.

We operate in the retail market, offering a wide range of both food and non-food products and services from
our supercentres, superstores, supermarkets, convenience and Asda Living stores, as well as through various online
platforms. The origins of our business are in the UK grocery retail market and, while our business has grown and
diversified into other markets including clothing retail and general merchandise retail, we remain focused on offering
high-quality, value-based grocery retail options to our customers.

Within the UK grocery retail market, we are the third-largest player in the UK grocery retail market (with a
13.7% market share) on the basis of Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar
Worldpanel.

**UK Grocery Retail Market Sizing**

The following chart sets forth the growth of the UK grocery retail market size on a Retail Value RSP basis
in each calendar year from 2009 to 2023 according to Euromonitor.

_(Source: Euromonitor: Retail 2024 Edition; Retail Value RSP excl. Sales Tax, GBP, Current terms. Note: The UK grocery retail market refers to_
_the sum of channels, including hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, warehouse clubs, small local_
_grocers as well as food/drink/tobacco specialists.)_

In 2023, grocery retail was the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom and was
valued at £200.5 billion on a Retail Value RSP basis, according to Euromonitor. Between 2009 and 2016, the UK
grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 2.2%. Between 2016 and 2023, the market grew at a CAGR of 3.1%. During
the COVID-19 pandemic between 2019 and 2020, it grew at a CAGR of 4.6%. Generally, we believe that sales in the
UK grocery retail market have demonstrated resilience and stability through economic cycles.

According to the ONS, inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, rose by 4.2% in the United
Kingdom in the twelve months ended January 2024 (down from 8.8% in the twelve months ended January 2023),
driven by, among others, higher food costs and freight costs. Additionally, the reduction in lower-paid jobs compared
to prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, led to a rise in average pay growth rates, which we believe will benefit the UK
grocery retail market environment, as higher wage rates can be supportive of spending trends, some of which may
trickle into grocery retail. According to the ONS, the United Kingdom’s real gross domestic product (“GDP”)
amounted to £2.0 trillion in 2023. The following chart sets forth the historical and projected year-on-year real GDP
growth in the United Kingdom for the period from 2007 to 2023. According to Fitch Solutions, although the United
Kingdom’s GDP declined by 10.4% in 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, GDP has rebounded in 2021 and returned
to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2022, with an average expected real GDP growth CAGR of approximately 0.4% from
2023 to 2025.

According to the ONS, as set forth in the following chart, the United Kingdom’s population reached 67.0
million in 2021 and is expected to grow at an approximate CAGR of 0.7% between 2021 and 2031.

_(Source: ONS.)_

In 2022, UK households spent, on average, £62.20 per week on food and non-alcoholic drinks, comprising
11.8% of average weekly household expenditure according to the ONS. Between 2007 and 2022, the percentage of
average household expenditure spent on food and non-alcoholic drinks ranged from 10.5% to 14.4%, as shown in the
following chart.

_(Source: ONS.)_

Furthermore, the split between at-home and out-of-home (“OOH”) food and drink consumption in the United
Kingdom has remained relatively stable in recent years, with the exception of 2020 – 2021 given the COVID-19
pandemic. This change has yet to be reversed, with OOH consumption remaining around 1,000 basis points lower
than pre-COVID-19 levels.

Moreover, as shown in the following chart, the UK grocery retail market has shown positive year-on-year
market growth for 12 out of the past 14 years. This growth is reflective of the relatively essential nature of grocery
purchases, which represent a necessary and regular household expenditure as compared to more discretionary
spending categories, such as clothing, footwear and electronics. According to Euromonitor, the UK grocery retail
market experienced solid growth of 5.2% between 2022 and 2023.

_(Source: Euromonitor: Retail 2024 Edition; Retail Value RSP excl. Sales Tax, GBP, Current terms. Note: The UK grocery retail market refers to_
_the sum of channels, including hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, warehouse clubs, small local_
_grocers as well as food/drink/tobacco specialists.)_

While the overall UK grocery retail market has in recent years remained stable in many respects, market
channels and customer habits have been changing. Customer preference has shifted away from larger, out-of-town
formats towards smaller, proximity formats, with customers prioritising convenience and shopping habits shifting
towards smaller basket sizes coupled with increased frequency of purchases. The industry has also seen the rapid
growth of discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and Lidl) that compete through differentiation on price coupled
with a more limited selection of own-brand products. According to Kantar Worldpanel, COVID-19 has accelerated
the shifts towards online purchasing since lockdown measures were first introduced in the United Kingdom in
March 2020, however, online channel growth started to slow down significantly and is now normalised since the
reopening post COVID-19 period. For more information, see “—UK Grocery Retail Key Trends.”

**_UK Grocery Retail Market Competitive Landscape_**

The following chart illustrates the UK grocery market breakdown by channel on a Retail Value RSP basis
and its development between 2009 and 2023, as well as the CAGRs between the years 2009 and 2016, 2016 and 2023,
and 2009 and 2023.

_(Source: Euromonitor: Retail 2024 Edition; Retail Value RSP excl. Sales Tax, GBP, Current terms. Note: The UK grocery retail market refers to_
_the sum of channels, including hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, warehouse clubs, small local_
_grocers as well as food/drink/tobacco specialists.)_

Grocery retail sales in the United Kingdom are made via multiple channels, including hypermarkets,
supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retailers and online. We currently operate in the hypermarket,
supermarket, convenience, forecourt and online channels.

Hypermarkets are larger-format retail stores, frequently located on out-of-town sites or as anchor stores in a
shopping centre, with a primary focus on selling food, beverages, tobacco and other groceries while offering a wide
variety of non-grocery products, such as general merchandise and clothing. Supermarkets are smaller-scale retail
stores that offer a wide variety of food, beverages and household products. Hypermarket formats are offered by the
traditional grocers, while supermarket stores are offered by stores such as the Co-op, Waitrose and M&S, in addition
to the traditional grocers. Based on Euromonitor data, the sum of hypermarket and supermarket channels constitute
the largest share by Retail Value RSP of the UK grocery retail market, representing 54.1% of grocery Retail Value
RSP in 2023. However, in the last five calendar years, growth for the sum of these two channels has slowed, with a
combined CAGR of 2.3% between 2018 and 2023, according to Euromonitor.

In contrast, over the past 15 years convenience stores such as Tesco Express, Sainsbury’s Local, Co-op On
the Go, Little Waitrose and M&S Simply Food, have gained popularity. In 2023, they represented 19.0% of Retail
Value RSP and are the second-largest channel in the grocery retail market, according to Euromonitor.

The forecourt channel represented 3.0% of the total grocery retail market on a Retail Value RSP basis in
2023 and grew at a CAGR of 2.3% between 2016 and 2023, according to Euromonitor. This was driven by recent
initiatives from forecourt operators to improve the food product quality and the foodservice offering. Forecourts also
usually have longer opening hours compared to hypermarkets and supermarkets and are often in close proximity to
end consumers. Based on Euromonitor, convenience retailers grew at a CAGR of 3.4% between 2015 and 2023.
Excluding convenience retailers, the UK grocery retail market grew at a 2.5% CAGR between 2015 and 2023.

The 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the resulting weakened customer sentiment thereafter helped
discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and Lidl) to gain a strong foothold in the UK grocery retail market. Between

147


-----

2007 and 2015, discounters gained considerable scale and market share due to new store openings and increased
footfall resulting primarily from product offerings targeted at increasingly price-conscious customers. According to
Euromonitor, the discounters channel represented 14.0% of the total grocery retail market on a Retail Value RSP basis
in 2023. For more information, see “—UK Grocery Retail _Key Trends.”_

Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK grocery retail market has seen an increasing shift away
from physical stores to online purchasing, with online grocery sales having grown significantly faster than those of
physical stores in recent years. According to Euromonitor, in 2023, the online channel (food & drink e-commerce)
comprised 13.8% of the UK grocery retail market. The online channel, which has also reported strong Retail Value
RSP growth historically, with a CAGR of 20.3% between 2018 and 2023, is driven by shoppers’ growing appetite for
convenience and digital connectivity, as well as by service enhancements in online operations. Following the outbreak
of the COVID-19 pandemic, this growth has been bolstered as customers increasingly turn to online groceries in order
to maintain social distance, a trend which may result in a sustained change in preferences going forward.

On the basis of Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, we are the third-largest player in the
UK grocery retail market (with a 13.7% market share), according to Kantar Worldpanel. Other key players are Tesco
(with a 27.3% market share), Sainsbury’s (with a 15.1% market share) and Aldi (with a 9.8% market share), in each
case on the basis of Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Together,
the traditional grocers of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons comprise 64.9% of the total market on the basis of
Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Other grocery retailers
include Aldi, Co-op, Lidl and Waitrose. Waitrose operates at the premium end of the market and commands a lower
share of the market at 4.5%, while the discounters Aldi and Lidl hold market shares of 9.8% and 7.6%, respectively,
in each case according to Kantar Worldpanel and on the basis of Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21,
2024.

The following chart sets forth the UK grocery market share of the main UK grocery retailers based on Till
Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel.

The following chart sets forth the UK online grocery market share of the top six UK grocery retailers on the
basis of Total Grocery Absolute Sales for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, compared to the 52-week periods
ended December for the years 2017 to 2022, the 52-week period ended January 22, 2023 and the 52-week period
ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel.

_(Source: Kantar Worldpanel, Take Home Panel, Grocery, Online, 52 w/e January 21[st] 2024. Note: “other” includes Amazon and other grocery_
_retailers.)_

The largest players in the UK online grocery retail market are Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s, Ocado (which
operates a 50/50 joint venture between Ocado Group and M&S) and Morrisons. According to Kantar Worldpanel, we
had a 19.3% market share in the UK online grocery market measured on the basis of Total Grocery Absolute Sales
for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, while Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Ocado and Morrisons had a market share of
36.4%, 17.8%, 14.4% and 6.1%, respectively.

**_UK Food Inflation_**

The UK grocery retail market experienced industry-wide price deflation from 2014 to 2016, with deflation
at negative 0.2% in 2014, negative 2.6% in 2015 and negative 2.4% in 2016, respectively, according to the OECD
(measured by the CPI). Low or no inflation or deflation, along with weakening customer demand and lower real wage
growth, contributed to discounters gaining a stronger foothold in the UK grocery retail market as they competed

through low prices and store openings to attract more price-conscious customers. These combined factors resulted in
downward pressure on our like-for-like sales growth from 2014 to 2016, as set forth in the following chart.

However, as food inflation in the United Kingdom has increased in more recent years, our LFL performance
has improved.

**UK Clothing and Footwear Retail Market**

The following chart below sets forth the development of the UK clothing and footwear retail market from
2009 to 2023 on a Retail Value RSP basis, including the breakdown between in-store and online sales, according to
Euromonitor.

_(Source: Euromonitor: Retail 2024 Edition; Retail Value RSP excl. Sales Tax, GBP, Current terms. Note: The UK Clothing and Footwear Retail_
_Market is referring to the sum of Apparel and Footwear Specialist Retailers and Apparel and Footwear E-Commerce.)_

In addition to the grocery retail market, we operate in the UK clothing and footwear retail market, which
includes the sale of a wide variety of clothing, footwear and accessories, through the George Clothing brand.
According to Euromonitor, the UK clothing and footwear retail market was valued at £45.9 billion on a Retail Value
RSP basis in 2023. During the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the UK clothing and footwear retail market declined
as a result of rising unemployment, pressure on discretionary spending and weakened customer confidence.
Furthermore, the market experienced a period of price inflation between 2010 and 2012. Between 2014 and 2019, the
UK clothing and footwear retail market grew at a CAGR of 2.7%, with much of the growth driven by online channels,
which had a CAGR of 11.3% between 2014 and 2019 in comparison to a CAGR of only 0.1% for in-store channels,

each on a Retail Value RSP basis, as stated by Euromonitor. These results reflect an overall trend toward increased
access to, and usage of, the internet coupled with a greater propensity to buy online and growing usage of social media
to influence and facilitate clothing and footwear retail sales.

The UK clothing and footwear retail market experienced a significant downturn in 2020 due to COVID-19
related lockdowns and reduced consumer demand for non-essential purchases which included clothing and footwear
with the overall market down -20.0% in 2020, according to Euromonitor. During the first of such lockdowns which
lasted from March 23, 2020 to July 4, 2020, all non-essential retail stores including all clothing and footwear stores
were ordered to close by the UK government. Subsequently, the value of retail sales of clothing and footwear at current
prices (seasonally adjusted) decreased by 12.0% in the first quarter of 2020 and 53.9% in the second quarter of 2020
respectively as compared to the same period a year earlier, according to ONS. In-store sales began to recover in the
third quarter of 2020 as lockdowns were eased. The third quarter and fourth quarter of 2020 saw a gradual recovery
with a 17.3% and 20.6% decrease respectively in the value of retail sales of clothing and footwear at current prices
(seasonally adjusted) compared to the same period a year earlier, according to ONS. As a result of COVID-19 related
lockdowns, the UK clothing and footwear retail market also experienced a significant shift from in-store purchasing
to online channels, which saw a 22.3% year-on-year growth according to Euromonitor.

In the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK clothing and footwear retail market recovered
beyond pre-pandemic levels by 2022, with a market value of £43.6 billion, according to Euromonitor. The return of
office working and in-person social events increased the need to purchase more formal clothing and footwear, while
the easing of COVID-19 restrictions has fuelled footfall recovery. This was further supported by pent-up demand and
local consumers missing the in-person shopping experience. Altogether, the in-store channel has benefitted from a
6.9% year-on-year growth and is valued at £28.8 billion in 2023, according to Euromonitor. While a smaller segment
of customers have either remained in a remote work environment or visited stores less often, as online shopping
consumer behaviour became the norm in a post-pandemic environment, sales for retail e-commerce fell in 2022.
Although habit persistence among some consumers ensured that overall sales levels for the latter remained
significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. For a further discussion of Asda’s position in the clothing market,
specifically relating to the George Clothing brand, see “Business—Our Brands” and “Business—Key Strengths—We

**UK Home Products Retail Market**

The following chart sets forth the development of the UK home products retail market from 2014 to 2023 on
a Retail Value RSP basis, including the breakdown between in-store and online sales.

_(Source: Euromonitor: Retail 2024 Edition; Retail Value RSP incl. Sales Tax, GBP, Constant 2023 prices. Note: The UK Home Products Retail_
_Market is referring to Homewares and Home Furnishing Stores and Home Improvement and Gardening Stores. Online refers to Home Products_
_Specialist E-Commerce.)_

We also operate in the UK home products retail market, which includes the sale of a wide variety of home
furniture and furnishings, homewares, floor coverings and soft furnishings through the George Home brand.
According to Euromonitor, the UK home products retail market was valued at £28.0 billion on a Retail Value RSP
basis in 2023. Between 2014 and 2023, the UK home products retail market experienced growth at a 3.1% CAGR on
a Retail Value RSP basis as stated by Euromonitor. Between 2014 and 2019, the UK home products retail market has
grown at a CAGR of 2.1%, with growth mainly driven by the online channel, which had a CAGR of 20.0% between
2014 and 2019, each on a Retail Value RSP basis, as stated by Euromonitor. While online sales continue to grow,
traditional in-store formats remain important in the UK home products and home furnishing retail market as customers
combine online research and purchasing with in-store visits as part of their buying process. Between 2014 and 2019,
the in-store segment Retail Value RSP grew by 0.5%, according to Euromonitor.

Similar to the UK clothing and footwear market, the UK home products market also experienced a significant
downturn in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-19 related lockdowns and reduced consumer demand for
non-essential purchases. However, the increased time spent by consumers at home due to the COVID-19 outbreak in
the United Kingdom has led to higher demand for home office equipment and home improvement activities. In 2020,
the overall UK market contracted by 6.2% year-on-year due to a 18.6% decline of the in-store segment, which was
partially offset by the online segment increasing by 76.7% year-on-year, according to Euromonitor. By 2021, the UK
home products retail market made a full recovery beyond pre-pandemic levels, increasing to a market value of £26.8
billion. As a result of COVID-19 travel restrictions, local consumers had additional discretionary income, and due to
prolonged time at home, there was a continued desire to upgrade their living environments.

In the post COVID-19 environment, the value of online purchases remained elevated compared to
pre-pandemic levels at £6.8 billion by 2023, signifying a habit persistence in consumer spending towards increased
utilisation of the online channel, according to Euromonitor. While the overall market has grown at a CAGR of 2.2%
between 2021 and 2023, this was driven by UK consumers having already made significant home products investments
in 2020 and 2021, with a reduced incentive to do so in subsequent years. Combined with the onset of the cost-of-living
crisis, cash-strapped consumers began to defer or cancel costlier home improvements. For a further discussion of
Asda’s position in the home products market, specifically relating to the George Home brand, see “Business—Our

**UK Foodservice Market**

The following chart sets forth the development of the UK foodservice market from 2014 to 2023 on a constant
price basis.

_(Source: Euromonitor: Consumer Foodservice 2024 Edition; Retail Value RSP excl. Sales Tax, GBP, Current terms. Note: UK_
_Foodservice Market.)_

We also operate in the UK foodservice market through our foodservice offerings, which include Greggs,
Subway, Burger King and Sbarro, as well as our own proprietary brand, Leon. According to Euromonitor, the UK
foodservice market was valued at £67.1 billion on a constant price basis in 2023. Between 2014 and 2023, the UK
foodservice market experienced a declining 1.6% CAGR, according to Euromonitor.

Similar to the UK clothing and footwear market & home products market, the UK foodservice market also
experienced a significant downturn in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-19 related lockdowns and reduced consumer
demand for out-of-home purchases.

In the post COVID-19 environment, the value of foodservice purchases remained depressed compared to prepandemic levels, underpinned by higher inflation and a more cash-strapped consumer for discretionary purchases.

**UK Grocery Retail Key Trends**

The UK grocery retail market has been undergoing a fundamental shift in recent years, driven by changing
customer lifestyles, technological changes, evolving competitive dynamics and socio-economic factors. These trends
have led to a shift towards discounters, convenience stores and online channels, amongst other changes.

We believe there are five key trends that may shape the future of the UK grocery retail market: the increased
focus on value-based propositions and the growth of the discounters, the growth of the online channel, the shift to
convenience, the redefinition of service expectations and the increased demands for social responsibility.

**_Increased focus on Value-Based Propositions and Growth of the Discounters_**

Since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and as bolstered by recent inflationary conditions and the current
cost of living pressures, customers have become increasingly price sensitive. Such customers, however, still desire
high-quality offerings. In response, discounters developed a range of value-based propositions focused on delivering
high quality at low prices, which appeal to this growing number of UK shoppers who seek a good ‘value.’ These

153


-----

propositions have helped discounters to achieve a strong presence in the UK grocery retail market. For example,
discounters Aldi and Lidl have increased their combined market share (on a Till Roll basis) from 4.4% in the calendar
year 2010 to 17.5% in the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel and as reflected in the
following chart.

_(Source: Kantar Worldpanel Take Home Panel, Grocery, 52 w/e January 21[st] 2024, Till Roll.)_

From 2013 to 2023, discounters gained considerable scale and market share as a result of new store openings
and continued price consciousness from customers, notably in the post COVID-19 environment, which has been
underpinned by higher inflation and a more cash-strapped consumer. According to Euromonitor and relevant public
reporting, discounters’ store count grew from 1,118 in 2013 to 1,980 in 2023, as set forth in the following chart.

As discounters have increased their store counts, they have won market share from other market players.
According to Kantar Worldpanel, for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, we had significant market share in the
same geographic areas where discounters already commanded a relatively high market share - the North of England
(15.8%), Scotland (13.5%) and Wales (14.1%) - on a Total Grocery Absolute Sales basis, where the discounters also
see strong performance. We believe that, as discounters seek to increase their market share through expansion in new
areas, they are likely to consider expanding into new regional markets - particularly in London, South of England and
East of England - where we have a lower market share, a trend that we believe is supported by the information about

market share by geography set forth in the following chart. We also believe the majority of Asda’s stores have
discounters in their catchment area.

On a Till Roll basis, we similarly had a significant market share in the same geographic areas where
discounters already commanded a relatively high market share - the North of England (19.4%), Scotland (16.6%) and
Wales (16.9%) (in each case, according to Kantar Worldpanel and for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024).

**_Growth of Online Channel_**

Asda, along with Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons and Waitrose, offer groceries and non-food items for
purchase and delivery online alongside “Click & Collect” services for purchases made through our websites. Pure
online players, such as Ocado and Amazon Fresh, also compete in the UK online grocery market.

The strong growth of online grocery sales in the United Kingdom is supported by multiple drivers, including:

    - Increasing population of tech-aware customers with a higher propensity to buy online;

    - Higher internet penetration (driven by increased usage of mobile and faster connections) combined with
an increasing propensity to use the internet to buy online;

    - Technological advances significantly improving the online proposition for customers (such as better
interfaces, mobile apps, convenient digital wallets and payment systems);

    - Improving product offerings as technology improves and competition increases (for example, greater
availability of products online compared to in-store); and

    - Improving delivery options as density of deliveries improves (resulting in cheaper, faster deliveries and
improved availability of more predictable, flexible and diverse delivery timeslots).

Growth in online grocery has been accelerated by the onset of COVID-19 as customers have increasingly
prioritised factors such as social distancing and convenience and government restrictions have encouraged customers
to find ways to remain at home.

**_Shift to Convenience_**

Another significant customer trend shaping the UK grocery retail market is customers’ increasing
prioritisation of convenience.

During 2020, the value of convenience store sales experienced a large growth spike of 9.2% as consumers
sought and bought their groceries closer to home, driving increased footfall into local convenience and forecourt retail
stores. Following the pandemic, convenience sales continued to remain elevated due to inflationary pressures related
to growing supply chain costs and rising energy bills, driving prices higher. In addition, convenience store sales in
2022 were boosted by the Jubilee weekend and its festivities, a warmer than usual summer with record temperatures
and the FIFA World Cup, boosting sales of products ranging from snacks to cold beverages. Finally, convenience
stores also benefitted from the return of pre-pandemic behaviour with footfall levels in city and town centres at higher
levels.

Growth is expected to normalise in the coming years as a result of the continued cost of living crisis, driving
local consumers to become more conscious of their spending, in particular with the rising cost of food products and
the growing value proposition of discount retailers. In spite of growth expectations settling down, however, there
remains notable tailwinds including the arrival of “frictionless” store formats, which enable the customer to shop for
groceries and walk out without passing by the point of sale, and growing partnership with third-party delivery services,
which will help drive visibility revenue and reach. Moreover, growth in the convenience retail segment will be
supported by an increasing preference amongst customers for more frequent but smaller shopping trips, with numerous
top-ups through the course of the week at smaller, more conveniently located stores. This trend can be partly explained
by a preference for reduced food waste in light of growing environmental concerns, smaller households, less
pre-planned lifestyles and a growing preference in general for convenience.

**_Redefined Service Expectations_**

Increasing digitalisation and evolving customer dynamics have shaped an increasingly fast-paced market.
Customers are now seeking a transparent and frictionless experience to improve and expedite their grocery retail
experience. This is reflected in the increased usage of self-checkout, “Scan & Go,” “Click & Collect” and online
services as customers opt to use these facilities to tailor and improve their shopping experiences. In line with the

156


-----

growing desire for convenience and efficient shopping experiences, there is increasing demand for combined and
differentiated service offerings in the grocery retail market, which allow customers to fulfil multiple needs in one
convenient location such as parcel collection and drop-off, pharmacy services and selections of household items, all
in addition to traditional grocery retail offerings. Grocery retailers, like ourselves, have responded with increased
service offerings such as ‘toyou,’ which takes advantage of customers’ growing online shopping habits to create a
service that allows customers to return or collect online purchases while on a regular trip to a brick-and-mortar grocery
retailer.

**_Increased Demand for Social Responsibility_**

Dedication to social responsibility is increasingly relevant to customers, particularly for Gen Z and Millennial
customers, and a commitment to social responsibility has become a necessary factor if retailers want to meet
customers’ expectations. There is a growing share of customers who have concerns about animal welfare,
environmental sustainability and ethical sourcing, and who view their purchasing decision as a lifestyle statement. In
line with these concerns, customers are increasingly demanding traceability and information about production
methods, driving the popularity of fair trade and organic products that can meet these needs. In response, retailers are
adapting their business models in order to meet customers’ demand.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom and the second-largest grocery retailer in the
North of England, Scotland and Wales (in each case in terms of Till Roll data on a 52-week basis as of January 21,
2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We operate a significant store estate of over 1,200 large stores and
convenience sites that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom. We also have the second largest
online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of
January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We are also now a major player in the UK convenience market,
having added 472 convenience sites (including petrol filling stations) to our portfolio, as well as 124 stand-alone
foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites), following the Arthur Acquisition and EG UK Acquisition. These
acquisitions have given us significant foothold in the fast-growing convenience market which, alongside our existing
fuel portfolio, makes us the second-largest independent fuel owner-operator in the United Kingdom. The graph below
compares our total grocery market share with that of other major UK grocery retailers based on Till Roll data for the
52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel.

_(Source: Kantar Worldpanel, Take Home Panel, Grocery, 52 w/e January 21[st] 2024, Till Roll.)_

We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by favourable
macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household expenditure on food and
beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through economic fluctuations. Groceries
are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe generally allows the grocery retail market to
weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market
demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and
during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed only by a slight contraction as the pandemic eased. Since, the UK grocery
retail market has experienced consistent growth, achieving a record-high size of £144.0 billion in sales for the 52week period ended December 24, 2023, according to Kantar Worldpanel, despite facing high inflation and global
geopolitical tensions in 2022 and 2023. See also “Industry.”

One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is in turn
centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to offering high quality
products with low prices to our customers and our wholly-owned supplier, International Procurement and Logistics
Ltd (“IPL”), which enables us to take a vertically-integrated approach to procurement and which we believe gives us
a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and
well-established George Clothing and George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers, our

growing presence in the convenience and foodservice market, our popular customer loyalty programme Asda
Rewards, and our team of flexible and engaged colleagues.

We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended December 31,
2023, our revenue was £25.6 billion (including fuel), with 16.5% of sales made online, our net cash flow from
operating activities was £1,245.8 million, our profit for the year was £194.5 million, and our Pro Forma Adjusted
EBITDA was £1,264 million.

Excluding the results of the EG UK Business, which was acquired on October 31, 2023, and the results of
the Arthur Business, which was consolidated from May 31, 2023, the chart below presents the breakdown of our 2023
revenue by product category (food, general merchandise, clothing and petrol), and channel (stores and online
(including George.com)).

_(Source: Asda information. Year ended December 31, 2023. Note: excluding approximately £588 million from the Arthur Acquisition, £411_
_million from the EG UK Acquisition and £199 million of other revenue from Asda Mobile sales, financial services sales, shipping and wrapping_
_revenue, pharmacy revenue and, until the EG UK Acquisition, Asda On The Move.)_

Our differentiated operating model has resulted in strong financial performance: our successful financial
profile is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital
Expenditure KPI) and cash conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. For
more information on our differentiated operating model, see “—Key Strengths—We benefit from a differentiated
_operating model.”_ Between 2021 and 2023, our average profit margin (defined as profit for the year divided by
revenue) was 4.3%, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.2% (including fuel), our cumulative cash flows from
operating activities totalled £3,340.6 million, cumulative free cash flow was approximately £2,097 million and our
average cash conversion was 68%. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial
_Data—Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_

We believe that our business, operating model and financial performance also benefit from our significant
freehold real estate asset portfolio, which also can provide a potential source of liquidity. See “Valuation Report.” In
2023, through the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and 2023 Ground Rent Transaction, we have been able to,
and in the future may continue to, selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to take advantage of
favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities. See “—Lease Agreements.”

We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we maintain
a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom. We have made more than
£300 million annualized price investment since 2022 across over 1,200 lines. Within the UK value market, we have
strong market shares across core grocery products (13.1%), beers, wines and spirits (12.8%), impulse grocery (12.1%),
household and pet (12.1%), frozen (11.4%) and total grocery (11.4%) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute
Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). Our offer is strong across the full
food basket: our category market shares range from 9.6% to 13.1% (except health and beauty)(in each case in terms
of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We
believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal
Asda data, our prices are approximately 2.5% to 6.1% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on the
average of the first eight weeks in 2024, based on total goods price gap percentage). We believe our prices continue
to compete with those of discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. In January 2024, we launched a new price matching
programme where we have price matched Aldi and Lidl on approximately 300 comparable grocery products, which
reduced prices by an average of 17% to match whichever discounter had the lowest price on these products.

Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is supplemented
by a large clothing and general merchandise business. We offer our entire range of food and non-food products to
customers as an accessible “one-stop shop” experience that is supported and enhanced by our strong online offer and
expansion into the convenience market under the Asda Express banner. We believe our omni-channel offer, through
which we reach customers at our brick-and-mortar stores and through our significant online offering and on our app,
appeals to our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic increased use of and engagement with our online platforms. In
the first half of 2021, there were approximately 8.6 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with order growth
from approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended
February 28, 2020) to an average of more than 773,000 weekly orders in 2021 (based on the average weekly orders
for the first 26 weeks of 2021) and a peak of more than 850,000 orders during the third lockdown (based on the seven
days to January 15, 2021). Online engagement has fallen from the peaks experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic,
but we have continued to grow our online business, with an average of approximately 774,000 weekly orders in 2022
and 2023 (based on the average weekly orders in 2022 and 2023). We also offer at-home delivery and customers are
able to collect their purchases at one of approximately 460 Asda Click & Collect sites. Our business model integrates
our store-based and online offer by leveraging our stores to fulfil online orders.

Our online grocery business is profitable within one of the world’s most developed online grocery markets.
According to Kantar Worldpanel, as of January 21, 2024, we operate the second-largest online grocery platform in
the United Kingdom, holding 19.3% of market share (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales),
growing our market share in a market that is 5.5% larger on a one-year basis (comparing Total Grocery Absolute
Online Sales from the 52 weeks ended January 22, 2023 to the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024). Our online business
is already of significant scale; the chart below shows the growth of our online sales, including a breakdown of online
grocery versus George.com sales, for the periods presented.

-----

According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the third-largest online clothing, footwear and accessories retailer
in the United Kingdom by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024 and we held 8.5% of the total
UK online clothing, footwear and accessories market by volume for the 24 weeks ended January 7, 2024. Combined
sales for our online grocery business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion
(of which £1.5 billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £3.6 billion in
2023 (of which £3.2 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR
of 16.2% between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, our ‘toyou’ service allows customers to conveniently collect and
return orders from George.com and other partner retailers at our stores. We have partnered with 112 brands and
processed more than 4.4 million parcels in the year ended December 31, 2023.

We also have a strong presence in the convenience market with significant opportunity for additional
expansion in this fast-growing sector. In October 2022, we took our first notable step into the convenience market
after acquiring 132 sites including 129 convenience sites attached to forecourts from the Co-op (the “Co-op sites,”
and such business, the “Arthur Business”) and three development sites as part of the Arthur Acquisition. We agreed
to divest 13 of the Co-op sites following the recommendation of the CMA after an Initial Enforcement Order stemming
from its review of the acquisition. The disposals of these sites completed across December 2023 to January 2024 for
proceeds of £25.2 million. Each Co-op site included a grocery retail store between 1,500 and 3,000 square feet of
space and an attached petrol filling station driving footfall. In October 2023, we acquired the majority of EG Group’s
business in the United Kingdom for total cash consideration of £2.1 billion (including transaction fees). The deal
represented a major step in our convenience proposition, adding 356 well-invested PFSs to our convenience portfolio,
161 of which are stand-alone and 195 of which are co-located with foodservice concessions, as well as 124 stand-alone
foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). In foodservice, we acquired franchises for some of the United
Kingdom’s best loved outlets, including Greggs, Subway, Burger King and Sbarro, as well as our own proprietary
brand, Leon. Certain of our acquired sites also continue to benefit from an additional KFC and Starbucks non-Group
branded offerings operated by third parties. Through this acquisition, we accessed another high-growth sector,
foodservice, tapping into a new market which is highly complementary to Asda’s current offering. Each of the acquired
sites are community-focused and strategically located at the heart of residential areas with a diversified footprint across
the United Kingdom, and represent broader retail destinations with ancillary services such as parcel delivery, car wash
and last mile food delivery, with opportunity to expand further. The acquired sites also present a significant
opportunity for further synergies across Asda’s business through higher volumes, buying synergies and cost savings
through operational leverage.

In September 2023, we began the conversion of the Co-op sites from Co-op branding to our Asda Express
banner, implementing Asda pricing across fuel and grocery upon conversion. We completed the conversion of the
remaining convenience sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in
March 2024. Total capex investment to convert the stores to Asda Express was approximately £17 million. We believe
we will be able to bring Asda’s great value to even more customers across the United Kingdom by reaching new
communities and shoppers with this smaller store format. In the converted Co-op sites, our Asda Express prices were
an average of 6.1% cheaper than their corresponding prices under Co-op ownership. We also have further organic
Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in 2023 and a strong pipeline of approximately 40 sites that
have been identified for potential opening in 2024. Going forward, our focus will be on the continued integration of
the Co-op sites and EG UK Business into the Asda Group and delivering synergies.

Currently, with our team of approximately 150,000 flexible and engaged colleagues, with around 98,000 fulltime employees, serving approximately 16.8 million customer trips each week (based on the average of weeks 37 to
40 of 2023), we are committed to and deeply invested in the UK food supply chain.

Our business model is supported by diversification. First, we are a mass market retailer that serves the entire
UK population, in terms of both customer demographics and geography, with our customer base skewing slightly
towards value-seeking families, younger shoppers and lower-income customers who are attracted by our strategy to
offer high quality products at low prices and with strong market shares in the North of England, Scotland and Wales.
For more information about our customer mix, see “—Our Customers,” and for more information about the geographic
distribution of our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.” Second, we believe we are well-positioned geographically, with
a strong regional footprint across the United Kingdom. Our store footprint is strongest in the North of England,
Scotland and Wales. Our large and diverse store estate offers customers a variety of differentiated shopping formats.
We operate 30 supercentres, 396 superstores, 153 supermarkets, 30 Asda Living stores, 499 convenience sites

(including our petrol filling stations) and 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). For more
information on our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.”

We continue to benefit from certain support provided by Walmart through the Transitional Agreements,
primarily in relation to the continued use of its IT platform. We have set up a dedicated team to facilitate the transition
of our IT environment away from the Walmart ecosystem and onto a stand-alone IT solution, which we refer to as
Project Future. We believe Project Future presents significant opportunities in terms of our efficiency, data
capabilities, customer experience and competitive edge and are targeting complete separation from Walmart by the
end of 2024. See “—Our Technology and Information Systems,” “Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions—_
_Delays in our ability to separate from Walmart could result in significant cost and any issues with the separation_
_process, particularly related to our transition to a new IT system, could significantly disrupt business operations and_
_impact our ability to meet our strategic objectives.”_

**History**

Headquartered in Leeds, we are an omni-channel retailer across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. We have built our business on listening to our diverse range of customers, offering what they need at the best
value and bringing innovation to the UK market.

We were founded in 1965 through the merger of the Asquith family grocery business with the Associated
Dairies company in Yorkshire. Our name is derived from this historic merger, combining “Asquith” and “Dairies” to
form “Asda.”

Founded in the North of England, we have a rich history, heritage and culture. The Asquith family has deep
ties to the grocery business, W.R. Asquith having run a butcher’s shop in Knottingley, West Yorkshire, which
eventually expanded to seven shops. W.R. Asquith’s sons, Peter and Fred, went on to create the United Kingdom’s
first self-service supermarket in Castleford, introducing food discounting to the UK grocery market, and eventually
co-founded Asda. In parallel to the growth of the Asquith family business, a group of West Riding dairy farmers joined
forces, eventually becoming Associated Dairies & Farm Stores Limited led by Arthur Stockdale. Arthur’s son, Sir
Noel Stockdale, went on to co-found Asda with Peter and Fred Asquith.

In 1965, we acquired GEM, a major U.S. discount retailer operating in the United Kingdom. With the
addition of general merchandise to the former GEM stores, we introduced the superstore to the UK market, a landmark
event in the development of UK retailing. To complement this offer, Peter Asquith also introduced the first discounted
petrol filling station.

By 1970, we operated over 30 stores and were poised to expand beyond our original home in the North of
England. Throughout the 1970s, we grew our presence in the South of England, opening stores in Newport, Plymouth
and Gosport. In 1977, we launched our “Asda Price” TV adverts, featuring the “pocket tap” which came to be the
official sign language for Asda. By the end of the 1970s, we were operating over 80 stores and opened our 100[th] store
in 1981.

Throughout the 1980s, we focused on expanding our distribution capabilities, opening seven new distribution
centres strategically located throughout the United Kingdom by 1985. In 1987, our flagship Watford store opened,
another landmark in UK retailing, and featured the longest-ever checkout bank at the time, with 45 checkouts. In 1988,
we opened our headquarters in Leeds, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher overseeing the opening ceremonies. In
1989, George Davies was asked to produce a line of clothing for us that was high-quality, high-value and had its own
identity: the pioneering George brand was born.

In the 1990s, we developed the Asda Way of Working, an innovative framework for a new organisational
structure that focuses on our stores and promotes colleague involvement, which set the stage for the Asda culture of
today. In 1996, we opened our first Asda Pharmacy location in Harrogate, North Yorkshire and launched our “Tickled
Pink” campaign to raise money for the fight against breast cancer, a partnership that continues to this day. In 1998,
we began our online retail operations with a dedicated depot in Croydon.

162


-----

In 1999, we joined the Walmart family, becoming part of the world’s largest retailer. Throughout the early
2000s, we continued to grow and innovate, expanding our online and Click & Collect offers, opening our first Asda
Living store and our first Eco Store, winning awards for the value we offer customers as well as for the positive
environment we create for colleagues, launching our Free From and Extra Special offers, launching stand-alone PFSs
as well as Asda Opticians. In 2015, we celebrated our 50[th] birthday and George’s 25[th] birthday. Asda has continued to
innovate, including the United Kingdom’s first parcel tower, which allows customers to collect online orders in less
than 60 seconds, and voice-activated shopping through Google Home.

In October 2020, the Issa Brothers and TDR Capital reached an agreement with Walmart to acquire a majority
stake in Asda, with Walmart retaining an equity interest in the business. Following regulatory approval, the deal closed
in February 2021 and our new owners were able to take operational control in June 2021.

In October 2022, we took our first significant step into the convenience market and acquired 116 convenience
sites from the Co-operative Group (“Co-op”) as part of the Arthur Acquisition, expanding our community-focused
reach of retail destinations and petrol filling station driving footfall in strategic locations at the heart of residential
areas.

On October 31, 2023, we greatly expanded our footprint in the convenience market and completed the
purchase of the majority of the EG UK business for total cash consideration of £2.1 billion (including transaction
fees), adding a total of 480 sites to our portfolio (consisting of 356 petrol filling stations, two of which have since
closed, and 124 foodservice sites) through the EG UK Acquisition. In March 2024, we completed the conversion of
the acquired Co-op sites and EG UK Business sites to Asda Express. We look forward to exciting prospects in this
new market, including the expansion of the Asda Express convenience format to new locations.

Our values are rooted in service to our customers, respect for the individual, striving for excellence and acting
with integrity. We pursue our values with the support of our colleagues, culture and technology.

**Key Strengths**

We believe that we benefit from the following strengths, including being a business of significant scale with
a history of resilient performance, a differentiated operating model, a successful financial profile and a significant
asset backing, as further described below.

**_We are a business of significant scale with a history of resilient performance_**

_We operate in a large, historically stable, resilient and growing industry with favourable macroeconomic tailwinds_

We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market, which has demonstrated resilient
performance underpinned by favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence
and household spend on food and beverages. For example, UK GDP growth has shown stable development over the
years. Although the United Kingdom’s GDP declined by 10.4% in 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, GDP rebounded
in 2021, returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2022 and amounted to approximately £2.0 trillion in 2023, according to
Fitch Solutions, with an average expected GDP growth of approximately 0.4% from 2023 to 2025.

The UK grocery retail market is also characterised by favourable demographic characteristics, including a
growing population. According to ONS, the UK population is projected to grow from 67 million in 2021 to over 73
million by 2036, which is expected to result in an overall increase in the consumer base for groceries.

In addition to its historical stability, the UK grocery retail market is also resilient. In 2023, grocery retail was
the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom – valued at £200.5 billion on a Retail Value RSP
(as defined herein) basis, according to Euromonitor. Groceries are a necessary and stable consumer expenditure, which
generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets that
involve more discretionary spending. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest
periods of growth in recent history during and following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the
COVID-19 pandemic: between 2009 and 2016, the UK grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 2.2% and between
2016 and 2023, the UK grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 3.1%, with a growth CAGR of 4.6% during the
COVID-19 pandemic from 2019 and 2020. Additionally, during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, according to

163


-----

ONS, the percentage of average weekly household spend on food and non-alcoholic drinks remained fairly consistent
at approximately 11.0%, demonstrating the market’s resilience during periods of macroeconomic difficulty, and this
percentage spiked to 14.4% in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting an increase in at-home consumption
during the pandemic. This percentage has remained relatively flat in the intervening years, ranging between 10.5%
and 11.8% from 2007 to 2022. In recent years, as the COVID-19 global pandemic was waning, Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine sparked an energy crisis which further accelerated growing inflation and cost of living pressures. However,
according to Kantar Worldpanel, the UK grocery market, comprised of grocers (and excluding non-grocers), has
grown by 8.7% over the past three years (on a Till Roll basis for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, compared to
the 52 weeks ended January 24, 2021).

_We are the United Kingdom’s third-largest grocer, holding sizeable market share_

According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom, with 13.7%
of market share and the second-largest grocery retailer in the North of England, Scotland and Wales (based on Till
Roll data over 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024). For the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenue was £21.9
billion (excluding fuel). We have a network of over 1,200 large stores and convenience sites throughout the United
Kingdom, with a particular focus on superstores, supermarkets, online formats and convenience. We are also the
second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom by value (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on
a 52-week basis as of January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel), and have grown our market share over
many years, maintaining this share in a much-enlarged market as customers turned to online shopping throughout the
COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we believe that we are well-positioned as a large and established business with a
clear set of peers.

We also believe that our multi-format, omni-channel offer positions us well to compete effectively and to
continue growing our market share. Following the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition, which gave us a
significant foothold in the convenience and foodservice markets, our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended
December 31, 2023 were £25,619.9 million and £1,078 million, respectively, compared to £24,477.8 million and £867
million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that we also hold a leading position in the
UK foodservice market.

We cater to a broad target demographic, which we believe provides us a long-term competitive advantage.
In contrast to discounters, we provide a broad range of branded and own-brand offers, while also having a more
developed and established online platform.

_We believe we have faced the greatest impacts of discounters on our market_

The adverse impact of discounters (primarily Aldi and Lidl) on the traditional grocers in recent years has
been significant but, while we believe that discounters will continue to put pressure on the market, we believe that we
and other traditional grocers have already faced the greatest impacts of this competition in the markets in which we
operate and, if anything, that the discounters pose a greater challenge to other traditional grocers, who we believe are
more geographically exposed to the areas where discounters are likely to focus in the near-term.

As compared to our traditional grocer peers, our geographical concentration is in the North of England,
Scotland and Wales, as evidenced by our number two market shares in those regions. The discounters have already
penetrated these areas and we expect the discounters to continue to shift the focus of their expansion to the South of
England, the East of England and London, where we operate fewer sites as compared to the Midlands, the North of
England, Scotland and Wales. Furthermore, the catchment areas of 76.7% of our stores already contain both major
discounters, Aldi and Lidl, which is a higher percentage than any of our traditional grocer competitors (the boundary
used is a 10-minute drive-time radius around each point, which is consistent regardless of location type or size of
store, but excludes convenience stores, and stores are only included in the count where there is both Aldi and Lidl
stores present within the drive-time boundary). Therefore, we believe that our current performance already factors in
the adverse impact of discounters to a large extent.

Moreover, according to Kantar Worldpanel, we have stemmed the losses to the discounters in recent months,
and we have reduced switching losses to the discounters to a two-year record low for the 4 weeks ended February 18,
2024. Together, Lidl and Aldi account for 17.5% of the market, with Aldi’s share at 9.8% and Lidl at 7.6% in each
case on the basis of Till Roll data and according to Kantar Worldpanel for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024.

However, the growth experienced by the discounters has begun to fall sharply, with Aldi posting growth behind the
market for the four weeks ended January 21, 2024, and Lidl’s growth decreasing over 50% for the same period
compared to the four weeks ended January 22, 2023.

We also believe we can reduce losses to the discounters through our value proposition, including our opening
price point range, Just Essentials. In January 2024, we also launched a new price matching programme where we have
price matched Aldi and Lidl on 287 comparable grocery products, which reduced prices by an average of 17% to
match whichever discounter had the lowest price on these products.

_We have demonstrated resilience through downturns_

Just as our market has proven resilient in times of economic difficulty and uncertainty, our business has also
proven resilient during recent economic and market downturns, including during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis,
the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as through the rise of discounters in the UK grocery retail market in more recent
years, particularly during 2014 to 2016. During the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, we continued to perform well,
achieving an average like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) growth rate of 6.1% for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2008 and 2009. Our EBITDA margins have also remained stable, ranging from 4.7% to 4.9% between 2007 and 2023.

Despite the significant social and economic shifts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, our business
experienced strong overall performance, particularly in our online and supermarket formats. Overall, our food business
performed consistently throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an initial increase in sales due to panic buying
and customers stocking-up on key staples at the outset of each of the first three lockdown periods. Following an initial
decline at the beginning of the first lockdown, our general merchandise business also generally performed well
throughout these lockdown periods, due to increasing purchases of homeware products. While our clothing business
was initially negatively impacted during the early stage of the first UK lockdown period, we experienced improved
performance in this business in line with an overall improvement of the general economy and a rebound in consumer
confidence.

Recently, geopolitical tensions and ongoing inflation above historical norms and the Bank of England’s target
have led to uncertainty in the market and for our consumers. However, we have remained highly resilient in the face
of these challenges and have kept focused on supporting customers and colleagues with cost-of-living pressures, whilst
continuing to deliver strong financial results. During times of economic stress, we believe our value proposition is
particularly appealing to customers and can drive sales: we benefited from increased sales generating revenue
(excluding fuel) of £21.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to £20.4 billion for the year ended
December 31, 2021. As the current high inflationary environment persists, we are focused on initiatives to support our
customers in the cost-of-living crisis and protect market share by investing in price and quality, which we believe can
drive growth. For example, in 2022, we also launched our new grocery opening price point range, Just Essentials by
Asda that expands the range of its predecessor, Asda Smart Price, from approximately 160 to 272 products with new
branding and reformulations for taste and quality. In the same year, we also rolled out a “Dropped and Locked” price
campaign, where we locked in the prices of over 100 grocery items to give customers certainty around their shopping
costs during the year, as well as our loyalty rewards programme, Asda Rewards, as an indirect cost-saving scheme for
customers to earn cash back on their shopping.

**_We benefit from a differentiated operating model, including a diversified proposition with unique multi-format and_**
**_multi-channel offering_**

_We have well-developed own-brands_

We believe that our own-brand offers have been a key strength of our business and continue to offer growth
opportunities. We have an extensive own-brand product range in our food business, with approximately 7,800
own-brand SKUs. Our approach to range development and innovation enables us to identify and meet changing
customer needs and has resulted in the creation of many award-winning products; we launched approximately 950
lines in 2021, 1,547 new lines in 2022 and 1,597 new lines in 2023, and approximately 3,858 lines were reformulated
in 2023. As a result of the EG UK Acquisition, we also acquired Leon, our own proprietary foodservice brand. In
addition to our diverse and extensive product offer with our own-brand range, we have also been able to drive growth
through service and price positioning. We leverage our IPL sourcing model to deliver value, especially in our produce,
cooked meats and wine segments. In particular, the introduction and development of the opening price point range,

165


-----

Just Essentials, has been key to helping customers with the cost-of-living pressures in 2023 after the “Dropped and
Locked” price campaigns in 2022, where we locked in the prices of over 100 grocery items to give customers certainty
around their shopping costs during that year. We also offer own-brands through George, see “—The George Clothing
_and George Home offers are generally profitable and well-established.”_

_We are driven by our commitment to delivering low prices to our customers_

We believe our commitment to delivering low prices to our customers is a competitive advantage as we aim
to lead on price while staying competitive on assortment and quality. We believe that we are the least expensive
full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal Asda data, our prices are approximately
2.5% to 6.1% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on average for the first eight weeks in 2024,
based on total goods price gap percentage). Following the implementation of our Aldi and Lidl price matching
programme, which runs alongside our established customer value propositions, including Just Essentials, Asda Smart
Price, our price locking campaigns, Fab 5 and Asda Rewards, we believe our prices can compete with those of
discounters. Our low prices are supported by rigorous cost control and a commitment to affordability, which enables
us to control expenses so that we can pass cost savings on to our customers.

_Loyal customer base through our reward loyalty programme, Asda Rewards_

In 2022, we launched our new loyalty programme, Asda Rewards. The app-based scheme enables customers
to earn cash back on their shopping, building Asda Pounds in their cash pots to spend in store. The programme also
provides the opportunity to leverage data insights which enables us to better target investment in the customer
proposition. Asda Rewards total users and penetration among customers has grown quickly, with over 7.5 million new
users joining over the last 12 months and a total of 1.6 million members who have registered for Blue Light. The
number of total active customers reached 4.9 million as of December 31, 2023 over the prior 30-day period, and the
programme has earned around £300 million revenue in 2023. The following graph shows the increasing sales
penetration, or the number of sales linked to customers using Asda Rewards since its inception, which reached 50.6%
in the week of Christmas in 2023:

By the end of 2023, we saw approximately 47% of sales linked to Asda Rewards. We have found that after
joining Asda Rewards, members spend more than non-members within every segment and are more likely to become
repeat customers. In particular, we believe that members spend more than 10% after joining the programme (measured

166


-----

through tokenised payment cards) and for our high value customers, we believe that this equates to an incremental
addition of approximately £11 per week. By driving sales volume, the loyalty scheme has been incrementally
profitable since shortly after its launch, and the Retail Media segment has achieved £103.1 million profit. The
following graph shows the average sales by quarter of Asda Rewards members versus non-members.

_We operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, which is profitable_

The United Kingdom has one of the most developed online grocery retail markets in the world, with one of
the highest rates of the population using the internet. There has been a significant shift in the grocery retail market
away from brick-and-mortar stores to online purchasing as demographic trends, greater mobile and device usage,
improved service proposition and technological advances in applications and customer interfaces have driven
increasing penetration rates in the online grocery retail market. We believe we are poised to take advantage of these
favourable consumer trends, as we have already established ourselves in the rapidly growing UK online grocery retail
market and our store and warehouse footprint is strategically positioned across attractive geographic areas to service
the growing demand for groceries online.

According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the second-largest online grocery retail platform in the United
Kingdom, holding 19.3% of market share (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) for the 52-week period ended
January 21, 2024. Having responded quickly to the increase in demand for online shopping during the COVID-19
pandemic, we have continued to grow our online business, with an average of approximately 774,000 weekly orders
in 2022 and 2023 (based on the average weekly orders in 2022 and 2023). As a result of our strong performance in
the online market, combined sales for our online grocery business and George.com rapidly increased from previous
years to a total of £3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 (of which £3.2 billion were online grocery sales
and £0.4 billion were George.com sales) as compared to £3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 (of which
£2.9 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales). According to Kantar Worldpanel, we
hold an 8.5% share of the UK online clothing, footwear and accessories market (in terms of volume of units sold on a
24-week basis as of January 7, 2024).

We believe there is greater scope for our online profitability to improve further. We expect that the demand
for online groceries will continue to be strong as customers increasingly adopt online shopping as a more permanent
and preferred way to purchase groceries.

_The George Clothing and George Home offers are generally profitable and well-established_

We launched our clothing offer, George, in 1990 and it is the third-largest clothing footwear and accessories
retailer in the United Kingdom by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024 and is the leading UK
childrenswear retailer with 18.7% market share by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024, in
each case according to Kantar Worldpanel. Despite challenges to this product category overall, our online clothing
sales have increased from £379.3 million for the year to December 31, 2021 to £423.4 million for the year ended
December 31, 2023, with 82% of all sales made via mobile devices in 2023. We believe this demonstrates our strength
in the online segment, which is a key part of our operating model. Additionally, we have expanded the George branded
offer to include general merchandise, including through collaborations with strategic partners. We have extended

167


-----

product ranges with partners who specialise in certain categories, have a strong affinity fit with our existing customers
and bring complementary expertise and reputation, such as in homeware with Stacey Solomon and Claire’s in
jewellery and accessories. The George Home brand generated approximately £747.7 million in sales and contributed
approximately 50.0% of our total general merchandising sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. Sales by the
George Home brand grew at a CAGR of approximately 3% between the years ended December 31, 2021 and
December 31, 2023. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product categories generally have higher
margins than our food product categories.

**_We benefit from a well invested and vertically integrated model and are supported by a significant asset base_**

_We benefit from vertically integrated procurement through IPL_

We believe that we have a competitive advantage in food sourcing via our captive sourcing arm, IPL, which
enables us to take a vertically integrated approach to procurement. We believe that IPL provides us with valuable
sourcing differentiation as compared to our competitors. IPL is one of the largest importers of produce in the United
Kingdom and, while IPL is a group company and exclusively serves Asda, it is also our largest supplier. The aim of
our vertically integrated procurement model is to consolidate import activity for key products and reduce our overall
costs. In 2023, we purchased £1,724 million of our products through IPL. The foundation of IPL’s cost-price advantage
is that it eliminates the “middleman” who typically serves as the intermediary in the supply chain, thereby giving us
greater control of costs, quality and supply of a diverse range of products. We have an extensive IPL footprint across
the United Kingdom, with nine processing facilities across the country and more than 3,793 colleagues as of the year
ended December 31, 2023. Our IPL product mix is diversified according to our needs, with a mix of 56% fruit and
vegetables, 28% protein, 7% plants and flowers, 6% beverages and 3% grocery in 2023. Additionally, we have been
able to build upon and benefit from our supplier relationships to deliver supply chain continuity and make progress in
our sustainability agenda. For example, through IPL we are supporting industry projects on water stewardship in our
produce supply chain.

We also believe that IPL has provided greater stability and allowed us greater control over our supply chain
now that the United Kingdom has left the European Union’s single market and customs union. IPL’s EU supply chain
ensures IPL takes control of the transport direct from its suppliers’ sites. This allows IPL to appoint experts in haulage
and freight clearance, removing delays at the various border control points and ensuring the most efficient supply
chain. IPL’s logistics team are based in Spain, which is the top EU exporting country into the United Kingdom for
fresh produce. This has ensured IPL quickly understands any impacts to supply chains, such as localised disruption
by the farming fraternity, allowing IPL to take actions to protect the supply chains.

_We are supported by a significant asset portfolio_

We are supported by a well-invested and geographically diversified store estate and benefit from a total real
estate portfolio of £8.5 billion, which is comprised of freehold and long leasehold assets, and includes £756 million
of certain properties owned by the Group but pledged as collateral for the benefit of the creditors under the Ground
Rent Facility.

As of December 31, 2023, 77% of our asset portfolio was comprised of freehold or long leaseholds, based
upon attributable EBITDAR per property (less central allocations), with certain adjustments made to align the
calculation methodology across the Group’s properties following the EG UK Acquisition and the Arthur Acquisition.
Of this 77%, 12% is attributable to certain properties that are pledged as collateral for the benefit of the creditors under
the Ground Rent Facility.

Our valuable real estate portfolio also provides a potential source of liquidity and underpins our strong
ongoing cash flow generation. On August 10, 2023, we completed the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions with
Realty Income, which resulted in proceeds of £646 million that were used to finance a portion of the EG UK
Acquisition. On December 12, 2023, we also completed the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction with a number of investors,
which resulted in proceeds of £400 million that were used to repay a bridge loan that was used to finance a portion of
the EG UK Acquisition. In the future we may continue to selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to
take advantage of favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities. See “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—2023 Sale and Leaseback Facility” and “Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Ground Rent Transactions – Ground Rent Facility.”_

**_We have strong exposure to the resilient convenience and PFS channel with upside through synergies_**

In December 2022, we opened our first two convenience sites under the Asda Express banner. We also have
further organic Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in early 2024 and a strong pipeline of
approximately 30 sites that have been identified for potential opening in 2024.

The Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition gave us a strong presence in the fast-growing
convenience market, having added 472 convenience sites and petrol filling stations to our portfolio. The Arthur
Acquisition comprised 116 convenience stores with PFSs attached and the EG UK Acquisition comprised 356 PFSs
(including two that have since been shut) with convenience stores and 124 standalone foodservice sites (including 10
non-active sites). These acquisitions accelerated our growth in the convenience sector and strategic ambition to bring
our value heritage as a consumer champion to even more customers. We completed the conversion of all the sites
acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in March 2024. See also “—
_Business Strategy—Location.” We believe our recent acquisitions will drive our results by delivering additional net_
working capital and EBITDA synergies as we integrate buying for the wider convenience network into Asda and seek
to drive higher volumes and growth as a result of price investment in the fuel and grocery offering. We also expect
synergies to arise from range optimisation, monetisation of customer data, our increased scale, in-store marketing
income, improvement in fuel card terms and operational efficiencies. See “Summary Historical Consolidated
_Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_

According to Euromonitor, in 2023, the UK convenience market was approximately £44 billion and the UK
foodservice market was approximately £67 billion, and the UK convenience market has grown at a faster rate than the
UK grocery retail market relative to 2015. Our exposure to these highly attractive and profitable convenience and
foodservice markets is underpinned by favourable structural factors including (i) the rise of shopping locally, (ii) the
evolution of shopper missions, (ii) the shift of our offering to a broader format of retail destinations, and (iv) our shift
into the foodservice and consumption market.

**_We have achieved a successful financial profile_**

We have achieved a successful financial profile that is underpinned by strong profit margins, Adjusted
EBITDA margins, cash flows from operating activities, Free Cash Flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital
Expenditure KPI) and Cash Conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years.
Between the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2023, our average profit margin (defined as profit for the year
divided by revenue) was 4.3%, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.2% (including fuel), our cash flows from
operating activities totalled £3,340.6 million, cumulative free cash flow was approximately £2,097 million and our
average cash conversion was 68%. This strong financial performance is driven by our commitment to deliver low
prices to our clients, diverse product offer, strong own-brand grocery offer, expanded convenience and foodservice
offerings and well-established George-branded product categories. Our Adjusted EBITDA margins have benefitted
from our cost transformation programmes, which have generated SG&A cost savings without compromising the low
prices we offer our customers.

We are a structurally negative working capital business driven by growth in payables, and the beneficial
payment terms to suppliers versus payments received by consumers instantly on purchase. We delivered a strong net
working capital performance in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, with our active working capital
management, resulting in increased working capital inflows in those two years. Furthermore, we have pursued a
disciplined approach to our capital expenditure over time, with the aim of maintaining and improving our real estate
platform rather than opening new sites.

**_We have a highly experienced and execution focused management team_**

We are led by an experienced, entrepreneurial management team that is committed to continuing our strong
track record of growth, with a focus on product quality, delivering low prices to our customers and exceptional
customer service. Together with Michael Gleeson, the Group’s chief financial officer, our executive committee
provides strong, dynamic and deep, leadership. We also benefit from the long-standing experience, market expertise,
business relationships and industry know-how of our shareholder, Mohsin Issa, who is leading the management team
on an interim basis.

169


-----

As we continue to expand our footprint and achieve our business goals, we plan to take advantage of
opportunities to further enhance and supplement our management talent, both from inside our organisation as well as
with external candidates. We have made key investments into our digital marketing team and expect to onboard a new
chief digital officer in the third quarter of 2024. Our search for a permanent chief executive officer is robust and
ongoing.

**Business Strategy**

Our primary strategy is designed to provide great value for money and to bring brighter living within
everyone’s reach. Our strategy is centred around four primary pillars which guide our business priorities and planning:
proposition, product, location and experience. These pillars are underpinned by our commitment to running an
efficient operating model, driving the business through improved data and systems and an ESG programme that builds
a sustainable business for the long term.

Through our strategy, we seek to maintain and extend our advantage in offering value for money by ensuring
that our prices are competitive and reassuring shoppers on quality. We aim to provide a consistent, trusted experience,
incentivising customers not to shop elsewhere through the creation of attractive store propositions and partnerships
that increase our appeal to customers. We serve our customers with our team of flexible and engaged colleagues, while
increasing the number of self-serve opportunities and transforming the in-store experience. We focus our growth
where customers care, expanding our addressable markets in online grocery, wholesale and community convenience.

We believe that our strategy provides a clear path to achieve our ambition of becoming the second-largest
grocer in the United Kingdom by market share.

**_Proposition_**

Our proposition strategy is about creating more reasons to shop with us than anywhere else and providing an
offering that meets all of our customers’ needs under one roof. Demonstrating the strength in our offering across the
store, we recently won four awards at the 2023 annual Grocer Gold Awards, including the Grocer 33 Price award for
the 26th consecutive year, the ‘Own Label Range of the Year’ award for our Just Essentials product range, the
‘Consumer Initiative of the Year’ award for our Kids Eat for £1 Cafe Meals scheme and ‘Online Supermarket of the
Year.’

We believe we are well established as the lowest-price full-selection retailer in the United Kingdom, and we
lead the traditional grocers in terms of lowest price. Moving forward, we intend to reduce the complexity of the
customer shopping experience so that we can reflect that benefit to customers’ prices where it matters most in our
value proposition. We aim to simplify our value proposition to maintain price leadership, further improve quality
perception and continue to improve customer experience in-store and online. We also strive to create a more
hassle-free customer experience in-store with our digital transformation. For example, we have broadened our
Scan&Go services that allows customers to use a handset or the Scan&Go mobile app to scan and bag items as they
shop and utilise a dedicated checkout area for quick and easy payment.

We have also transformed our approach to rewarding customer loyalty through the launch of Asda Rewards
in 2022, our innovative, app-based loyalty scheme that gives customers Asda pounds, not points. Customers earn cash
back on their shopping, with regularly updated missions and star products enabling extra savings. Since 2022, more
than 5 million of our customers enrolled in Asda Rewards and as of December 31, 2023, Asda Rewards resulted in a
total of £383 million customer savings since it was first trialled. Following this initial success, we plan to look into
different ways to offer even further value to our customers, “gamefy” the application and to monetise and utilise the
data it provides. We believe that this approach will allow us to grow our customer analytics platform to bring better,
faster and deeper customer insights to our investment decisions and to improve the overall customer experience by
personalising our offer.

Through Asda Rewards, we are also able to roll out seasonal offerings such as our Christmas Saver Cashpot
that enabled customers save up their cash pot earnings in preparation for the festive period, with approximately 1.7
million members saving approximately £50 million into their 2023 Christmas Cashpots. We offered saving incentives
where customers who transferred savings earned from their Asda Rewards cash pot into their Christmas Saver Cashpot
received additional cash bonuses based upon the amount transferred. With improved availability and seasonal

170


-----

offerings, we continue to earn our place in customers’ minds as the retailer for key celebrations throughout the year.
We believe that such rewards incentives will further drive customer loyalty and retention.

In non-food, we have begun trialling a number of initiatives across clothing and general merchandise in our
“lab stores.” We use the lab-store as a platform to test new technologies, concepts and ideas and assess what works
for customers and colleagues. For example, we tested a “shop within a shop” concept with our Big Asda Toyshop,
which had its own merchandising and look and feel, in eight stores in 2022. Following strong sales, we have rolled it
out in an additional 121 stores. For Halloween in 2023, we trialled a new approach to the store entrance, creating an
inviting and festive shopping environment. Through these and other concepts, we have overhauled the in-store
shopping experience, radically rethinking our use of space, lighting and merchandising and are looking at how to
replicate with new themes and categories on a regular basis across the portfolio.

We also aim to grow Asda as a platform by forming partnerships that enable us to provide a broader set of
relevant branded products and services, while also building upon our existing capabilities, such as logistics and our
customer-facing ‘toyou’ proposition. We believe adding partners to our platform will result in the creation of appealing
“one-stop-shop” store destinations for more customer missions. We believe these partnerships will not only provide
additional income through rent and revenue share models but will also create a positive effect on our overall business.

**_Product_**

Our goal under our product strategy is to make desirable products affordable. We aim to modernise our brand
and deliver the best value to our customers, helping them fulfil their money saving goals without needing to
compromise on quality.

We began our product transformation in 2022 with the overhaul of our opening price point range, Just
Essentials by Asda. This line is a key part of our strategy to make desirable products that are affordable. In 2023, we
also locked in the price of over 500 popular products until the end of the summer to give customers certainty around
their budgets. We delivered three key price drops in 2023, lowering the prices on over 800 high volume lines, including
in October 2023 where we lowered prices by an average of 14% on many of our popular products. We will look to
continue dropping prices where possible and aim to pass price drops straight onto customers where we can. As inflation
is starting to ease in certain areas, we are working with our suppliers and IPL to ensure our customers feel the benefit
of those reductions.

As part of this brand reset, we are also focused on our mid-tier value and range offerings, investing throughout
our own brand offering to drive customers to reappraise us on quality. We launched our new scratch cooking and meal
solutions ranges and have introduced new own-label meal solutions brands, including Health Menu, Take-Out Club,
the Indian-inspired Bom Bahia and pan-Asian-inspired House of Yum ranges, and Bistro, a selection of hearty
pub-style favourites. These ranges are designed to compete directly with the likes of M&S Gastropub and takeaway
brands, a key opportunity as customers switch to at-home spending amidst cost-of-living pressures. We launched
ambitious quality and taste match campaigns during 2023 to demonstrate our confidence in the quality and value of
our products, including Harrod’s blind taste test products and M&S Taste Match campaign across a range of popular
household items. In the M&S Taste Match campaign, hundreds of our products were voted “as tasty” or “tastier than”
their M&S equivalents, but at a lower cost, in a blind taste testing conducted by Cambridge Market Research.

Foodservice and chilled categories also represent an avenue for growth and are important in moving the dial
on customers’ quality perception. A strong proposition in these categories is essential for fulfilling our ambition of
becoming a key market player in the convenience market.

In non-food, we launched ‘Exclusively at George’ in May 2023, which was dubbed the first-ever supermarket
elevated fashion collection. It put a spotlight on high-quality fabrics, with a focus on both quality and style. Following
the success of ‘Exclusively at George,’ we introduced the Studio Edit, which will be a permanent premium arm of the
George range, with a focus on wardrobe staples, premiere fabrics and finishing touches typically found in more
expensive pieces. Continuing in the elevated lifestyle space, we partnered with TV presenter and influencer Stacey
Solomon to create the homeware range, ‘At Home with Stacey Solomon Exclusively for George Home’ in
August 2023. We believe these lines showcase our ability to deliver high quality, highly desired products across a
broad range of categories to meet our customers’ every day needs.

**_Location_**

As part of our location strategy, we seek to be accessible however and whenever we are needed. We believe
that customers seeing Asda in new locations and new formats will help us broaden our customer base. In 2022, we
made significant progress in our location strategic priority area, increasing our expansion into the convenience sector.
Our core focus in our location strategy is on the successful integration of the recent Arthur Acquisition and EG UK
Acquisition, which together added 472 convenience sites and petrol filling stations and 124 standalone foodservice
sites to our portfolio.

In September 2023, we began the conversion of the Co-op sites from Co-op branding to our Asda Express
banner, implementing Asda pricing across fuel and grocery upon conversion. We completed the conversion of the
remaining convenience sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in
March 2024. We believe we will be able to bring Asda’s great value to even more customers across the United
Kingdom by reaching new communities and shoppers with this smaller store format. In the converted Co-op sites, our
Asda Express prices were an average of 6.1% cheaper than their corresponding prices under Co-op ownership. We
also have further organic Asda Express openings planned to bolster our location strategy. Going forward, our focus
will be on the continued integration of the Co-op sites and EG UK Business into the Asda Group and delivering
synergies.

Beyond our expansion into the convenience market, we plan to continue to drive growth and market share
gains in the online channel through the expansion of our online grocery channel’s capacity to meet increased consumer
demand. We continue to seek to optimise our online grocery operating model and further develop our already
profitable economic model through the ongoing assessment of our online product range and promotions, further
monetisation of our e-commerce assets, as well as other initiatives. In addition to growing our core online grocery
business, we are targeting further growth by expanding the reach of our online platform and expanding our delivery
services. We expect to provide customers with greater and more convenient access to our product range by accelerating
our last-mile delivery capabilities via partnerships.

**_Experience_**

The goal of our experience strategy is to make shopping with us easy and enjoyable. We are focused on
operational excellence, testing scalable operational innovation for end-to-end service improvement. We are currently
looking at changes to further improve availability in store, improve stock flow and drive effective labour management.
For example, we are trialling artificial intelligence (“AI”) cameras to identify gaps in product availability and optimise
stock management in store. We believe this is an example of how AI could significantly help improve the customer
experience and optimise our colleagues’ time to focus on delivering high quality service.

We are also striving towards a best-in-class shopping experience that gives customers the range they desire
in an environment that’s easy to navigate. Our current store design had not been updated for many years, so our
near-term strategy includes modernising our stores to facilitate a better customer journey.

In order to ensure our colleagues are equipped to offer a best-in-class customer experience, we are also
investing in colleague hours in-store via a combination of additional temporary colleagues in stores and opportunities
for existing colleagues to work over-time if they wish to. Increasing the numbers of hours being worked in store means
that more colleagues are on hand to serve customers across the busy and peak periods (such as Christmas). Alongside
value and choice, we believe that service is a key quality signifier for customers and impacts where they choose to
shop. To help further this strategy, we also hired David Hills as our new Chief Customer Officer in September 2023,
who brings a wealth of retail and grocery-sector experience to our business and will play a pivotal role in providing
our shoppers a hassle-free and pleasurable experience when shopping at Asda.

**_Commitment to ESG targets and building a sustainable business for the long term_**

Part of our strategy is to ensure our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) commitments are fully
integrated into our wider business transformation plans. We believe the sales opportunity driven by eco-active
shoppers, or shoppers who are highly concerned about the environment and are actively taking actions to reduce their
waste, is expected to reach approximately £2 billion across the market by the year 2027. We believe ESG is a key

172


-----

decision enabler for customers in deciding where to shop and that setting the right ESG plan is beneficial for our
customers, colleagues and investors.

Our ESG strategy is focused on four pillars: healthy and sustainable choices (providing our customers with
a product mix that is healthier and with a lower environmental impact), energy and climate change mitigation
(reducing our greenhouse gas emissions), nature positive (sourcing and farming which respects and restores) and waste
(reducing food, product and packaging waste). In August 2023, we published our third ESG report (based on 2022
data), which provided an annual update on the progress we had made towards supporting these pillars and meeting
our environmental targets and in October 2023, we received our first external assessment of our ESG strategy, with
an entity score of 54 points and an overall rating of 3 (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the strongest) by the financial
services ratings’ agency Sustainable Fitch. Sustainable Fitch positively assessed our human and labour rights policies,
gender balanced workforce and well-defined management systems, as well as our actions to increase the share of
non-high fat, salt and sugar own-brand products and improve food nutrition labelling. Obtaining this rating is part of
our ongoing commitment to transparently reporting on our efforts to achieve our ESG targets. For example, we have
continued to reduce our operational carbon footprint, with emissions down 8% from 2021 to 2022 and 40% from 2015
to 2022, and we believe we are well on the way to achieving our commitment to reduce emissions 50% by 2025 and
reaching net zero emissions by 2040. We have committed to setting a near-term science-based carbon reduction target,
including a specific Forests, Land and Agriculture (“FLAG”) target. These targets have been submitted to the
Science-Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”) for validation. The proposed targets were submitted before the Arthur
Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition so reflect our footprint prior to these acquisitions.

In terms of waste reduction, over 90% of our own brand packaging was recyclable in 2022, and we donated
over 2,000 tonnes of surplus food through our charity partnerships, both reducing waste and supporting those in need
during challenging times. We increased the proportion of our own-label packaging that can be recycled at the kerbside
to 88% (with a further 4.7% recyclable in store) and introduced the Refill Price Guarantee on our in-store refill zones,
guaranteeing that unpackaged products are cheaper than their packaged equivalents. We reused or repurposed 86% of
our operational waste and sent zero operational waste to landfill in 2022.

We believe we have made significant progress towards our ESG goals but that there is still much to do, and
we will continue working to build a sustainable business for the long term.

**Our Businesses**

We are an omni-channel retailer centred around a brick-and-mortar store network, which is geographically
diversified across the United Kingdom, and our websites (primarily through groceries.asda.com and George.com).
Our retail business comprises a food offer (which in turn comprises produce, ambient products and fresh food products
(including our foodservice offerings)), a non-food offer (which in turn comprises clothing, homeware and general
merchandise offers) and fuel. We also offer our customers other services, including, among other things, a mobile
phone service, various financial products, parcel drop and collection and in-store pharmacies and opticians.

**_Our Retail Business_**

Our retail business comprises a food segment, which consists of our grocery and foodservice business, and a
non-food segment, which includes our well-known George Clothing and George Home brands, as well as a general
merchandise and health and wellness offer.

We operate our retail business through both brick-and-mortar retail sites and through online sales made,
primarily, via groceries.asda.com and George.com.

Our physical retail business operates under five distinct formats: supercentres and superstores, supermarkets,
Asda Living, convenience sites and stand-alone foodservice sites. For more information on our store formats, see “—
_Our Store Formats.”_

We aim to develop Asda as a platform by forming partnerships that enable us to provide a broader set of
relevant branded products and services while also building on our existing capabilities such as logistics and the
customer-facing ‘toyou’ proposition. We believe adding partners to our platform will result in the creation of attractive
store destinations, in which more customer missions can be accomplished under one roof. See “—Business Strategy.”

_Food_

In 2023, our food segment accounted for 86.2% (£18.4 billion) of our total sales of £21.4 billion (excluding
fuel). Within our food segment, in 2023, ambient food items and non-edible items accounted for 53.3% (£9.8 billion),
and fresh/produce accounted for 46.7% (£8.6 billion), of our food sales.

_Ambient_

Our ambient product category includes core grocery items (such as rice, pasta, baking supplies, canned goods,
condiments and cereals), impulse grocery items (such as snacks, confectionary treats, biscuits and soft drinks), beer,
wine, spirits, baby and toiletry items, non-edible grocery items (such as paper products, pet care supplies, cleaning
supplies and laundry-related items), newspapers, magazines and other kiosk items, pharmacy (including health
products and ambient medicines) and optical products. We believe that certain of our own-brand ambient products,
such as our Little Angels nappies and our Shades toilet rolls, are among the most popular products of their kind on the
market.

We continue to expand the range of our plant-based and vegan food products within our overall ambient food
selection. New items offered included vegan and plant-based proteins, cooking sauces, condiments, snacks and sweets
marketed under our Plant Based by Asda and Asda OMV! offers that we released at the beginning of 2023.

Our fresh product category includes core chilled products (such as cheese, cooked meats, pies, salads and
dips, eggs and dairy products), fresh proteins (such as fresh beef, fresh pork, fresh poultry, bacon, sausage and
pre-packed fish), bakery (such as cakes, breads and morning goods bought and produced in store), in-store café (such
as beverages, main meals, snacks and drinks), foodservice (such as sandwiches, snacks, confectionary treats, salads
and drinks), serve-over and self-serve counters (such as rotisserie, pizza, Panku, Sushi Daily, Kulaba Kitchen, Asda
takeaway and various local partners), frozen (such as frozen meat, chips, vegetables, desserts, ice cream and frozen
meal solutions) fresh ready meals, soups and pizzas.

_Foodservice_

Following the EG UK Acquisition, we expanded our foodservice offerings. Our foodservice partners include
Greggs, Subway, Burger King and Sbarro, as well as our own proprietary brand, Leon. In addition to these
Group-operated branded offerings, the sites acquired from the EG UK Acquisition will also continue to benefit from
additional KFC and Starbucks branded offerings operated by third parties. Outside of our convenience and foodservice
sites, we also work with a number of strategic partners that operate retail locations within our grocery stores, such as
McDonalds and Sushi Daily. See “—Our Tenants and Strategic Partners.”

We have 509 branded foodservice outlets across our foodservice and convenience sites. Certain of our sites
have multiple brand offerings at an individual location. The following table shows the number of outlets by brand

**_Our Other Services_**

_Asda Pharmacy and Asda Opticians_

We operate complementary pharmacy and optical businesses that offer enhanced customer experiences and
diversify our cash flows.

As of December 31, 2023, we have 247 Asda Pharmacies offering NHS, locally commissioned and private
services to our patients. These services include dispensing NHS and private prescriptions, electronic prescriptions and
collection services as well as our Asda Pharmacy flu vaccine service for NHS and private patients. Examples of NHS
services we offer include our New Medicine Service in England, Pharmacy First in Scotland and our Common Ailment
scheme in Wales, each of which are commissioned by the home nations.

Asda Opticians offers our customers access to optical services and products in 157 stores and has a dedicated
online site selling contact lenses. In our stores, we complete eye examinations, contact lens examinations, provide
additional NHS services and dispense optical appliances (spectacles and contact lenses). Our in-store spectacle pricing
model does not charge extra to patients for prescription needs, including varifocals. We offer a wide contact lens
portfolio of various brands, designs and modalities. We also offer safety spectacles, sunglasses, eye care products,
accessories and contact lens solutions.

_Asda Money_

We offer certain financial and insurance products on a commission-only basis. All products are provided
through third-party partnerships. The products we offer include home insurance, car insurance, travel insurance, pet
insurance, money transfer, breakdown cover, third-party gift cards, personal loans, credit cards and travel money. See
also “Regulation—Regulation Relating to our Money and Insurance Offers.”

_Asda Gift Cards_

We offer Asda branded gift cards for sale in our stores and on our dedicated websites, which can be used to
buy goods in-store, on George.com or to purchase online groceries. Our gift card offer includes Asda’s Christmas
Savings Card, an Asda-branded card that pays a bonus to customers in November based on how much they have saved
on their card up to that date. We also participate in pre-paid card schemes through our business-to-business gift card
programme, through which a commission is paid to businesses to encourage end-users to shop at Asda. Businesses
who purchase Asda gift cards can also receive a discount on bulk purchases.

_Asda Mobile_

Asda Mobile operates as a Mobile Network Virtual Operator, offering pay-as-you-go mobile services to
customers. Asda Mobile was launched on the EE network. In 2020, we entered into an exclusive five-year agreement
with Vodafone to begin operating Asda Mobile. Our mobile network transitioned to Vodafone during the first half of
2021, and Asda Mobile on the EE network ceased in September 2021. As of December 31, 2023, we have
approximately 220,000 customers on the Vodafone network.

We sell our SIM cards in our stores at dedicated bays alongside mobile handsets. We also operate a dedicated
website where customers can order a SIM card. See also “Regulation—Regulations Relating to Our Mobile Offer.”

_Other Service Offers_

We also offer our customers other services, including our ‘toyou’ service, which allows customers to collect
and return orders from partner retailers at Asda locations, Asda Tyres (which sells tyres and connects customers to
local tyre fitting services via a dedicated online shop), and Asda Media Partnerships (an advertising service helping
brands to reach and influence Asda’s customers through digital, social, in-store and out-of-store advertising
opportunities).

**_Our Online Platform_**

We offer online grocery shopping through our online Asda groceries platform, including delivery services
for our customers’ online orders, as well as our Click & Collect service. We also offer our popular George Clothing
and homeware range online through George.com. For the year ended December 31, 2023, £3.6 billion of our sales
were through our online platform (of which £3.2 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com
sales).

_Asda groceries_

Asda groceries is our online groceries business. We sell our groceries through groceries.asda.com and our
mobile application. Customers place an order either for delivery or for collection from one of approximately 460 Click
& Collect sites. Delivery orders are fulfilled either from our home shopping centres, which are dedicated fulfilment
centres for online grocery orders, or from Asda stores, depending on the customer’s location. This in-store online
model proved effective in responding to rapid increases in demand during the COVID-19-related lockdowns in the
United Kingdom and we believe this demonstrates our ability to scale our online offering quickly to meet customer
demand.

Our online delivery covers a comprehensive portion of the United Kingdom and delivery to customers is
primarily made by Asda colleagues using our van fleet. For deliveries, customers book a delivery slot and can choose
to either pay per delivery or to sign up for a monthly or annual delivery pass, allowing customers up to one delivery
per day on orders over £40 for a fixed price.

The COVID-19 pandemic increased the use of and engagement with our online platforms. In the first half of
2021, there were approximately 8.6 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with order growth from
approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended
February 28, 2020) to an average of more than 773,000 weekly orders in 2021 (based on the average weekly orders
for the first 26 weeks of 2021) and a peak of more than 850,000 orders during the third lockdown (based on the 7 days
to January 15, 2021). Although online engagement has fallen from the peaks experienced during the COVID-19
pandemic, we have continued to grow our online business, with an average of approximately 774,000 weekly orders
in 2022 and 2023 (based on the average weekly orders in 2022 and 2023).

_George.com_

We sell George Clothing and George Home products online through George.com. Customers place an order
either for delivery or collection from one of approximately 460 Click & Collect sites. Delivery of orders is provided
by third-party couriers, with orders prepared at our three fulfilment centres. George.com also delivers to customers
around the world. Following the Separation, Walmart has agreed to permit us to continue to use the George brand
internationally. For more information about where we will be able to use the George brand following the Separation,
see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart—Trade Mark
_Agreement.”_

In 2019, we launched the George Rewards loyalty scheme, through which customers earn points as they shop
online and can use the points to unlock discounts.

**Our Customers**

We believe that our value proposition is particularly attractive to value-seeking families, younger shoppers
and lower-income customers. The following chart presents the life stage and income bracket distribution of our
customer base.

_(Source: Kantar Worldpanel, Take Home, Grocery, 52 w/e January 21[st] 2024, Shoppers. Note: Income Brackets are classified based on the_
_following: Class A: Higher managerial, administrative and professional; Class B: Intermediate managerial, administrative and_
_professional; Class C1: Supervisory, clerical and junior managerial, administrative and professional; Class C2: Skilled manual workers;_
_Class D: Semi-skilled and unskilled manual worker s; Class E: State pensioners, casual and lowest grade workers, unemployed with state_
_benefits only.)_

A key component of our strategy is to provide great quality and value to our customers and we are focused
on initiatives supporting our customers who are faced with cost-of-living pressures. In May 2022, we launched a new
grocery opening price point range, Just Essentials by Asda. This range replaced the existing budget offering, Asda
Smart Price, expanding the range from approximately 160 to 272 products with new branding and products
reformulated for taste and quality. The total range is designed to enable customers to keep the household running on
a budget. The range is a key part of our strategy to make desirable products affordable, giving customers the
opportunity to reappraise our quality and value offering.

Throughout 2022, our Asda Rewards programme was introduced as an indirect cost-saving scheme for
customers to earn cash back on their shopping and we also ran our “Dropped and Locked” price campaign, which was
aimed at supporting UK households tackling inflation. The “Dropped and Locked” campaign locked in the prices of
over 100 grocery items, including fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh meat, store cupboard favourites like rice and
noodles, as well as soft drinks, desserts, frozen products and non-HFSS (as defined below) products. As a result, prices
on these products dropped by an average of 12% and locked until the end of 2022 to give customers certainty around
their shopping in light of these cost-of-living pressures. In 2023, we continued our commitment to our customers
through various price drop and freezing initiatives and in 2024, we introduced “Fab 5,” which offers our customers
five of our “fabulous” quality fruit and vegetables (on a weekly basis) at a low price of under £1, both in store and
online.

**Our Brands**

We operate generally under our well-known Asda brand, for groceries, and George brand, for clothing,
footwear, general merchandise and homeware.

178


-----

**_Own-branded food products_**

We have particular strength with our own-brand food products, including, among others, Just Essentials by
Asda (our opening price point brand), Asda (our mid-tier brand), Asda Farm Stores (our line of high-quality fresh and
affordable food drawing on Asda’s long-standing farming heritage and working closely with our approved farms,
growers and suppliers), Asda Extra Special (our premium product offer) and Asda Free From (our food offer for
specific dietary requirements, such as gluten-free diets). In 2023, we also launched two new vegan ranges, Plant Based
by Asda and Asda OMV! to meet increase customer demand for plant-based eating. The OMV! range offers indulgent
meat-free meals and delicious snacks, whilst the Plant Based range provides healthy meat alternatives.

In the 52 weeks ended January 26, 2024, our own-brand products accounted for 55.8% of our food volumes,
which comprise the categories of core groceries, impulse groceries, bakery products, chilled products, fresh meat,
poultry and fish, frozen products, meal solutions and produce, and 44.3% of our sales value, across the same
categories. Our own-branded product offer includes approximately 7,800 SKUs.

Our approach to range development and innovation enables us to identify and meet changing customer needs
and resulted in the creation of many award-winning products; we launched approximately 950 new lines in 2021,
1,547 new lines in 2022 and 1,597 new lines in 2023, and approximately 3,858 lines were reformulated in 2023. We
are focused on building more inclusive product ranges, as demonstrated by the launch of Plant Based by Asda and
Asda OMV! in the first quarter of 2023.

In our own-brand products, we are committed to sustainability: we have set goals of using an average
minimum of 30% recycled content across all of our own-brand plastic packaging and to having 100% recyclable
own-brand packaging by 2025. As of December 31, 2022, 93% of our own-brand packaging was recyclable at home
or in our stores.

**_George_**

The George brand is another point of strength for us: George Clothing, which we sell in our stores and on
George.com, was the number three clothing, footwear and accessories retailer by volume of units sold in the United
Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024 and is a complementary offer to our grocery business. We also sell
George homewares in stores and online under George Home. The George brand was launched in 1990 and launched
online in 2008. George Clothing is a sizeable, well-established and profitable business, with a leading market share
and position in childrenswear. The graph below shows our market position and market share in the UK clothing,
footwear and accessories market by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024.

179


-----

Clothing, which includes clothing, footwear and accessories, is a core component of our non-food offer and
is a business line that benefits from strong margins when compared to food categories, as well as exclusive sourcing
partnerships with third parties that has resulted in savings of £54 million in the last five years. In 2023, 49.4% of the
value of our non-food sales were George Clothing sales and 25.3% of the value of our non-food sales were George
Home sales.

The George Clothing product line is a sizeable business with strong online growth. According to Kantar
Worldpanel, in the 24 weeks ended January 7, 2024, 26.1% (37.7 million units) of our 144.3 million units in clothing,
footwear and accessory sales were made online, with the remaining 73.9% (106.6 million units) being made in our
stores.

Online sales participation for George.com has improved in recent years. The chart below shows the online
sales participation and year-on-year growth of George.com clothing sales for the periods presented.

_(Source: Asda information.)_

The George Home brand is growing, having expanded to over £747.7 million of general merchandise sales
since inception 10 years ago and contributing approximately 50.0% of general merchandise sales in the year ended
December 31, 2023.

**_Leon_**

Leon is a fast-food chain based in the United Kingdom and was established in 2004. It touts itself a fast-food
restaurant with a twist: serving fresh meals with healthy, nutritious food and a strong emphasis on vegan and vegetarian
dishes complimented by high quality meat offerings. We acquired all of Leon’s owned and operated locations as part
of the EG UK Acquisition, which excludes certain franchised locations for which we now act as franchisor. Our Leon
operations include 54 locations, one of which is co-located at a PFS and one of which is co-located at our headquarters.
See “Our Businesses—Our Retail Business—Food—Fresh—Foodservice.” We do not count the franchised locations
among our 54 Leon outlets.

**Our Store Formats**

We believe we have a well-invested and geographically diversified store estate. As of December 31, 2023,
77% of our asset portfolio was comprised of freeholds or long leaseholds, based upon attributable EBITDAR per
property (less central allocations), with certain adjustments made to align the calculation methodology across the
Group’s properties following the EG UK Acquisition and the Arthur Acquisition. Of this 77%, 12% is attributable to
certain properties that are pledged as collateral for the benefit of the creditors under the Ground Rent Facility.
Alternatively, as of December 31, 2023 and calculated as the number of freehold operating retail units as a percentage
of total number of operating retail units, 52.6% of our asset portfolio was freehold; freehold percentage also includes

180


-----

certain properties that are freehold with a partial leasehold or which are leasehold properties for which the leases have
been classed as long leasehold for the purposes of this calculation as those leases have nil or a peppercorn ground rent.
We have made around £500 million cumulative investment in the estate between 2021 and 2023.

We operate five distinct store formats: (i) supercentres and superstores, (ii) supermarkets, (iii) Asda Living,
(iv) convenience and (v) foodservice.

    - _Supercentres and superstores: Supercentres are our largest stores (typically exceeding a net sales area_
of 80,000 square feet), offering our extended range across food, George and non-food, often supported
by partnership offers and an extended range of services through photo printing specialists, dry cleaners,
pharmacies, opticians, cafés and fuel. Superstores are large supermarkets (with a net sales area ranging
between 15,000 and 80,000 square feet), providing a more limited non-food offer and a smaller range of
services than our supercentres including through photo printing specialists, dry cleaners, pharmacies,
opticians, cafés and fuel.

    - Supermarkets: Supermarkets are our small, usually local, stores (with a net sales area of less than 15,000
square feet) typically providing customers with a selected food range that, offers general groceries such
as food, beverage and household non-food products. Our supermarkets do not typically offer extended
services apart from fuel.

    - Asda Living: Asda Living are dedicated general merchandise stores, containing selected non-food ranges
including our George Clothing and George Home offers, home electronics, toys, homewares, health, and
beauty products.

    - Convenience: Our convenience offering consists of two offerings.

        - Conveniently located small non-fuel stores (with a net sales area of less than 3,000 square feet)
that offer a wide variety of food-for-now or food-for-later ranges and includes a selected ranges
of household products. As of December 31, 2023, we have nine convenience stores.

        - Petrol filling station (“PFS”) usually complemented by a retail space for small consumable
purchases. As of December 31, 2023, we have 490 PFSs. For more information on these retail
spaces, see “Our Businesses—Our Retail Business—Food—Fresh—Foodservice.”

    - _Foodservice: Our foodservice stores format includes stand-alone stores containing either (i) a fast-food_
outlet offering a selection of branded fast-food counters, or (ii) a Leon food outlet, all located in
convenient locations. For more information about our foodservice brand offerings, see “Our
_Businesses—Our Retail Business—Food—Fresh—Foodservice.”_

We work with a number of tenants and strategic partners that operate retail locations within our grocery
stores, such as McDonalds, Sushi Daily, Timpson, Decathlon and Claire’s, or provide other services to our customers,
such as UberEats, Deliveroo and Just Eat which provide grocery home delivery.

**Our Colleagues**

As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 150,000 individuals. Our retail colleagues make up
the largest proportion of this, with approximately 85% of our workforce serving customers in store, 9% in the
distribution network, and 4% in home offices and 2% in other operations. Typically, our total number of colleagues
increases during peak retail periods, such as Easter and Christmas, due to seasonal hires.

We are committed to providing colleagues the training, education and incentives they need to strengthen their
skills and become part of our community.

Our colleagues are subject to standard employment terms, depending on their role, and are provided with
colleague handbooks (where relevant) and policies. We have trade union agreements in Asda’s retail and distribution
businesses as well as in Asda Express. In our retail business, we have a collective bargaining agreement for hourly-paid
colleagues in Northern Ireland and a partnership agreement with the GMB Union (“GMB”) for hourly-paid colleagues
who are GMB members in England, Scotland and Wales. In our distribution business, we have a collective bargaining
agreement with the GMB for hourly-paid colleagues and a collective bargaining agreement with Unite the Union
(“Unite”) and the United Road Transport Union for colleagues in our Lutterworth chilled distribution centre. For Asda
Express, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (“Usdaw”) have collective bargaining agreements for
hourly and salaried colleagues in sites acquired in connection with the Arthur Acquisition. We recently entered into a
collective bargaining agreement with Usdaw for hourly-paid colleagues in Leon, in sites acquired in connection with
the EG UK Acquisition and that will be in any new Asda Express site. The GMB partnership agreement covers eight
legacy Asda Express sites.

We are committed to offering competitive compensation in line with market practices and supporting our
colleagues during this high inflationary environment. For example, in April 2023, we voluntarily increased our rate
for hourly-paid store colleagues to £11.00 an hour and further increased this in July 2023 to £11.11 an hour. For stores
inside the M25 and around Greater London, our rate for hourly-paid store colleagues increased to £12.28. For
information related to certain ongoing legal proceedings relating to wages, please see “—Legal Proceedings—Equal
_Value Litigation.” We also offer variable compensation to colleagues, including those working in retail and_
distribution, to encourage performance based on the fulfilment of business targets.

**Our Suppliers and Logistics**

We operate a “hub and spoke” logistics network, with two hubs and two deconsolidation centres serving 23
depots across the United Kingdom. Our logistics model is designed to support our extensive store and online
businesses. This approach starts with suppliers that provide goods to our hubs and depots as well as directly to our
stores for certain products. Our hubs and depots supply our stores via our fleet. In addition to in-store purchasing,
Asda and Asda Logistics Services (“ALS”) also offer customers home-delivery and Click & Collect services.

    - _Hubs. Our two hubs are split by category: our Lutterworth hub handles general merchandise and ambient_
goods, while our Doncaster hub, which is operated by a third party, handles general merchandise and
ambient products.

    - Suppliers. We work closely with over 5,900 active supplier accounts as of December 31, 2023. The top
20 of our goods for resale (“GFR”) suppliers (excluding IPL and fuel) reflected approximately 29.5%

182


-----

of cost of goods sold to GFR suppliers (excluding VAT, for the year ended December 31, 2023), while
the top 20 goods not for resale (“GNFR”) suppliers (excluding IPL and fuel) reflected approximately
51.8% of costs of goods sold to GNFR suppliers. These suppliers deliver goods either to a hub (such as
for ambient and non-edible products and non-food products), direct to depots (such as for fresh food,
produce and fast-moving ambient) or direct to stores (such as for bread). New suppliers undergo a
number of checks and procedures managed via the shared service centre team. If a supplier is identified
as a third-party intermediary, which is typically only relevant to goods not for resale suppliers presenting
a bribery and corruption risk, further procedures are required as part of the on-boarding and ongoing
management processes for that supplier, focused on anti-corruption. During the on-boarding of goods
not for resale suppliers, we undertake a compliance risk review covering topics including, among others,
modern slavery, information security and privacy. If compliance risks are identified, then we agree on
and implement appropriate mitigation measures. Relationships with goods for resale suppliers are
managed by the relevant buying team within the commercial team. Our buyers are responsible for
negotiating key terms, including pricing, promotional activity, supplier income arrangements, and
payment terms. For goods not for resale suppliers, the applicable business owners manage the contract
terms and arrangements. We leverage supplier relationships to deliver supply chain continuity.

    - Ordering process. The purchase order process varies according to the category of goods.

        - _GFR: Automatic orders are generated with suppliers based on stock levels / stock availability,_
historical demand trends and forecast trends. This is applicable for the majority of food orders.
The supply team has manual override capabilities for automatic orders, albeit limited and rarely
required. Non-food products typically operate on a longer lead time. The orders are based on
forecast sales numbers provided to the supply team by the buying team and the commercial
finance team.

        - _GFNR: Purchase orders are raised by the procurement team or the applicable colleague and_
reviewed by the budget holder (the individual who is responsible for the budget to which the
associated cost relates) within that colleague’s team.

    - _Logistics facilities. Logistics facilities receive, process, warehouse and distribute goods for sale at our_
stores. IPL, Forza and Kober are treated as suppliers and largely deliver to depots. In addition, we operate
home shopping centres, which are fulfilment centres for online grocery orders.

    - Fleet. Our drivers deliver goods to stores and customers using fleet vehicles (1,367 leased tractors and
2,629 leased trailers), home shopping vans (3,401 leased vans) or occasional spot hire or use of thirdparty hauliers (figures as of December 31, 2023).

    - Stores. aside from in-store purchasing, we also offer our customers home delivery and Click & Collect
service.

**IPL**

We believe we have a competitive advantage in food sourcing via IPL and its two subsidiary companies,
Forza and Kober, which enables a vertically integrated approach to procurement. IPL is an important asset that
provides valuable sourcing differentiation. In 2023, £1,724 million was purchased through IPL, reducing our overall
purchasing costs and delivering strong value to our customers.

Our 2023 product mix sourced from IPL was 55.7% produce, 28.3% protein, 6.6% house plants and flowers,
6.1% beverages and 3.3% grocery. IPL employed over 3,700 colleagues as of December 31, 2023 across its group of
companies, and only serves us. IPL receives products directly from producers and employs centralised sourcing,
transportation and packing. This disintermediation of export agents, import agencies, suppliers and packers is the
foundation of IPL’s cost price advantage: IPL sources fruit and vegetables, cooked meats, wine, nuts and dried fruit,
plants and flowers and has a national footprint of nine processing facilities across the United Kingdom, supported by
two overseas technical/logistical operations. IPL’s overseas offices provide us with the benefit of being close to our
foreign grower partners, which we believe gives us greater insight and control over our supply chain, conferring on

183


-----

us a competitive advantage versus other retailers who do not benefit from comparable vertically integrated
procurement.

The map below shows IPL’s UK footprint.

_(Source: Asda information.)_

IPL operates with five trading business units including produce (sourcing whole fruit and vegetables, potatoes
and onions), protein (sourcing cooked meat and bacon), house plants and flowers (sourcing plants for the home and
flowers), beverages (sourcing wine), grocery (sourcing snack nuts, desserts and baking products, cereal and other nuts
and dried fruit), and with central functions to support these trading business units (by employing colleagues across IT,
finance, legal and compliance and HR functions). The key countries of origin from which we source products via IPL
include the United Kingdom, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and other European Union countries, Morocco, South
Africa, Peru, Thailand and Egypt.

**Our Quality Control System, Health and Safety and Environmental Policies**

**_Quality Control_**

We are committed to providing customers with safe and high-quality products, including both our own-brand
products and name brand products. We have a due diligence framework in place which covers, among other things,
our supplier audit framework, our governance policies, product testing and our specification management system. Our
supplier audit framework measures compliance, supplier performance against food safety hazard analysis and critical
control point principles. In addition, we have a quality management system that measures how our products perform
in terms of quality.

To control the quality of the products we sell, we execute a number of quality control initiatives. We conduct
regular quality controls on the acceptance of fresh food at our depots. In addition, we analyse own-brand product

184


-----

samples in our in-house sensory kitchens and through a third-party, Cambridge Market Research, to ensure that our
products meet our customers’ expectations.

All new own-brand suppliers must be Global Food Safety Initiative accredited and must pass a new supplier
audit before proceeding. In addition, all own-brand suppliers will have an annual unannounced Asda Star Audit that
measures their adherence to Asda policy.

We conduct food safety audits twice a year at our superstores and home shopping centres, and once a year at
our smaller supermarkets and depots, to ensure that each site meets our required standards for food safety and hygiene.
We conduct essential training and department-specific training for store colleagues to ensure that they are trained in
all relevant aspects of food safety related to their department, including allergen management.

When deciding whether to work with an own-brand supplier, we monitor the quality of its products based on
a control of samples delivered by the supplier during the selection phase. Following selection, we regularly evaluate
the quality of the products the supplier offers, including through randomly selected samples. Our general supplier
terms and conditions include a section dedicated to quality, safety, labelling and traceability. By signing these terms
and conditions, our suppliers confirm that they are fully aware of, and comply with, our safety and quality standards.
Furthermore, suppliers must adhere to our technical manufacturing guide and associated policies for food as well as
work with our own-brand technical teams to ensure compliance with this guide and these policies.

**_Health, Safety and Environmental Policies and Ethics_**

We are committed to maintaining high standards of health and safety practices for our colleagues, customers,
visitors, contractors and anyone affected by our business activities. We therefore consider good health, safety and
environmental management as an essential part of our business performance and culture. We formally monitor health
and safety incident rates. Our health and safety policies and procedures include:

    - managing risk and promoting a corporate culture that emphasises the benefits of health and safety;

    - appropriate training and education of all colleagues to support legal compliance and best practices; and

    - proactively conducting regular risk assessments and root cause analyses to provide and maintain safe
and healthy working environments to significantly reduce occupational injuries or illnesses.

We carry out a range of monitoring activities to provide assurance of the effectiveness of our policies and
procedures. These activities are completed by both internal teams and external experts. We have a wide variety of
health and safety and ethics policies that address topics such as Food Safety, Food Contamination, Warehouse Safety,
Product Safety, Fire Safety, Privacy, Environment and Environmental Services, Anti-Money Laundering and Licences
and Permits, among others.

We also have a number of policies that relate specifically to waste management issues, such as Food and
Drink Waste, Confidential Waste, Optical Waste and Pharmacy Waste.

**_Our Environmental, Social and Governance Goals_**

As a major retailer, we believe that we have the ability, and the responsibility, to make a significant impact
on the topics that matter to our stakeholders, such as energy and climate change, food waste, plastic and packaging,
healthy and sustainable choices and the support of local communities (together, our “ESG Priority Areas”), and our
customers want us to play our part in creating solutions that work for everyone. By taking action, we intend to meet
these expectations, but also to strengthen our business for the future so that we can continue to deliver the same value
to our customers.

In 2022, we reassessed our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) programme to ensure it remains
a critical pillar of our growth strategy. Our overarching ESG approach remains focused on providing access and
affordability for customers as the business undergoes a period of transformation and takes account of the external
environment in which we operate.

185


-----

In October 2023, we received our first external assessment of our ESG strategy with an overall rating of 3
(on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the strongest) by the financial services ratings’ agency Sustainable Fitch as part of our
ongoing commitment to transparently report on our efforts to achieve our ESG targets. We also received an entity
score of 54 (on a scale of 0 to 100).

_Our ESG Priority Areas_

_Energy and Climate Change Mitigation_

_Carbon Emissions_

Our carbon footprint is nearly equally split between the transportation of goods and refrigerants and natural
gas (Scope 1 emissions) and the electricity we use across our estate (Scope 2 emissions). Our Scope 1 and Scope 2
emissions come from fleet, buildings and purchased energy, and we have undertaken numerous activities to reduce
these, including through continuing to rollout gas-powered HGVs, electrifying the Asda Online delivery fleet and
moving to lower-carbon refrigerants. For Scope 3 emissions, we continue to engage with our suppliers to reduce
product-related emissions and work particularly closely with our largest suppliers on setting climate commitments for
the products they sell us. To play our part in tackling climate change, we have been working to decarbonise our Scope
1 and Scope 2 emissions since 2007 and in 2015, set our commitment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by
2025. We have since reduced our greenhouse gas footprint for the United Kingdom by 41% to 564,247 tonnes CO2
equivalent (“tCO2e”) in 2023 (without giving effect to the Arthur Acquisition) compared to our baseline of 957,918
tCO2e in 2015. This reduction has been driven in part by a reduction in electricity and gas use, the continued transition
of our heavy goods vehicles fleet to low or no carbon fuels and implementing lower carbon refrigeration and energy
efficiency measures across our stores.

In addition, in 2021 we stated our ambition to be a net-zero business, establishing a clear roadmap to
achieving net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions within our own operations by 2040. We have
committed to setting a near-term science-based carbon reduction target, including a specific Forests, Land and
Agriculture target. These targets have been submitted to the Science-Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”) for validation.
The proposed targets were submitted before the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition so reflect our footprint
prior to these acquisitions. In 2024, we will look to incorporate these acquisitions into our baseline and targets.

In 2022, our total carbon footprint was 28,295,682 tCO2e (without giving effect to the Arthur Acquisition)
including 51% from product emissions (including the farming of ingredients, processing products, through to
packaging), 2% in connection with supply chain logistics, 2% from our sites and fleet, 4% from goods not for resale
as well as our operational activity, 25% from customers using the fuel we sell them and the remaining 16% from
customers using products (including cooking, washing clothes, disposing of products and packaging).

_Nature_

Food production systems require a diverse range of plants, animals, bacteria and fungi, both for the direct
supply of food and to sustain the underlying ecosystem processes that make agriculture possible – from water supply
to soil fertility enhancement, pollination and natural pest control. We are mindful of the impact we have through our
value chain on the natural capitals of air, water, soil and biodiversity, and are committed to working in partnership to
better respect and restore nature.

In recent years, we have encouraged farmers to keep soil covered and improve biodiversity and soil structure
through the use of our bespoke seed mixture. These seeds create a wildlife habitat during the late spring and summer
and the wildlife corridors can also be used as buffer strips to watercourses.

We are committed to more sustainably sourcing key commodities and tracking performance against our most
material impacts, including soy and palm, within our annual ESG Report. We support the principles of Integrated
Farm Management (“IFM”) and, in early 2023, we committed to obtaining the global LEAF Marque Environmental
Assurance System across all our fresh produce by the end of 2025.

186


-----

_Water Resources_

Water resources are under stress around the world, and we believe improving water use and building
resilience in global supply chains is vital in order to sustainably feed a growing population with healthy and affordable
products.

In 2022, 22% of our fruit and vegetables were imported from Southern Spain. As part of a cross-industry
group working with the British Waste & Resources Action Programme (“WRAP”), we have made a three-year
commitment for funding to the ‘Water Stewardship in South Spain’ project, which is taking action to try to reduce
water-related risks in the fruit and vegetable production areas of Andalusia, Murcia and Valencia.

In addition, we work with many garment manufacturers who have taken a series of water saving measures to
reduce water consumption such as using harvested/reused water for flushing toilets and excess steam pipe water being
returned to the boiler for reuse.

_Waste_

_Food Waste_

We are committed to being a zero-waste business, which means that any waste we do generate is either
reused, recycled or redistributed. We continue to work towards our 2025 waste reduction targets across food (20%
reduction in waste), packaging (100% recyclable own brand packaging, 30% recycled content) and operational waste
(90% diversion from energy and maintain zero to landfill).

As part of our efforts to reduce food surplus, we created a new team dedicated to reducing food waste within
our supply chain in 2019. This team scrutinises our food waste performance by individual product line, enabling us to
create initiatives and to work with our suppliers to reduce food waste. As a result, we removed best before dates on
almost 250 fresh fruit and vegetable products to help customers reduce food waste in the home and save money in
2022 and, in early 2023, we went further by changing the use by dates on over half of our own brand yoghurts to a
best before date, aiming to reduce the volume of edible yoghurt thrown away each year (by all retailers). In 2022, we
processed 32,923 tonnes of food surplus (redistribution/animal feed) and food waste (anaerobic digestion/energy from
waste) from our stores and depots.

Whilst our priority is to reduce the absolute volume of our food surplus being processed as waste, we are also
committed to ensuring that we handle that surplus in the most value-adding way possible by directing as much as
possible for human or animal consumption. To tackle operational food waste, we increased the number of charities
we work with redistributing surplus food from our distribution sites and through our partnerships in 2022, our stores,
depots and home offices donated 2,182 tonnes of food, the equivalent of more than 5.2 million meals.

In addition to our Food Waster prevention efforts, we began working with our clothing factories and George
Home suppliers to help us build a robust strategy and policy around waste, which we plan to report through our future
ESG reports and our website.

_Plastic and Packaging_

Although packaging plays a vital role in protecting goods and keeping food fresh for as long as possible,
consumers increasingly want to see fewer single-use plastics, especially when it comes to fresh produce. Where
packaging is vital, we are working to make it more sustainable. Removing packaging completely or shrinking it down
to its lightest possible weight has allowed us to remove significant amounts of plastic from Asda Brand products and
eliminate some types of single-use plastic products from our stores and offices completely. Where packaging cannot
be reduced, we are working to make it more reusable. We introduced reusable or re-tillable solutions for packaging
that allowed a shift towards fresh meat and produce being transited in reusable crates and introduced customer refills
at our Middleton “sustainability store,” which is a concept designed to encourage customers to reuse and refill their
products, allowing customers to bring and fill their own containers with products such as on core products such as
cereals, tea, coffee and pet food. We have partnered with Unilever and WRAP to conduct research to make the refill
experience easier and more enjoyable for our customers.

187


-----

Where packaging cannot be reused, we are working to make it more recyclable.

_Healthy, Sustainable Choices_

At Asda, we are making nutritious food affordable and appealing, with health-focused communications,
support for public health campaigns and innovation in our own-brand products. We recognise the importance of
front-of-pack traffic lights to enable customers to manage their calorie intake and their intakes of nutrients of concern
such as fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt. In October 2022, location restrictions on the sale of high fat, salt and sugar
foods (“HFSS”) came into force in England across 13 categories, a measure which forms a key part of the UK
Government’s strategy to tackle obesity by making unhealthy food less prominent in stores and online. Despite the
operational challenges affecting the way foods in Asda are merchandised and the significant investment required, we
used the HFSS legislation to accelerate our ability to collect HFSS data across brands for all products, which is
essential to be able to report on healthy basket spend.

We also recognise the importance of highlighting healthy choices to our customers with a focus on positive
nutrients and health benefits, which is the motivation behind our 2020 launch of the Asda Live Better icon, which
highlights the healthiest choices in our own-brand ranges. In the fourth quarter of 2023, approximately 876 products,
including a wide range from the Just Essentials by Asda, bore the icon and we aim to have 1,200 products in the range
by the end of 2024.

_Supporting Local Communities_

_Fundraising and Support_

We aim to build stronger communities and to connect others to make a collective impact on our customers.
Through our network of Community Champions and fundraising initiatives, we take action to make a positive change
to poverty, tackle breast cancer, support children and families in crisis and build more resilient communities.

The Asda Foundation is an independent charity with more than 30 years’ of history helping people in local
communities. Its mission is to transform communities and improve lives throughout the United Kingdom,
complementing Asda’s ambition to be at the heart of local communities. The Asda Foundation supports grassroots
organisations as well as local communities in emergencies, reacting quickly to help people in the immediate hours
following a disaster. The Asda Foundation provides grants to small, local activities, funding a wide range of projects
from school uniforms and Christmas lunches to refurbishing a community centre kitchen.

Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Asda and the Asda Foundation pledged £1.0 million to support
displaced Ukrainian families in Europe and the United Kingdom and helped Ukrainian refugees by welcoming
applications for roles in our stores, warehouses and within IPL, with a guaranteed job interview and specialist support
for those recruited.

The increasing cost of living is a growing issue in the United Kingdom and in 2022, Asda Foundation
introduced a new Cost of Living grant to support local groups with increased running costs. In 2022 Asda Foundation
invested £4,315,444 in local communities, supporting 7,119 groups with grants and colleague hardship payments.

Over 14 million people in the United Kingdom live below the poverty line, and just under a third of those
affected are children. At the same time, 4.4 million tonnes of edible food are wasted in the United Kingdom each year
and as a food retailer, it is important to us to make a positive impact. Through its transformational three-year, Fight
Hunger, Create Change programme, Asda partnered with FareShare and The Trussell Trust to create long-term
positive change in the United Kingdom. Asda has since continued to support both FareShare and the Trussell Trust
through donations of food, cause-related marketing initiatives, customer fundraising and top up donations.

_Diversity & Inclusion_

Our mission is to be the UK’s most trusted retailer, which means building a business that is diverse and
inclusive, creating a safe and supportive environment for our colleagues, customers and suppliers. We focus on
providing the best possible learning opportunities for our colleagues, listening to their needs and promoting their
health and wellbeing and as further support, we launched a course called “Inclusion Matters” in 2022 to help

188


-----

colleagues build an inclusive work environment. We encourage everyone to be allies through positive and conscious
efforts and introduced an “Asda Allies” campaign to raise awareness on how our colleagues can help
under-represented colleagues and its importance. Asda Allies is a key lens for all our internal campaigns and underpins
that one does not have to be directly affected by discrimination or unfair treatment to challenge non-inclusive
behaviour, advocate the need for change, and seek to understand the additional barriers that some people or
communities face.

We have set a target to increase the proportion of female store managers to 30% by 2025 and have established
programmes to deliver this, such as our Retail Female Representation Working Group, which is tasked with looking
at the barriers to increasing female store leadership and our Female Intentional Allyship programme that launched in
2022. In 2023, 290 of our colleagues participated in the Female Intentional Allyship programme.

Over the years, we introduced 75 apprenticeship programmes, including degrees in data science, supply chain
leadership and business management and were recognised in 2022 as one of the United Kingdom’s top 100
apprenticeship employers. In 2023, Asda was a finalist in the Macro Employer of the Year category of the National
Apprenticeship Awards.

_Supply Chain and Responsible Sourcing_

Ethics and compliance are at the heart of ensuring our business meets the expectations of our stakeholders in
terms of conduct and behaviours. These behaviours and expectations extend to everyone who works with us, from our
employees to our suppliers and contractors, requiring them to share our values and help promote a culture where
people do the right thing as a matter of course. We have integrated supply chain policies into our processes and ways
of working to obtain supply chain transparency and continue to work to ensure our supply chains are resilient and lead
to positive change by sourcing responsibly, promoting human rights and eschewing modern slavery. Our Ethics and
Compliance programme is designed to manage compliance risks with key areas relevant to the retail sectors including
anti-corruption, anti-trust, consumer protection, environmental, anti-money laundering and financial services, food
safety, health and safety, optical and pharmacy, labour and employment, licences and permits, privacy, product safety,
responsible sourcing and trade sanctions. Since our separation from Walmart we have been transitioning to establish
an Asda-specific approach to responsible sourcing and in 2022, we published our Human Rights Policy and completed
a responsible sourcing risk assessment based on supplier compliance information to identify salient risks and themes
including gender, modern slavery, vulnerable workers, worker representation and working hours as key topics to
address and further integrate throughout our business.

**Our Technology and Information Systems**

Our information systems are critical to our business operations. They provide management, analytical and
performance evaluation tools that assist management at all levels to undertake business processes. Our technical
infrastructure and computer applications are also used for the day-to-day management of our business, including
purchasing, sourcing, distribution, online sales, data exploitation, invoicing, cash collection, reporting, consolidation
and electronic data interchange. Our business depends on the ability of our colleagues to process transactions on secure
information systems and our capacity to store, retrieve, process and manage information. Our information systems are
highly integrated, covering most of our fundamental business service areas. The majority of our core systems are
currently provided and managed by Walmart, and we are migrating off of these systems onto alternative solutions
through Project Future. As of March 31, 2024, we have invested approximately £600 million in Project Future,
comprising of both operating expenses and capital expenditure. We believe Project Future presents significant
opportunities in terms of our efficiency, data capabilities, customer experience and competitive edge. We are in the
third year of the four-year programme. We are progressing through the build and implement of Project Future, moving
to in-depth testing and roll-out. We have successfully converted seven depots as of March 31, 2024 as part of our new
Warehouse Management system “Manhattan” (with two more in progress) and have implemented our new store till
systems across many stores. Our core back-office SAP system is also live, onto which we have recently transitioned
our finance operations, and we are undertaking detailed testing to prepare for transitioning our commercial function
to SAP in the second quarter of 2024. We have recently implemented our new core human resources and payroll
systems across our entire network. In the second half of 2024, our inventory management and fulfilment systems will
be rolled out across our commercial, supply chain and retail estate. We are targeting complete separation from Walmart
by the end of 2024. We believe that our information systems are robust, adequate to support our activities and operate
at standards that are comparable to other operators in our industry. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our

_Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart.”_

**Our Publicity, Marketing and Customer Service**

Marketing is an integral part of the promotion of our brand, stores and products. We carry out a number of
branding and advertising initiatives through our stores, websites and mobile applications, as well as through print,
social and broadcast advertising campaigns. We work these through owned, earned and paid channels. The key focus
of our messaging to our customers is an emphasis on value, the innovative, high-quality and well-priced products we
offer and brand sentiment, services and ways to shop as well as a focus on corporate social responsibility. We also
have an online and paper magazine, Asda MAG/Good Living, through which we promote our products and brand
values, as well as encourage customer engagement with our brands and offers. We receive publicity for our innovations
in product range and quality across own-brands, which helped us to win over 700 product awards, 378 food awards,
332 beer, wine and spirit awards and five retailer awards in 2023.

Customer service is key to winning and retaining customers. We make customer service available in our
stores, online and by telephone. We offer our George customers a loyalty programme, George Rewards, and in 2022,
we launched our new loyalty programme, Asda Rewards. The scheme is app-based and enables customers to earn
cash back on their shopping, building Asda Pounds in their cash pots to spend in store. The scheme also provides the
opportunity to leverage data insights which enable to Group to better target investment in the customer proposition.
Asda Rewards had 4.9 million active customers as of December 31, 2023 over the prior 30-day period (or 5.7 million
active customers as of December 31, 2023 over the prior 13-week period) and continues to drive incremental sales. It
is central to our strategic objective around proposition and creating more reasons to shop with us than anyone else.

**Our Intellectual Property**

We use a variety of trade names, service marks and trade marks in our business and rely on trade mark and
copyright laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual proprietary rights. Our
key brands are, among others: Asda, George Clothing and George Home.

We believe that the brand names of each of our various banners enjoy high brand recognition and are material
to our business. Our intellectual property policy is centred around the protection of our brands, associated logos and
our domain names. This policy involves filings and reservations on either a local country basis or in the full range of
countries where we operate or wish to preserve and protect our rights.

Certain intellectual property rights related to Asda, including trademarks, are owned solely by Walmart. In
particular, intellectual property rights relating to the George brand are owned by a Walmart group company and used
by both Walmart and Asda. Walmart has granted Asda a licence to use the George brand in the United Kingdom (for
sale, marketing and distribution purposes on an exclusive basis); in certain specified countries in Europe (on a
non-exclusive basis) where it is currently used as part of Asda’s business; and certain other territories outside the
United Kingdom and such specified European countries (on a non-exclusive basis) in substantially the same way as
and to the same extent the brand was used by Asda immediately prior to the date of the Acquisition Agreement, as
specified in, and subject to the terms of, the TMA, in each case on and subject to the terms of the TMA, while Walmart
will continue to own the brand and use it in other territories. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions—Delays_
_in our ability to separate from Walmart could result in significant cost and any issues with the separation process,_
_particularly related to our transition to a new IT system, could significantly disrupt business operations and impact_
_our ability to meet our strategic objectives.”_

**Insurance**

We maintain insurance coverage against the risks inherent in our various businesses. Our insurance policies
cover marine and cargo (including for our ‘toyou’ offer), directors and officers, core and non-core property, terrorism,
cyber, combined liability (employee liability, public liability, products liability) including medical malpractice for our
pharmacy business, motor, machinery movement and private medical insurance.

190


-----

To support the combined liability and motor policies (in particular the self-funding deductible and aggregate
provisions), collateral such as letters of credit and bonds, are provided to our insurers for each policy year. These are
amended from time to time to reflect the existing and anticipated book value in each policy year.

We consider our policies adequate to cover the major risks of our business, and we believe that the level of
insurance which we maintain is comparable, in each case, to that maintained by other companies in our primary
markets operating in the same business area, but there can be no assurance that this coverage will be sufficient to cover
the cost of defence or damages in the event of a significant claim. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and
_Regulatory Matters—We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to significant_
_financial risks if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate.”_

**Lease Agreements**

We have a number of lease agreements in place in connection with the Warehouse Sale and Leaseback
Transaction, the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction. For more detail on
these leases and transactions, see “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Warehouse Asset Leases,”
“Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—2023 Sale and Leaseback Facility” and “Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Ground Rent Transactions – Ground Rent Facility.”_

**Regulation**

We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and industry standards administered by local, national
and other government entities. The following provides a brief description of the main laws and regulations that govern
our activities. References and discussions to directives, laws, regulations and other administrative and regulatory
documents are entirely qualified by the full text of such directives, laws, regulations and other administrative and
regulatory documents themselves.

We are in regular contact and dialogue with relevant regulators and have subject matter experts across the
business who monitor and manage compliance with the regulatory frameworks within which we operate.

**_Controlled Land Order_**

We are subject to the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 (the “Controlled Land
**Order”) which is UK legislation designed to limit the ability of large grocery retailers to prevent land being used by**
their competitors for grocery retailing in the future. The Controlled Land Order is administered by the CMA (as
defined below).

**_Groceries Supply Code of Practice and Groceries Code Adjudicator_**

We are subject to the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (the “GSCOP”), which is UK legislation designed
to regulate the relationship between designated retailers and their grocery suppliers. GSCOP provides detail on how
retailers should manage their relevant supplier relationships fairly.

The Groceries Code Adjudicator is the independent regulator of GSCOP.

**_Food Safety, Hygiene, Labelling and Nutrition and Consumer Protection_**

We have food safety specialists in our compliance and technical and quality teams, to ensure food supply,
handling and storage procedures are monitored closely to ensure product safety, quality standards and compliance
with all applicable food safety and hygiene laws and regulations. In doing so this ensures all aspects of food safety
risk are managed appropriately across supply, operations and foodservice. Scheduled internal and external audits are
conducted by qualified, third-party food safety experts to ensure procedural compliance and adherence with our
policies. This verification programme identifies and evaluates the hazards that are significant for food safety and
hygiene, taking account of the Food Safety Act 1990, the Food Information Regulations 2014 (as amended) and Food
Safety and Hygiene Regulations in place across England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. In addition, the Food
Information (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2022 and the Food Information (Scotland) Amendment Regulations
2021, also known as “Natasha’s Law,” took effect in October 2021 and requires businesses to list all the ingredients
on individual packaging of products that are considered pre-packed for direct sale.

**_Regulation Relating to our Health and Wellness Offers (Asda Pharmacy and Asda Optical)_**

With respect to our Optical offer, we are regulated by the General Optical Council (“GOC”). Asda Stores
Limited is a registered Body Corporate with the GOC, which allows us to provide Optical services subject to the GOC
Business Standards and the Opticians Act of 1989. Our professionals are registered as individual registrants with the
GOC and are subject to GOC Standards for Individuals and the Opticians Act of 1989.

We hold NHS mandatory contracts for all of our Asda Opticians locations and are subject to the terms of
these contracts. In some of our English Asda Opticians locations, we also hold enhanced services contracts and are
subject to the NHS standard contracts and local service level agreements. Enhanced services are defined as primary
medical services other than essential services, additional services or out-of-hours services.

With respect to our pharmacies, we are regulated by the General Pharmaceutical Council (“GPHC”) in
England and Wales and Scotland, and the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland (“PharmaSNI”). Each of our
individual pharmacies is registered with the GPHC or the PharmaSNI, as applicable. This allows us to carry out
pharmaceutical activity from our registered premises subject to the Standards for Registered Pharmacies. Our
pharmacists are registered with the GPHC as individual registrants and are subject to the GPHC Professional Standards
or the PharmaSNI Professional Standards, as applicable.

**_Regulation Relating to our Money and Insurance Offers_**

_Financial Conduct Authority-authorised Entities_

Asda Stores Limited has been authorised by the FCA since 2017 and currently holds a limited permission to
carry on credit brokerage activities (limited to secondary broking). As a result of this authorisation, Asda Stores
Limited is regulated and supervised by the FCA.

_Appointed Representatives_

The Group includes two introducer-appointed representatives: Asda Stores Limited and Asda Financial
Services Limited.

In addition to the FCA authorisation noted above, Asda Stores Limited is also payment services directive
agent and introducer-appointed representative that is currently involved in insurance and payments intermediation.

Asda Financial Services Limited is an introducer-appointed representative which is currently involved in
credit and insurance intermediation.

In respect of these roles, Asda Stores Limited and Asda Financial Service Limited are not directly authorised
by the FCA but may instead perform certain regulated activities and act as agent for firms that are directly authorised
by the FCA.

**_Regulations Relating to Our Mobile Offer_**

_OFCOM Regulations_

Asda is selling mobile communication services to consumers under the Asda Mobile brand using Vodafone’s
network pursuant to a mobile virtual operator agreement with Vodafone. See also “Our Businesses—Our Other
_Services—Asda Mobile.” The sale and supply of mobile communication services are regulated primarily by the Office_
of Communications (“OFCOM”), an independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications
industries, within the framework set by the various European directives, the UK Communications Act 2003 and other
UK and European Union regulations and recommendations. Asda does not require a licence to operate the mobile
communication services, however, it must comply with the provisions of OFCOM’s General Conditions of
Entitlement that apply to such services.

192


-----

**_Regulations Relating to Electricity Purchasing_**

Up until March 2021, we purchased our electricity on a wholesale basis via a dedicated subsidiary, which
sold electricity back to the rest of the Asda Group companies. These electricity purchases were regulated by the Office
of Gas and Electricity Markets (“OFGEM”), which is the government regulator for gas and electricity markets in
Great Britain.

Since March 2021, we have purchased our electricity on a retail basis facilitated through a third-party agent
and therefore the regulations relating to wholesale purchases do not apply to the retail purchases made thereafter.

Following the switch from purchasing wholesale electricity (via the Power4All subsidiary) in March 2021,
we withdrew from all the various utility regulatory bodies including the BSC, via Elexon. All industry parties were
written to by OFGEM as part of the process to ensure we had no outstanding obligations. Once these confirmations
were received, the licence was revoked in July 23. As a result, we are no longer a wholesale contracting party and we
have no on-going responsibilities to report, or any liabilities with any industry party including HMRC, BEIS or
National Grid in relation to Power4All.

**_Data Privacy Regulations_**

Through our in-store and online business, as well as certain of our other services (such as our money and
pharmacy offers), we have access to and may process personal data relating to our customers and colleagues or any
other individual in connection with the provision of our services (the “Relevant Data”). As such, we are subject to
applicable laws and binding regulations on data protection and data privacy, including the UK GDPR (such laws and
binding regulations together with the UK GDPR, “Applicable Privacy Laws”). We will continue to review and
develop existing processes to ensure that we comply with Applicable Privacy Laws in relation to our processing of
any Relevant Data.

**_Competition and Markets Authority_**

From time to time, we may enter into acquisitions or transactions that are subject to regulatory approval from
the Competition and Markets Authority (the “CMA”) and may lead to investigations if the deal raises competition
concerns. The CMA is the principal competition regulator in the United Kingdom and is a non-ministerial government
department. It is responsible to strengthening business competition and preventing and reducing anti-competitive
activities.

_Green Claims Code_

In 2021, the CMA introduced the Green Claims Code, which is designed for businesses with consumer-facing
products and services to ensure that their environmental claims align with UK consumer law. The Green Claims Code
applies to advertising and any product or service, by any commercial entity, aimed at or supplied to a UK consumer,
including by a non-UK business, a distributor or an online platform.

**_Miscellaneous Regulatory Matters_**

In addition to the foregoing regulations, in the ordinary course of our business, our operations and properties
are subject to international, national, regional and local laws and regulations of general applicability, such as labour
laws, laws on advertising, regulations governing our relations with our suppliers and distributors, anti-bribery, food
and product safety, environmental, health and safety matters (including regulations specific to the fuel market, such
as for petroleum storage certificates, the management and disposal of hazardous materials, air emissions and water
discharge and the clean-up of contaminated sites), among others.

We operate a vehicle fleet that is subject to an Operator’s Licence issued by the relevant local Traffic
Commissioner, the conditions of which are enforced through the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency in England
and Wales and Scotland, and through the Driver and Vehicle Agency (NI) in Northern Ireland. We are also subject to
road transport legislation and regulations that determine, among other issues, the maximum weight that large goods
vehicles and light vans can carry, and the maximum number of hours a driver can work or drive over defined periods.
See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters.”

193


-----

**Legal Proceedings**

At any given time, we may be party to litigation or be subject to non-litigated claims arising out of the normal
operations of our business, including but not limited to colleague claims, disputes with our suppliers and customers
and disputes with our lessors and landlords as part of our real estate management operations. A description of material
legal proceedings and investigations to which we are party is below. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal
_and Regulatory Matters—From time to time we and/or our management are subject to claims that can result in_
_litigation, arbitration, tax or regulatory proceedings which could distract management from our business activities_
_and result in significant liability.”_

**_Equal Value Litigation_**

Asda Stores Limited is a defendant in approximately 52,923 equal value claims (the “Equal Value Claims”)
that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the “Employment Tribunal”)
in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store colleagues, and further claims may be asserted in
the future. There are also 8,147 claims filed in the High Court which are stayed pending the outcome of the Equal
Value Claims. The claimants allege that the work performed by colleagues in Asda’s retail stores is of equal value in
terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of colleagues working in Asda’s warehouse
and distribution facilities, that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because
more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay
difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates
in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.

In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could
compare their positions in Asda’s retail stores with those of colleagues in Asda’s warehouse and distribution facilities.
On March 26, 2021, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, that the work of hourly-paid workers
in distribution centres and the work of hourly-paid workers in stores can be compared.

The litigation is currently in the equal value stage when the Employment Tribunal Claimants are proceeding
in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal
value to the work performed by colleagues in Asda’s warehouse and distribution facilities. The equal value hearing is
scheduled to take place from September 9, 2024 to December 13, 2024 at the Manchester Employment Tribunal. At
present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or
range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance as to the scope and
outcomes of these matters and any losses that may arise from these proceedings could have a material adverse effect
on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe we have substantial factual and
legal defences to these claims and intend to defend the claims vigorously.

Under a separate indemnity undertaking, Walmart has agreed to indemnify the LBO Purchaser in respect of
a portion of costs and losses incurred by the Asda Group from Equal Value Claims filed with employment tribunals,
up to an agreed cap. If the Asda Group is ultimately unsuccessful in defending any of the Equal Value Claims, we do
not believe that such an outcome would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of
operations nor our ability to meet our debt service obligations, including on the Senior Secured Notes, or other
financial obligations as they become due.

As of December 31, 2023, the Group had material off balance sheet arrangements or funding arrangements
that would be classified as a contingent liability under UK IFRS with respect to the ongoing Equal Value Claims.
Despite the above-mentioned Supreme Court ruling, the Group has not recognised a provision on the basis that any
loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings cannot be reasonably estimated and any potential liability
is only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead
to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. See “Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal Value
_Litigation” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters—From time to time we and/or our_
_management are subject to claims that can result in litigation, arbitration, tax or regulatory proceedings which could_
_distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability.”_

**_Environmental Claims Matter_**

On July 29, 2022, the CMA publicly announced that they would be investigating environmental claims made
in relation to certain products within our George clothing range, and ranges of two other clothing retailers with
operations in the United Kingdom. Initial findings relevant to Asda were presented to us on a confidential basis in
May 2023. In presenting its findings, the CMA required all information to be specific and visible to customers at the
time of their purchasing decision. We opted to negotiate a set of voluntary undertakings (with no admission of liability)
with respect to the way environmental claims are made going forward, rather than face court-based enforcement
(which could include costs, negative publicity and exposure to significant fines for breach of consumer protection
laws (up to 10% global annual turnover under incoming legislation)). These undertakings were concluded and
announced in March 2024, simultaneously with the other two investigated retailers.

**Management Incentive Plan**

In 2022, management shares in the immediate parent company of the Group, Bellis Midco 4 Limited, were
issued to eligible members of senior management employed by the Group as part of a Management Incentive Plan
(“MIP”), in exchange for proceeds determined by an independent calculation of fair value at the issue date. Under the
MIP, an intermediate holding company of the Group, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, has entered into an agreement with the
holders of MIP management shares (“MIP scheme members”) whereby MIP scheme members are granted put
options which, when exercised, enable them to sell their management shares to Bellis Midco 2 Limited or another
non-Group entity for a value which is based on an independent valuation determined at the exercise date.

MIP scheme members are required to be employed by the Group at the grant date of the MIP shares. If a
member of the scheme ceases to be employed by the Group during the vesting period, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, a parent
of Bellis Finco PLC, has the option to repurchase, or nominate another entity of the Group to repurchase, the shares
during the 12-month period after the member’s leave date. As such, directors of the Group have determined that the
MIP scheme falls within the scope of IFRS 2. The difference between the IFRS 2 fair value and the fair value paid by
MIP scheme members at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period (i.e., the period from date on which the
MIP shares are granted to the estimated exercise date) as an expense in the consolidated Income Statement. As neither
MIP shares nor put options over MIP shares are issued by entities within the Group, and as there is no recharge
agreement in place which requires any entity within the Group to settle liabilities in respect of MIP shares, changes in
the fair value of MIP shares are accounted for on an equity-settled basis.

**Bellis TopCo Limited Shareholders’ Agreement**

On February 12, 2021, Able Holdings Limited (a company owned by Zuber Vali Issa CBE and Mohsin Issa
CBE), Optima Group S.à r.l., Bellis TopCo Limited and Property Newco entered into a shareholders’ agreement (the
“Shareholders’ Agreement”), which governed various rights of the shareholders of Bellis TopCo Limited and
Property Newco in relation to their direct shareholding in Bellis TopCo Limited and Property Newco and indirect
shareholding in the Group.

On December 31, 2021, Able Holdings Limited, Optima Group S.à r.l., Bellis TopCo Limited and Property
Newco entered into a Deed of Amendment relating to the Shareholders’ Agreement (as amended, the “Amended and
**Restated Shareholders’ Agreement”), to reflect the fact that Property Newco had become a wholly-owned**
subsidiary of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited. The Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement, to which Property
Newco is not a party, governs the various rights of the shareholders of Bellis TopCo Limited in relation to their direct
shareholding in Bellis TopCo Limited and indirect shareholding in the Group.

Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement, Able Holdings Limited (the “Individual
**Investors Shareholder”), on the one hand, and Optima Group S.à r.l. (the “TDR Shareholder”), on the other hand,**
is entitled to appoint or remove directors in certain circumstances. The Individual Investors Shareholder and the TDR
Shareholder is each entitled to appoint and remove (i) two members of the board of directors of Bellis TopCo Limited
so long as such shareholder, together with its affiliates, hold 35% or more of the share capital of Bellis TopCo Limited,
or (ii) one member of the board of directors of Bellis TopCo Limited so long as such shareholders, together with its
affiliates, hold between 15% and 35% of the share capital of Bellis TopCo Limited. The maximum number of directors
for the board of Bellis TopCo Limited will be five and, subject to certain actions which required the consent of the
Individual Investors Shareholder and the TDR Shareholder, as summarised below, all decisions of the board of
directors may be made by a majority of the votes cast.

The Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement provides that certain actions in relation to the Group
may not be taken without the consent of both the Individual Investors Shareholder (or any of the directors appointed
by it) and the TDR Shareholder (or any of the directors appointed by it). These include amendments to the
organisational documents of any member of the Group, variations to the rights attaching to the shares in any member
of the Group, the declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution by any Group company (other than to Bellis
TopCo Limited or another Group company which is wholly-owned by Bellis TopCo Limited), a material change in
the nature or scope of the Group’s business and the winding-up or dissolution of Bellis TopCo Limited, any of its
subsidiaries or any other Group company.

The Shareholders’ Agreement contains certain restrictions on the transfer by the Individual Investors
Shareholder or the TDR Shareholder of its shares in Bellis TopCo Limited or any other member of the Group,
including (other than transfers to certain permitted transferees, including affiliates) an obligation to first offer any
shares to the other shareholder before offering them for sale to a third party.

At any time on or after the third anniversary of the LBO Acquisition Completion Date and prior to the fifth
anniversary of LBO Acquisition Completion Date, either the Individual Investors Shareholder or the TDR Shareholder
may propose an exit event involving the Bellis Group and the Group, including the sale of shares in Bellis TopCo
Limited; the sale by Bellis TopCo Limited or any other member of the Group of all or substantially all of the Group’s
business, assets and undertaking; any public offering in respect of any shares in Bellis TopCo Limited or any other

202


-----

Group company which owns substantially all of the assets of the Group at the time; and the winding up of Bellis
TopCo Limited, in each case on specified terms and subject to the occurrence of certain conditions (an “Exit”). The
recipient of such proposal regarding an Exit shall consider such proposal in good faith, but shall not be obliged to
accept such proposal.

At any time on or following the fifth anniversary of the LBO Acquisition Completion Date either the
Individual Investors Shareholder or the TDR Shareholder may propose an Exit involving the Bellis Group and the
Group. The recipient of such proposal shall be required to accept such proposal provided that certain conditions are
satisfied.

**Walmart Senior Shares and Special Participation Share**

On the LBO Acquisition Completion Date, Bellis TopCo 2 Limited, Bellis TopCo Limited and Global
Pinnacle Corporation (among others) entered into a shareholders’ agreement (the “Topco 2 Shareholders’
**Agreement”), which governs various rights of the shareholders of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited in relation to their direct**
shareholding in Bellis TopCo 2 Limited and indirect shareholding in the Group. On June 16, 2021, Global Pinnacle
Corporation transferred its shares in Bellis TopCo 2 Limited to Bellis Holding LLC (“BHL”) and BHL adhered to the
TopCo 2 Shareholders’ Agreement. The terms of the Topco 2 Shareholders’ Agreement provide for BHL to hold two
classes of shares: (i) the Senior Shares; and (ii) the Special Participation Share. Unless otherwise agreed between the
shareholders of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited (or where such transfer is made to a permitted transferee in accordance with
the terms of the TopCo 2 Shareholders’ Agreement or with the consent of the shareholders), neither the Special
Participation Share nor any of the Senior Shares may be transferred to any person unless there is a simultaneous
transfer of all of the Senior Shares and the Special Participation Share to the same transferee.

Pursuant to the TopCo 2 Shareholders’ Agreement, BHL, as holder of the Senior Shares, is entitled to appoint
or remove one director to or from the board of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited (the “Senior Shareholder Director”). The holder
of the Senior Shares will have no voting rights as shareholders of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited, other than in relation to certain
matters that would materially adversely affect the rights of the holder of the Senior Shares.

The holders of the Senior Shares have the right to receive an annual fixed cumulative senior dividend. Such
dividend is payable on the principal amount of the Senior Shares plus accrued but unpaid dividends. Bellis TopCo 2
Limited may elect to pay such dividend in cash or for such dividend to accrue unpaid.

The Senior Shares will be mandatorily redeemed by Bellis TopCo 2 Limited upon the occurrence of certain
events, including upon an exit event involving Bellis TopCo 2 Limited. Such exit events include: the sale of the
ordinary shares in Bellis TopCo 2 Limited; the sale by Bellis TopCo 2 Limited or any other member of the Group of
all or substantially all of the Group’s business, assets and undertaking; any public offering in respect of all or
substantially all of the ordinary shares in Bellis TopCo 2 Limited, of all or substantially all shares in any other Group
company representing all or substantially all of the Group’s business, assets and undertaking or of all or substantially
all of the shares of any company which is a direct or indirect holder of all or substantially all ordinary shares in Bellis
TopCo 2 Limited; or a change of control of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited. The Senior Shares will further be mandatorily
redeemed by Bellis TopCo 2 Limited on the seventh anniversary of the issuance of the Senior Shares, being February
16, 2028. The expected repayment amount that would be required to be made in cash to Walmart by Bellis TopCo 2
on February 16, 2028, including any accrued and unpaid interest, is approximately £900 million. Bellis TopCo 2
Limited may voluntarily redeem the Senior Shares at any time subject to paying a make-whole amount.

Pursuant to the Topco 2 Shareholders’ Agreement, BHL, in its capacity as holder of the Special Participation
Share, has no right to appoint or remove directors to the board of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited, but will have the right to
appoint a board observer if no Senior Shareholder Director has been appointed. The holder of the Special Participation
Share, in its capacity as holder of the Special Participation Share, has no voting rights as a shareholder of Bellis TopCo
2 Limited, other than in relation to matters that would materially adversely affect the rights of the holder of the Special
Participation Share.

The holder of the Special Participation Share has the right to participate in 10% of any dividends paid by
Bellis TopCo 2 Limited to the ordinary shareholders and any exit proceeds payable to the ordinary shareholders. On
the occurrence of a public offering in respect of any shares in Bellis TopCo 2 Limited, the holder of the Special
Participation Share will have the right to redeem the Special Participation Share at a price equal to 10% of the listing

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

The Group enters into transactions with certain related parties or the Group’s affiliates from time to time and
in the ordinary course of the Group’s business.

**Transactions** **Related to the EG UK Acquisition**

On May 30, 2023, EG Group (contracting by EG Finco Limited) (“EG”) announced its binding agreement
to sell a substantial majority of its fuel, foodservice and grocery and merchandise business in the United Kingdom to
Asda, by way of a corporate sale and subject to various adjustments and agreement upon a precise transaction
perimeter. Following discussions between Asda and EG on the perimeter of the EG UK Acquisition and discussions
with relevant brand partners, EG and Asda agreed that EG’s franchise businesses carried on under the Starbucks brand
and the KFC brand in the United Kingdom and Ireland (the “Starbucks Business” and the “KFC Business,”
respectively), together with their employees, would not transfer to Asda as part of the EG UK Acquisition. As a result
of these discussions, the EG UK Acquisition was completed on October 31, 2023 for total cash consideration of £2.1
billion.

On the EG UK Completion Date, EG Group (using EG Corporate Services Limited) entered into a transitional
services agreement with Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited (together with its subsidiaries, the “Acquired EG UK Target
**Group”), pursuant to which EG agreed to continue to provide access to or cover the costs of all centralised shared**
services (such as IT, HR, accounting, payroll, compliance and tax functions), that were, in the 12 months prior to
completion of the EG UK Acquisition, provided to the Acquired EG UK Target Group by EG, for a transitional period
(the “EG TSA”). The initial term of the EG TSA is for a period of up to two years from the EG UK Completion Date,
subject to certain rights for the Acquired EG UK Target Group to terminate, or transition away from, services early
or to extend the initial term for an aggregate period of up to a further 12 months (in 3 months increments). During the
term of the EG TSA, EG will also provide certain of the IT services that will continue to be provided to the Acquired
EG UK Target Group to Asda, for the benefit of certain other convenience retail sites that Asda and its affiliates own
from time to time, including those branded as “Asda Express.” The services provided by EG to the Acquired EG UK
Target Group will be deemed to be subject to a service credit for the first two years of the EG TSA, as a result of
which the Acquired EG UK Target Group will not be required to make any payment to EG for the services (subject
to certain limited exceptions) and thereafter will be provided for a fee based on the actual cost to EG of providing the
services, plus an agreed margin that will be applied to any non-third party costs. The services provided to Asda in
respect of convenience retail sites that are not part of the Acquired EG UK Target Group will be provided for a fee
payable to EG based on the actual cost to EG of providing the services, plus an agreed margin that will be applied to
non-third party costs. EG’s liability for provision of the services will be subject to limitations customary for an
agreement of this nature, including an annual financial cap on EG’s liability of £12.2 million for most liabilities. In
connection with such transitional arrangements, and as further consideration for the EG UK Acquisition, EG also
agreed to cover certain other centralised costs, including redundancy costs, and integration costs during the transitional
period. The EG Seller has provided certain guarantees in favour of entities transferred to Asda as part of the EG UK
Acquisition, or to the Purchaser, in respect of the obligations of EG under: (i) the EG TSA; and (ii) certain business
sale agreements entered into by certain transferred entities and members of EG in connection with reorganisations
effected prior to completion of the EG UK Acquisition.

On the EG UK Completion Date, the EG Seller and Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited also entered into a
transitional brand licence agreement which took effect immediately following the EG UK Completion Date (the “EG
Brand Licence Agreement”). Pursuant to the EG Brand Licence Agreement, EG granted the Acquired EG UK Target
Group a non-exclusive right to use certain of EG’s brands, including the ‘EG’ and ‘Euro Garages’ brands, for a period
of three years, royalty free, to allow the Acquired EG UK Target Group to rebrand its sites and businesses (subject to
earlier termination rights). Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited will have a right to extend the term of the brand licence for
a further two years, in increments of 12 months at a time, if it has not completed this debranding process by the end
of the expiry of the initial three-year term, subject to the parties agreeing a royalty fee for the use of such brands during
such extension.

On May 30, 2023, the EG Seller, the America Purchaser and Asda Stores Limited entered into a side letter
in connection with the electric vehicle charger business, which is part of EG’s retained UK&I business (the “EVPoint
**Side Letter”). Under the EVPoint Side Letter, the EG Seller, the America Purchaser and Asda have documented their**
intention that EV Point Services Limited (a subsidiary of EG) or an affiliate will be appointed as sole provider, operator

205


-----

and installer of electric vehicle charging points at Asda sites (including the sites held by the Acquired EG UK Target
Group) and have agreed to use reasonable endeavours to agree the terms and conditions of such appointment including
the terms of a framework agreement under which that appointment will be documented following completion of the
EG UK Acquisition. The EVPoint Side Letter will (in addition to certain earlier termination rights and events)
terminate if the framework agreement has not been entered into by the date falling 24 months from completion of the
EG UK Acquisition. Commercial discussions remain ongoing.

The EG Seller and the America Purchaser are in discussions regarding the terms on which EG will, in respect
of its retained UK&I business, occupy sites that are owned by the Group, or the Group will occupy sites that are owned
by EG, including sites where the operations of EG’s retained UK&I business and the Acquired EG UK Target Group
are co-located. This will include rights of occupation in respect of sites on which electric vehicle charging points,
including ‘evpoint’-branded chargers, have, prior to completion of the EG UK Acquisition, been installed by EG and
certain lease arrangements relating to the Starbucks Business and the KFC Business.

**Transitional Agreements with Walmart**

On February 16, 2021, in connection with the LBO Acquisition, Walmart (and its affiliates) and the LBO
Seller entered into several transitional agreements with Asda Group, Asda Stores Limited and the LBO Purchaser.
Those agreements included, amongst others, a trade mark agreement (the “TMA”) and a transitional services
agreement (the “TSA”) entered into between Asda Stores Limited and Walmart. The LBO Seller, the LBO Purchaser
and Walmart (among others) further entered into a transitional pensions deed (the “TPD”). The TMA, the TSA and
the TPD are referred to collectively in this Offering Memorandum as the “Transitional Agreements.”

**_Trade Mark Agreement_**

Under the terms of the TMA, Walmart, as licensor, granted Asda Stores Limited a licence to continue to use
certain of Walmart’s trade marks, domain names and brand-related intellectual property. The scope of the TMA
includes licences of the George, Scan & Go, Smart Price and Rollback trade marks, certain domain names, including
George.com, as well as certain other Walmart-owned trade mark rights used by a member of the Asda Group between
October 2019 and the LBO Acquisition Completion Date (the “Licensed IP”). The TMA permits Asda Stores Limited
to sub-license the use of the Licensed IP to specified permitted sub-licensees, including members of the Asda Group,
existing franchisees to which Asda Stores Limited has granted a licence of the Licensed IP under franchise agreements
in place as at the date of the LBO Acquisition Agreement and certain specified companies that are also owned by the
shareholders or funds managed by TDR Capital LLP, provided Walmart is given written notice and the sub-licence
fulfils certain conditions, including that it is on terms that are no less onerous than the TMA. Additionally, Walmart
cannot unreasonably withhold, delay or condition consent for Asda Stores Limited to sub-license the Licensed IP to
certain other entities including those that are controlled by the shareholders of Asda Stores Limited’s ultimate holding
company, provided that the sub-licence fulfils certain conditions, including that it is on terms no less onerous that the
TMA.

Manufacturing or packaging of goods bearing the Licensed IP may take place worldwide. The scope of the
licence for sale, marketing and distribution purposes is the United Kingdom only (on an exclusive basis) and, for the
George brand only, also specified countries in Europe as set out in the TMA (on a non-exclusive basis). These licences
are perpetual and irrevocable, subject to the termination rights summarised below. The TMA includes a non-exclusive
licence to use the George brand in substantially the same way as the brand was used immediately prior to the date of
the LBO Acquisition Agreement in certain territories outside the United Kingdom and the specified European
countries in which Asda Stores Limited has been selling George-branded goods under a specified third-party
e-commerce fulfilment contract immediately prior to the date of the LBO Acquisition Agreement (the “George RoW
**Licence”). All use of the Licensed IP (other than use of the George mark in the United Kingdom) is to be in the same**
manner and style of usage as used between October 2019 and the LBO Acquisition Completion Date, except in respect
of the George RoW Licence and licence of the Walmart spark logo, which must be used in the same way as such
branding was used immediately prior to the date of the LBO Acquisition Agreement and the LBO Acquisition
Completion Date respectively.

In addition, the TMA includes an exclusive, royalty-free licence from Asda Stores Limited to Walmart of the
Extra Special brand (that is owned by Asda) to enable Walmart to continue selling, marketing and distributing products
sold by Walmart under such brand on a perpetual and irrevocable basis in specified countries in Central America and

206


-----

in Mexico. The licence to Walmart of the Asda Stores Limited brand referred to above is subject to similar
sub-licensing and termination provisions as the licence to Asda Stores Limited of Licensed IP.

Asda Stores Limited is not required to pay any royalties in respect of the above licence of the George brand
(other than George RoW Licence), the licences of the Scan & Go, Rollback and Smart Price brands or the transitional
licence of the Walmart spark logo and “Save Money Live Better” (other than a nominal £1 royalty fee). The George
RoW Licence is royalty-free for up to 12 months and thereafter subject to an annual royalty of 2% of the Net Sales
Revenue in the relevant territory. In respect of all other Licensed IP, Asda Stores Limited is required to pay an annual
royalty equal to 3.5% of the net sales revenue received by Asda Stores Limited and any sub-licensees in connection
with the use of such Licensed IP.

The TMA includes restrictions and quality control covenants from Asda Stores Limited including ensuring
that the products sold by Asda Stores Limited under the Licensed IP maintain certain standards, complying with brand
guidelines in relation to visual style and formatting and limiting Asda Stores Limited’s use of the Licensed IP and its
ability to register the Licensed IP. These covenants include not committing or knowingly omitting acts which would
bring the Licensed IP into disrepute or damage, or weaken or be detrimental to the Licensed IP in any material respect.
Asda Stores Limited is also prevented from maintaining an online or e-commerce presence of any of the businesses
(excluding the George business in the United Kingdom) in respect of which the Licensed IP is permitted to be used
except in substantially the same manner and to substantially the same extent as the presence those businesses had in
the period between October 2019 and the LBO Acquisition Completion Date (or in respect of the George RoW
Licence, immediately prior to the date of the LBO Acquisition Agreement). Asda Stores Limited is also expected to
indemnify the Walmart Group against any losses resulting from use of the Licensed IP in material breach of the TMA
and losses related to actual or alleged defect in products or services using the Licensed IP (other than the Scan & Go
or Rollback branding), recalls of defective products and actual or alleged mislabelling or food safety issues related to
the Licensed IP (other than the Scan & Go or Rollback brands). There is no cap on Asda Stores Limited’s liability
under these indemnities or limit on the heads of loss recoverable. The TMA includes warranties on the corporate
existence and capacity of the parties to enter into the TMA but no other warranties or representations (and any implied
warranties, terms or conditions implied by statute or common law are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law).

The term of the TMA is perpetual (other than: (i) the George RoW Licence, which Walmart may terminate
on a per country or per goods/services basis where Walmart itself intends to use or authorise the use of the relevant
Licensed IP in that country (or if required by law), and (ii) in respect of the transitional licences described above).
Either party is able to terminate the licences granted to Asda Stores Limited under the TMA on a per-licence basis
following the insolvency of its counterparty or a material breach or repeated non-material breaches of the terms of the
TMA (in respect of the relevant licence and/or the relevant Licensed IP) (subject to a notice requirement and a 30-day
cure period, to the extent applicable). Walmart also has the right to terminate the licences granted to Asda Stores
Limited under the TMA on a per-licence basis if Asda Stores Limited challenges the validity of the relevant Licensed
IP or following certain change of control events, or with respect to specific trade marks or specific categories or
sub-categories of goods or services on 30 days’ notice if the relevant Licensed IP is not put to material use for a period
of two years. Asda Stores Limited, but not Walmart, is permitted to terminate the licences granted to Asda Stores
Limited under the TMA at any time without cause subject to a three-month notice period. The licence to Walmart of
Asda-owned brands is separately terminable, under similar terms.

**_Transitional Services Agreement_**

Under the TSA, Walmart provides certain information technology services to Asda Stores Limited on a
transitional basis with effect from the LBO Acquisition Completion Date. The services comprise all information
technology and telecommunications services (and related operational system processes) that Walmart Group
Companies provided to the Asda Group in the 12 months prior to the LBO Acquisition Completion Date, and each
such service is to be supplied by Walmart until the earlier of (i) migration of the relevant service as part of the
separation of Asda Stores Limited from Walmart; and (ii) termination of the TSA in accordance with its terms by one
of the parties (as summarised below). The services are arranged into six categories (referred to as “service towers,”
which relate to stores, supply chain, merchandising, back office, e-commerce and infrastructure/security) for charging
and migration purposes.

Asda Stores Limited has the right to terminate any service tower, or the TSA in its entirety, on three months’
notice. In addition, either party has the right to terminate the TSA following the insolvency of its counterparty or a

207


-----

material breach of the terms of the TSA (subject to a notice requirement and a 30-day cure period, to the extent
applicable).

In addition, Asda Stores Limited has the right to request a “Change Freeze” which it did in respect of five of
the six service towers from May 1, 2021, and in respect of the sixth tower (e-commerce) from 2023. This means that
Asda ceases to benefit from changes and a change request service that it would otherwise receive on Walmart’s group
operating model (this is not defined but really is benchmarked by the service Asda has received to date). From the
freeze, Walmart has absolute discretion to reject any “Change Requests” made by Asda in relation to a “frozen” service
tower unless that change relates to a “Mandatory Change” (i.e., a change in relevant Regulations or a change required
for compliance or security reasons) or a usage change.

The TSA includes customary warranties concerning the corporate existence and capacity of the parties and
an undertaking to provide information and participate in discussions in connection with the delivery of the services.
Walmart agrees to provide each service to a standard and in a manner that is consistent with Walmart’s provision of
the equivalent service in the 12 months prior to the LBO Acquisition Completion Date. Walmart is not required to
provide the services to, or to meet, any more onerous standard or service level.

Walmart is required to use reasonable endeavours to obtain and maintain third-party consents that are
required for the provision of the services. Where a third-party consent is not obtained or maintained, Walmart is not
required to provide the relevant service (and the TSA will terminate in respect of the relevant service without liability
on the part of Walmart) and the parties will work together to agree a workaround (including replacement, in-sourcing
or early migration) in order to enable Asda Stores Limited to continue to receive the benefit of the affected service.
All reasonable one-off or ongoing costs of obtaining and maintaining third-party consents or implementing
workarounds are to be borne by Asda Stores Limited, subject to Walmart consulting with Asda Stores Limited before
incurring these costs.

Asda Stores Limited and Walmart have a separation plan in place and the separation costs (excluding internal
costs of the Walmart Group) are borne by Asda Stores Limited.

The charges for the TSA services for the first year following the LBO Acquisition Completion Date were
initially capped at £142 million (excluding any VAT), and the cap on service charges subsequently rises by 1% per
year thereafter. The charges payable for services in subsequent years are equal to the charges for such services for the
previous contract year (subject to any reduction as summarised below) subject to an inflationary increase of 2% per
year. The charges per service tower are split on a fixed cost and variable cost basis. The variable proportion of the
charges reduce to the extent that Asda Stores Limited is able to achieve certain agreed milestones in its separation
plan and ramp down usage of the relevant service tower. The initial terms of the TSA stated that for any service to be
provided beyond a long stop date of three years from the LBO Acquisition Completion Date, being February 2024,
the charges for any remaining services will ratchet up by 10% every six months (the “TSA Ratchet”). However, we
have received a deferral of the TSA Ratchet until February 16, 2025. If we have not substantially completed Project
Future by February 16, 2025, Walmart may be entitled to back-charge us any TSA Ratchet payments that would have
been due under the original terms of the TSA after February 2024. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
_Acquisitions—Delays in our ability to separate from Walmart could result in significant cost and any issues with the_
_separation process, particularly system cutovers, could significantly disrupt business operations and impact our_
_ability to meet our strategic objectives.”_

The liability of the parties under the TSA is limited, where service-specific, to the amount of fees paid or
payable in respect of the relevant service tower during the relevant contract year. In the case of liabilities that are not
related to a specific service tower, the liability of the parties under the TSA is limited to the total amount of fees paid
or payable during the relevant contract year. Each party’s aggregate liability for each contract year is limited to the
amount of fees paid or payable during the relevant contract year. These limitations are subject to limited exceptions,
including in the case of fraud. Neither party is liable for any indirect or consequential losses or loss of profit or loss
of revenue and, to the extent Walmart’s breach is caused by a third-party default, Walmart’s maximum liability to
Asda Stores Limited is limited to the amount that Walmart can recover from the third party (or an equitable proportion
thereof to reflect the loss suffered by the Asda Group as compared to the Walmart Group). Walmart is not liable to
Asda Stores Limited to the extent the relevant liability is caused by a failure on the part of the Asda Group to perform
its obligations under the TSA.

**_Transitional Pensions Deed_**

Under the TPD, the LBO Seller indemnifies the LBO Purchaser in respect of any losses incurred by Asda in
respect of the Asda Group Pension Scheme, subject to certain exclusions including that the indemnity will not apply
if the losses arise from a voluntary act by Bellis TopCo Limited (or any other affiliate of Bellis TopCo Limited),
including failure by Asda to comply with its obligations under the documentation governing the Asda Group Pension
Scheme Buy-In. Walmart is party to the TPD and guarantees the obligations of the LBO Seller in respect of this
indemnity. The LBO Purchaser and Bellis TopCo Limited indemnify Asda and Walmart in respect of any losses
incurred by either of them in respect of the Asda Group Pension Scheme if the losses arise from, broadly, a voluntary
act by Bellis TopCo Limited (or any other affiliate of Bellis TopCo Limited), including failure by Asda to comply
with its obligations under the documentation governing the Asda Group Pension Scheme Buy-In. Liability under both
indemnity arrangements terminates on the later of: (i) three years after completion of the buyout of the Asda Group
Pension Scheme; (ii) the date of completion of the winding-up of the Asda Group Pension Scheme; or (iii) (in respect
of losses relate to tax only) five years after the LBO Acquisition Completion Date. As part of the arrangements in
respect of the buy-in of the Asda Group Pension Scheme Asda Stores Limited agreed to make a loan facility available
to the trustees of the Asda Group Pension Scheme. Under the TPD, in the event that a funding obligation arises under
the loan facility which Asda is unable to satisfy, Walmart Inc agrees to use reasonable endeavours to provide
short-term funding to Asda to allow Asda to meet the funding obligation. A buy-out of the Asda Group Pension
Scheme was executed on July 9, 2021 which extinguished the Group’s responsibility to fund the Asda Group Pension
Scheme as sponsoring employer. See “Management’s Discussion & Analysis—Asda Group Pension Scheme Buy-In.”

Solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in the Additional Term Facility, the Additional Term Facility
Notice contains certain additional covenants and/or restrictions on the Group.

Solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in a Financial Covenant Facility (as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement), the Senior Facilities Agreement requires that, in the event that the aggregate amount of all cash
loans drawn under all Financial Covenant Facilities (excluding any ancillary facilities and any utilisations of the
Financial Covenant Facilities by way of letters of credit (or bank guarantees)), any amounts utilised to fund any
original issue discount or flex related payments, fees or expenses or made on the Alaska Closing Date(and any rollover
loans in respect of such utilisations), less any cash and cash equivalents of the Group, exceeds 40% of the aggregate
of (i) the total commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility as at the original date of the Senior Facilities
Agreement (as reduced to reflect the cancellation in full and termination of the Original Revolving Facility 2
Commitments thereafter) and (ii) the aggregate commitments under any additional revolving facility established after
the original date of the Senior Facilities Agreement (including the Additional Revolving Facilities), on the relevant
testing date (the “Revolving Test Condition”), the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed
4.90:1 (the “Financial Covenant”). The Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions
and adjustments in the Senior Facilities Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the Indenture and
the equivalent definitions described in this Offering Memorandum.

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the shareholders of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer to make shareholder injections by way of subordinated shareholder debt and/or equity to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer to (i) increase Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement (an
“EBITDA Cure”), (ii) decrease Consolidated Senior Secured Net Debt as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement
(a “Net Debt Cure”), or (iii) repay or prepay or net off against any outstanding loans or (at the election of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer) any cash drawings outstanding under any ancillary facility, in each case so that the Revolving
Test Condition is no longer met. The EBITDA Cure right may not be exercised on more than five occasions during
the term of the Senior Facilities. No more than two cure rights (which are either EBITDA Cures or Net Debt Cures)
may be exercised in three consecutive financial quarters.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Senior Facilities Agreement will fall
away on the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) a listing has occurred which does not constitute a
Change of Control and the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) for the
relevant period is equal to or less than 2.70:1, (ii) the long-term corporate credit rating of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer (or, as the case may be, any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) is equal to or better than
Baa3 according to Moody’s or BBB- according to S&P and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, or (iii) Facility B (EUR) has achieved and maintained Investment Grade Status (as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement) and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement provides (or will provide with effect from the Issue Date and the amendment
and restatement of the Senior Facilities Agreement) for substantially the same events of default as under the Senior
Secured Notes. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement provides for additional events of default, subject to
customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) (for the benefit of the lenders participating in a
Financial Covenant Facility only) breach of the financial covenant; (ii) inaccuracy of a representation or statement
when made; (iii) invalidity and unlawfulness of the Finance documents (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement);
and (iv) material failure to comply with the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with it,
are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with English law, although the
information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions scheduled to the Senior
Facilities Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without prejudice to the fact that the
Senior Facilities Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Senior Notes
Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into an intercreditor agreement on February 12, 2021 (the
“Intercreditor Agreement”) with, among others, the Security Agent and the agents, arrangers and lenders under the
Senior Facilities Agreement. Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, in its capacity as trustee under the Senior Notes
Indenture, acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Topco Notes Trustee (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) on February 24, 2021. Asda Stores Limited and Asda Group Limited acceded to the Intercreditor
Agreement on the LBO Acquisition Completion Date and McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood House
Group Limited acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement on May 17, 2021. The Senior Secured Notes Trustee is
expected to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Senior Secured Notes Trustee (as defined in the Intercreditor
Agreement) on or about the Issue Date of the Senior Secured Notes. On or about the Issue Date of the Senior Secured
Notes, the Senior Secured Notes will be designated “Senior Secured Notes” under and pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement.

By accepting a Senior Secured Note, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be deemed to have agreed to,
and accepted the terms and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement is governed by English law and sets out various matters governing the
relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Senior Notes Issuer, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party to the Intercreditor Agreement
as a Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider, when payments can be made in respect of debt of the Debtors or
Third-Party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to
which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover
provisions and provisions related to the enforcement of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions to be contained in the Intercreditor Agreement.
It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that document because it, and
not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and of the Senior
Secured Notes Trustee. Capitalised terms used in this section “—Intercreditor Agreement” but not defined herein have
the meanings given to them in the Intercreditor Agreement.

by, or in relation to which a New Debt Financing (as defined below) has been made available to or by, a member of
the Group which are designated by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as Senior Secured Notes under the Intercreditor
Agreement, and references to the “Topco Notes” shall include the Existing Senior Notes, any additional notes issued
from time to time under the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, and any other notes, securities or other debt instruments
issued or to be issued by, or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has been made available to or by, a Topco
Borrower (as defined below) which are designated by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as Topco Notes.

The Intercreditor Agreement uses the term the “Company” to refer to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,

Notes and certain other indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

Independent Obligor in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

“Topco Independent Transaction Security” refers to any Security granted by a Topco Independent Obligor
(excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, any asset which at the time any security is granted in respect thereof comprises
Transaction Security) and provided that any Topco Independent Transaction Security granted by any member of the
Group that is a direct shareholder of a Topco Borrower shall be limited to only such shares and any intercompany
loans or other receivables owed to such member of the Group by the relevant Topco Borrower and provided further
that any recourse to such member of the Group under such Topco Independent Transaction Security shall be limited
only to the assets the subject of the Topco Independent Transaction Security; and provided further that such shares or
receivables are not subject to (or are not required at such time of any designation by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
of Topco Independent Transaction Security in relation thereto to be subject to) the Transaction Security pursuant to
the provisions of any Finance Document which, to the extent legally possible and subject to any Topco Agreed
Security Principles and the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement: (i) is created, or expressed to be created, in
favour of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Topco Secured Parties (as defined below) (or a class of
Topco Secured Parties) in respect of the Topco Independent Secured Obligations; or (ii) in the case of any jurisdiction
in which effective Security cannot be granted in favour of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the Topco Secured
Parties (or a class of Topco Secured Parties) is created, or expressed to be created in favour of: (x) all the Topco
Secured Parties (or a class of Topco Secured Parties) in respect of the Topco Independent Secured Obligations; or
(y) the Security Agent under a parallel debt and/or joint and several creditorship structure for the benefit of all the
Topco Secured Parties (or a class of Topco Secured Parties) in respect of the Topco Independent Secured Obligations,
and which is in each case (unless otherwise designated by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in its discretion) by written
notice to each Agent who is a party to the Intercreditor Agreement at such time) not in favour of the other Secured
Parties and subject to certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement.

“Topco Shared Security” refers to security at any time which is created, or expressed to be created, over
any of the following: (i) the shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer held by any direct shareholder of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, (ii) all receivables owed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to a Topco Investor, Subordinated
Creditor or other holding company or shareholder of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (including any Topco Proceeds
Loan and the Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities), (iii) the shares in any Topco Borrower which is a member of the

225


-----

Group, (iv) all receivables owed by a member of the Group under any Topco Proceeds Loan (or, in the case of a Topco
Borrower which is a member of the Group, any Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan), (v) any escrow account relating
to the proceeds of any Topco Liabilities and (vi) any other assets not falling within limbs (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) of
this paragraph of a Topco Borrower (if not a member of the Group) and (to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
has confirmed to the Security Agent that the granting of such Security in favour of the Topco Shared Security Secured
Obligations is not prohibited by the terms of any applicable Prior Ranking Financing Agreements) of any member of
the Group, in each case to the extent provided for by the Topco Finance Documents (as defined below) at any time
and in each case designated as Topco Shared Security by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in its discretion) in favour
of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or if such trustee arrangements are not legally
possible, in favour of all the Secured Parties or in favour of the Security Agent under a parallel debt or similar
structure). Topco Shared Security shall secure all liabilities and present and future obligations of each Topco Borrower
that is not a member of the Group and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the documents governing the
relevant Topco Notes or Topco Facility (as the case may be)) (the “Topco Group”), each Debtor and (only to the
extent it has expressly assumed any such liabilities or obligations) each Third-Party Security Provider to the Secured
Parties under the Secured Debt Documents.

“Transaction Security” refers to security from the Group, any Third-Party Security Provider and any Topco
Shared Security (but excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Topco Independent Transaction Security) which is created,
or expressed to be created, in favour of the Security Agent as agent or trustee for the other Secured Parties (or if such
trustee arrangements are not legally possible, in favour of all the Secured Parties or in favour of the Security Agent
under a parallel debt or similar structure). Transaction Security which is not Topco Shared Security shall secure all
liabilities and present and future obligations of the Debtors and Third-Party Security Providers to the Secured Parties
(other than the creditors under the Topco Liabilities (the “Topco Secured Parties”)) under the Debt Documents (other
than the finance documents relating to the Topco Liabilities (the “Topco Finance Documents”)).

The Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees will constitute Senior Secured Notes Liabilities for the
purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement and, as of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Designation Date has
not occurred.

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements or the assumption or incurrence of any liabilities that will
constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities,
Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Topco Liabilities, Super Senior
Liabilities or unsecured liabilities subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (each, a “New Debt Financing”). The
conditions include certification by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that such New Debt Financing is not prohibited
under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, set-off,
discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional or supplemental financing, guarantee or debt arrangement
under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any New Debt Financing, each
agent and the Security Agent (and each other person party to a Transaction Security document or a Topco Independent
Transaction Security document) is authorised and instructed to promptly enter into any new security document, amend
or waive any term of an existing security document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security (as the case may be) subject to certain conditions, including as regards the terms of
such security (which shall be, unless otherwise agreed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or otherwise required by
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, substantially the same as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness (“Permitted Acquired Indebtedness”) which is not prohibited under the Finance
Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its subsidiaries who, after the
Effective Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is otherwise combined with a Restricted
Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of any such person or which is otherwise acquired after the Effective Date
(together, an “Acquired Person or Asset”), any security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in
respect of such New Debt Financing which is subsisting at the date when the conditions to the incurrence of such New
Debt Financing set out in the Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter, including

226


-----

subject to any condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist (or to be granted) and there is no requirement
to offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any Debt
Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be given by any member
of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over any Acquired Person
or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group or is excluded or exempt from
being given under the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement), (ii) over any asset
required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit support in relation to any Permitted Acquired
Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to extend any Transaction Security rateably for the benefit of
such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or (iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other
assurance against loss is prevented by the documentation in relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would
give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend any Transaction
Security rateably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third-Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and Cash Management Facility Liabilities
(together with the Hedging Liabilities, the “Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities,” the creditors in respect thereof
being the “Senior Secured Creditors”) at any time, provided that following certain acceleration events under the
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, any Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or following certain insolvency events in relation
to a member of the Group, payments may only be made by Debtors or Third-Party Security Providers and received by
creditors in accordance with the provisions described below under “Application of Proceeds”; provided that after the
Designation Date there shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments received, other than those related to an
enforcement of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of assets subject to the Transaction
Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event or insolvency event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the occurrence of
an event of default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Second Lien Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge
Date, the Debtors, the Third-Party Security Providers and other members of the Group may only make specified
payments (including any other direct or indirect step, matter, action or dealing in relation to any Second Lien Liabilities
otherwise prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement) under the Second Lien Liabilities to the Second Lien
Creditors (such payments, collectively, “Permitted Second Lien Payments”):

(i) if:

(1) no Second Lien Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(2) no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than
principal, interest or certain fees) has occurred and is continuing under any Permitted
Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Cash Management Facility document or Senior Secured Notes document (a
“Senior Secured Payment Default”); and

(3) the payment is (1) of any amount of principal or capitalised interest in respect of the Second
Lien Liabilities which is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements (in
respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities), or, to the extent prohibited, any required consents
to permit such payment have been obtained, (2) of any other amounts which is not an
amount of principal or capitalised interest including all scheduled interest payments
(including, if applicable, special interest or liquidated damages), the accrual of cash interest

227


-----

otherwise payable during a period when a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice (as defined
below) is outstanding and default interest on the Second Lien Liabilities accrued and
payable in accordance with the terms of the relevant Second Lien Finance Document (as
at the date of the issue of the same or as amended in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and the other Debt Documents), additional amounts payable as a
result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to Second Lien Liabilities and amounts in
respect of currency indemnities in any Second Lien Finance Document, (3) made in
pursuance of a debt buy-back programme approved by the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors and Majority Super Senior Creditors (each as defined below), or (4) amounts due
under any syndication strategy letter relating to the Second Lien Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and/or
(other than in respect of paragraph (L) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default has occurred and
is continuing and irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking financing agreements
have accelerated their debt or the payment is (without double-counting any equivalent applicable
basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not permitted by the Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing
fees under any original fee letter relating to the Second Lien Finance Documents, (B) of
commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for restructuring advice and valuations
(including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate financial and/or restructuring advisors)
and a Second Lien Creditor Representative’s fees, costs and expenses not exceeding €1,500,000 in
aggregate, but excluding the costs of any litigation against a Senior Secured Creditor (or their
affiliates), (C) of any amounts owed to a Second Lien Agent (as defined below), (D) of costs
necessary to protect, preserve or enforce security, (E) of any costs, commissions, taxes, premiums,
amendment fees (including any original issue discount and other consent and/or waiver fees) and
any expenses incurred in respect of (or reasonably incidental to) the Second Lien Finance
Documents (including in relation to any reporting or listing requirements under the Second Lien
Finance Documents), (F) of any other amount not exceeding €4,000,000 (equivalent) in aggregate
in any 12-month period, (G) of any amount of the Second Lien Liabilities which would have been
payable but for the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired and where
no new Second Lien Payment Stop Notice is outstanding) which has been capitalised and added to
the principal amount of the Second Lien Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding as a result
of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities during such period
or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment may be made if certain
events of default have occurred or would occur as a result of making such payment, (H) for as long
as an event of default under the Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities is continuing,
of all or part of the Second Lien Liabilities being released or otherwise discharged solely in
consideration for the issues of shares in any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
Topco (a “Debt for Equity Swap”) provided that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in
respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, that it does not result in a Change of Control (as defined in
any prior ranking finance agreement) and that any liabilities under the Debt Documents owed by a
member of the Group to another member of the Group, to the Subordinated Creditors or to any other
holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity
Swap are subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Senior Secured Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those liabilities
under the Debt Documents owed by any member of the Group to the extent such Transaction
Security is required to be granted pursuant to the terms of the Secured Debt Documents, (I) of
non-cash interest made by way of capitalising interest or issuing a non-cash-pay instrument which
is subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities on the same terms as the Second Lien Liabilities,
(J) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Second Lien Liabilities or
Topco Liabilities incurred respectively under or pursuant to any Second Lien Finance Document
and/or Topco Finance Document, (K) if the payment is of a principal amount of the Second Lien
Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a Second Lien Finance Document relating to
prepayment upon illegality or in relation to the prepayment of a single lender in the event of a tax
gross-up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming payable and (L) if no Senior Secured
Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and the payment is a payment of principal, interest
or any other amounts made on or after the final maturity of the relevant Second Lien Liabilities

228


-----

(provided that such maturity date is no earlier than that contained in the original form of the relevant
Second Lien Finance Document as of the first date of borrowing or issuance (as the case may be) of
the applicable Second Lien Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors and Super Senior Creditors give prior consent to that
payment being made.

On or after the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Debtors
and the Third-Party Security Providers may make payments in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities in accordance
with the Second Lien Finance Documents.

_Second Lien Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Second Lien Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following the
occurrence of certain material events of default, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the requisite Super
Senior Creditors or Senior Secured Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be delivered) (a
“Second Lien Payment Stop Notice”) to the Second Lien Creditor Representative(s) advising that the relevant event
of default is continuing and suspending payments of the Second Lien Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 120 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity of
the relevant Second Lien Liabilities;

(iii) if a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Second Lien
Payment Stop Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant material event of default has been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super Senior
Creditors or Senior Secured Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice to be
delivered) delivers a notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Second Lien Creditor
Representative cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Second Lien Creditors take any enforcement action that they are permitted
under the Intercreditor Agreement (see “Enforcement Regime—Permitted Second Lien
_Enforcement” below)._

No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a particular
relevant event of default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant event of default. No more than one
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of circumstances or (ii) in
any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities as a result of the issue of a
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default shall not prevent (i) the
occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to the relevant Second
Lien Liabilities or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event of default under the finance documents
documenting any Second Lien Liabilities (a “Second Lien Enforcement Notice”) on behalf of the Second Lien
Creditors.

_Payment Obligations and Capitalisation of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor or Third-Party
Security Provider from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue to accrue)
under the applicable Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted at any time. The accrual

229


-----

and Capitalisation of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt Documents shall continue
notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior
Secured Payment Default that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be outstanding and/or
(as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default ceases to be continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Creditors an amount equal to any
payments which had accrued under the Second Lien Finance Documents and which would have
been Permitted Second Lien Payments but for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or Senior
Secured Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Second Lien Finance Document and any Second
Lien Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that suspension of payments shall be deemed
automatically waived without any further action being required by the Second Lien Creditors.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities (together, the “Secured Liabilities”) have been discharged (the
“Priority Discharge Date”), the Debtors, the members of the Group, the Topco Borrowers and the Third-Party
Security Providers may only make specified payments in respect of the Topco Liabilities, in accordance with the
finance documents governing such Topco Liabilities, subject to compliance with certain conditions in the Intercreditor
Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalised interest)
is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, any Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any Second Lien
Facility Agreement and any Second Lien Notes Indenture (or if it is so prohibited, that all necessary consents have
been obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has been issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Topco
Liabilities and Senior Secured Payment Default or payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of
amounts other than principal, interest or certain fees) is continuing under the Second Lien Facility Agreement.

Certain specified payments in respect of Topco Liabilities are also permitted at all times, notwithstanding
that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These payments and basket amounts
are substantially similar to those referenced for Second Lien Liabilities in (ii) of “Permitted Payments in Respect of
_Second Lien Liabilities” above._

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, at any time prior to the latest to
occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the first date on which all of the Second
Lien Liabilities have been fully discharged (the “Second Lien Discharge Date”) and the first date on which all of the
Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the “Topco Discharge Date”) (the “Final Discharge Date”) any
creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor,
member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the
creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either (x) not
prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the provisions set out
below under “Application of Proceeds”;

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

230


-----

(iii) any amount:

(1) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any other
litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Group or any Third-Party
Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined
below)); or

(2) by way of set-off in respect of any of the Liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with the
provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds”; or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the
liabilities owed by any Debtor, any member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider which is
not in accordance with the provisions set out below under “Application of Proceeds” and which is
made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that Debtor, member
of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an amount
of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount received or
recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security Agent and
promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute an amount equal to the
amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant liabilities to the Security
Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after the
Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or recovers from any
Debtor, any member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds from the enforcement of security
or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an acceleration event or the enforcement of security,
any proceeds arising from any of the charged property or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received
or recovered by the Security Agent except in accordance with the provisions set out below under “Application of
_Proceeds.”_

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

“Insolvency Event” is defined as, in relation to a Debtor, Material Subsidiary (as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement) or Third-Party Security Provider, (a) any resolution is passed or order made for insolvency,
bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration, examination or reorganisation (excluding solvent
reorganisations), (b) a composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any class of creditors generally
(other than any Secured Party) in connection with or as a result of any financial difficulty on the part of that Obligor,
Material Subsidiary or Third-Party Security Provider, (c) a moratorium is declared in relation to any of its
indebtedness, (d) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, examiner, administrative receiver, administrator,
compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or (e) any analogous procedure or step
is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or vexatious proceedings, proceedings or appointments
which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn or unsuccessful or as permitted under the Senior Facilities

231


-----

Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party entitled to
receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third-Party Security Provider (in the case
of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay that distribution to the Security Agent until
the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full. The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions
paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out under “Application of _Proceeds” below._

To the extent any member of the Group’s or Third-Party Security Provider’s liabilities to creditors are, with
certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor
on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall pay an amount equal to the amount
of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the Security Agent for application in accordance
with the provisions set out under “Application of Proceeds” below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in respect
of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent the realisation
proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorises the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands, collect and
receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the occurrence of an
Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor, member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider. The creditors agree
to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Instructing Group_

An “Instructing Group” means:

(1) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(a) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors;

(b) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the
Majority Second Lien Creditors; and

(c) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority
Topco Creditors (as defined below); and

(2) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(a) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the Super
Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the “Super Senior Discharge
**Date”), the Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors) representing**
more than 50% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super Senior Liabilities)
(the “Majority Senior Secured Creditors”), and Super Senior Creditors representing more
than 50% of the Super Senior Liabilities (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”) save that,
for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall mean the group of Secured Creditors
entitled to give instructions in accordance with the enforcement regime described under
“Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date” and “Enforcement of
Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date” below;

232


-----

(b) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge
Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the Second Lien Creditors representing more
than 50% of the Second Lien Liabilities (the “Majority Second Lien Creditors”); and

(c) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Topco
Creditors representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the “Majority Topco
**Creditors”).**

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security unless
instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Instructing
Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and
(B) not required any Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal (as defined below), an
agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors)
where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if,
prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (or Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have
(A) given no instructions or have instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not
required any Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Topco
Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the Instructing
Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding paragraph may give or refrain
from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from enforcing, the Transaction Security as they
see fit.

Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction Security
either give no such instruction or do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Instructing Group
may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the Instructing Group sees fit and
the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the
Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good faith that to
do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the
Transaction Security or the realisation proceeds of any such enforcement, before giving any instructions to enforce
the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action the agents of the creditors represented in the Instructing
Group will be required to consult with each other agent (provided that any agent or trustee in respect of Topco
Liabilities need only be consulted if such enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) and the Security Agent in
good faith for a period of up to 10 business days (the “Consultation Period”) and the Instructing Group will only be
entitled to give the enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry of such
Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in the following paragraphs.

If the Transaction Security has become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions, they shall deliver a copy of those
instructions (an “Initial Enforcement Notice”) to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and hedge
counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided that they are consistent with the
Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, (ii) if the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to
instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or the Super Senior

233


-----

Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the Majority Super Senior
Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency Event (other than an Insolvency
Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Majority
Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to
pursue and the Majority Super Senior Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent’s ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the realisation
of proceeds and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent
with the Enforcement Principles and necessary or advisable to enhance the prospects of achieving the Enforcement
Objective (as defined below) before the Security Agent has received any instructions from the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the
later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent
not to enforce or cease enforcing the Transaction Security and neither the Majority Senior Secured Creditor or the
Majority Super Senior Creditors has required any Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider to make a Distressed
Disposal, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors), where the rights of
the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the Priority
Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the Majority Second
Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or
cease enforcing or the Transaction Security and neither the Majority Senior Secured Creditors nor the Majority Super
Senior Creditors has required any Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security
Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors), or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as
applicable) has.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give no such instruction or do
not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or Majority Super
Senior Creditors, to the extent such group is entitled to give enforcement

“Enforcement Principles” means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that (i) to
the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realisation of value, the method of enforcement chosen should
maximise the value realised from such enforcement (the “Enforcement Objective”), (ii) certain proceeds must be
received in cash, and (iii) enforcement in relation to secured assets (other than shares) over €5,000,000 (equivalent)
or shares, in each case, if not carried out by way of a public auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the
Security Agent is requested to do so by the Majority Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors)
benefit from a fairness opinion from an independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party professional
firm which is regularly engaged in issuing such opinions (subject to certain exceptions).

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its
terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors) may give or refrain from giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain from enforcing the
Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance with
any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any administrator of any Debtor
or Third-Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any persons entitled at any time under the
above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may
include taking no action).

No Secured Party (other than the Security Agent) shall have any independent power to enforce, or to have
recourse to enforce, any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to exercise any rights or
powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

234


-----

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than the
Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
in accordance with instructions given by the relevant instructing creditors in accordance with the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Until the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with the
prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group, no Second Lien Creditor shall take or require the taking of
any Enforcement Action against a member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider in relation to the Second
Lien Liabilities except as set out under “Permitted Second Lien Enforcement,” provided that no such action required
by an Instructing Group need be taken except to the extent such Instructing Group otherwise is entitled under the
Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

“Enforcement Action” is defined as:

(i) (A) in relation to any liabilities (other than unsecured liabilities), the acceleration, the making of any
declaration that such liabilities are payable on demand (subject to certain exceptions), making
certain demands, requiring a member of the Topco Group or Third-Party Security Provider to

certain netting under hedging agreements or as otherwise permitted under the Secured Debt
Documents) or (B) suing or commencing proceedings in relation to such liabilities;

(ii) premature termination or close-out of a hedging agreement, save to the extent permitted by the

Third-Party Security Provider or a member of the Topco Group which owes any liabilities or has
given security, guarantees, indemnities or other assurances against loss in respect of liabilities owed
to a creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement (other than any action permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement or any debt buy-backs pursuant to open market debt repurchases, tender
offers or exchange offers not undertaken as part of an announced restructuring or turnaround plan
or while a default was outstanding under the relevant Secured Debt Documents); or

(v) petitioning, applying, voting for or taking any steps (including the appointment of any liquidator,
receiver, administrator or similar officer) in relation to the winding up, dissolution, administration
or reorganisation of any Third-Party Security Provider or a member of the Topco Group which owes
any liabilities or has given security or guarantees in respect of liabilities owed to a creditor under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any of such Third-Party Security Provider or member of the Topco
Group’s assets or any suspension of payments or moratorium of any indebtedness of any such
Third-Party Security Provider or member of the Topco Group, or any analogous procedure or step
in any jurisdiction,

except that the following shall not constitute Enforcement Action: (A) taking any action referred to in paragraph (i)(B)
and (v) where necessary to preserve the validity, existence or priority of any claim, (B) discussions between or
proposals made by the Priority Secured Parties with respect to enforcement of the Transaction Security in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement, (C) bringing proceedings in connection with a securities violation, securities or
listing regulations or common law fraud or to restrain any breach of the Debt Documents or for specific performance
with no claims for damages, (D) proceedings brought by a Secured Party solely to obtain injunctive relief, specific
performance with no claim for damages or to request judicial interpretation in relation to a Debt Document to which

235


-----

it is party with no claim for damages, (E) demands made by intra-group lenders or Subordinated Creditors to the extent
they relate to payments permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or the release of the liabilities owed to such
creditors in return for the issue of shares in the relevant member of the Group provided that the ownership interest of
the member of the Group is not diluted and any relevant shares remain subject to the same Transaction Security as
existed prior to the issue, (F) proceedings brought by an ancillary lender, a lender of Cash Management Facility
Liabilities (a “Cash Management Facility Lender”), hedge counterparty, issuing bank, or agent or trustee in respect
of the Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities solely to obtain injunctive relief, specific performance with no
claim for damages or to request judicial interpretation in relation to a Debt Document to which it is party with no
claim for damages or in connection with any securities violation, securities or listing regulations or common law fraud
or to restrain any breach of the Debt Documents or for specific performance with no claims for damages, and (G) the
taking of any action by a member of the Topco Group not prohibited by the Finance Documents.

_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under “Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors” will not apply
in respect of any of the Second Lien Liabilities owed to it if at the same time as, or prior to, that action:

(i) a Super Senior Acceleration Event or a Senior Acceleration Event or a Senior Secured Notes
Acceleration Event has occurred in which case, each Second Lien Creditor may take the same
Enforcement Action (but in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities) as constitutes that Super Senior
Acceleration Event or Senior Acceleration Event or Senior Secured Notes Acceleration Event;

(ii) a Second Lien Creditor Representative has given notice (a “Second Lien Enforcement Notice”) to
the Security Agent specifying that a second lien event of default (save and except arising pursuant
to a breach of any provisions in the relevant Second Lien Facility Agreement relating to cross default
(including to the Senior Facilities Agreement or any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement
or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement)) under the Second Lien Finance
Documents in respect of which it is an agent has occurred and is continuing and:

(1) a period (a “Second Lien Standstill Period”) of not less than:

(a) 90 days in the case of a failure to make a payment of an amount of principal,
interest or fees representing the Second Lien Liabilities; or

(b) 120 days in the case of an event of default under any financial maintenance
covenant in any Second Lien Facility Agreement substantially equivalent to the
Financial Covenant of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement; or

(c) 150 days in the case of any other second lien event of default,

or, in relation to any Second Lien Liabilities, such longer period (if any) as agreed between
the Group (in its discretion) and the Second Lien Creditor Representative in relation to
such Second Lien Liabilities and notified to the Security Agent in each case which has
elapsed from the date on which that Second Lien Enforcement Notice becomes effective
in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(2) that second lien event of default is continuing at the end of the Second Lien Standstill
Period; or

(iii) at the same time as or prior to that action the consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors and
the Majority Super Senior Creditors for that Enforcement Action is obtained.

To the extent permitted under applicable law, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each Second Lien
Creditor may (unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken, or has given
notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that Second Lien Creditor) exercise any right they may otherwise
have against that Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third-Party Security Provider to:

(i) accelerate any of that Debtor’s or, as the case may be, Third-Party Security Provider’s or Material

236


-----

Subsidiary’s Second Lien Liabilities or declare them prematurely due and payable or payable on
demand;

(ii) make a demand under any guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss given by that Debtor
or, as the case may be, Third-Party Security Provider or Material Subsidiary in respect of any Second
Lien Liabilities;

(iii) exercise any right of set off or take or receive any payment or claim in respect of any Second Lien
Liabilities of that Debtor or, as the case may be, Third-Party Security Provider or Material
Subsidiary; or

(iv) claim and prove in the liquidation, administration or other insolvency proceedings of that Debtor or,
as the case may be, Third-Party Security Provider or Material Subsidiary for the Second Lien
Liabilities owing to it.

_Option to Purchase: Second Lien Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Second Lien Creditors may, subject to
certain conditions, elect to purchase the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities and the Cash Management Facility Liabilities for the amount that would have been required to prepay
or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Second Lien Creditors must also, at the same
time, elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer their hedging obligations to holders in exchange
(subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would have been payable under such hedging obligations had
they been terminated on such date plus certain costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

Certain of the features set out above with respect to Second Lien Creditors apply to the Topco Creditors, with
appropriate modifications for the relative positions of the relevant liabilities in the capital structure of the Group.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
document evidencing the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security shall (and is irrevocably
authorised, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement or instruction from any creditor, other
Secured Party or Debtor), and without prejudice to its rights and protections under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
other Debt Document, promptly following receipt of a written request from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer:

(i) release (or procure the release) from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security and the Secured Debt Documents:

(1) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset which the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed is the subject of:

(a) a disposal not prohibited under the Finance Documents or where any applicable
release and/or consent has been obtained under the applicable Finance Document
including a disposal to a member of the Group but without prejudice to any
obligation of any member of the Group in a Finance Document to provide
replacement security; or

(b) any other transaction not prohibited by the Finance Documents pursuant to which
that asset will cease to be held or owned by a member of the Group (or, to the
extent any applicable Finance Document prohibits such transaction, the applicable
Agent authorises the release in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Finance Document or the required creditor consent for such transaction has been
obtained); and

237


-----

in each case where such disposal or other transaction is not a Distressed Disposal (as
defined below) (in each case, a “Non-Distressed Disposal”);

(2) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other
agreement requested in order for any member of the Group to effect any amendment or
waiver or otherwise exercise any rights, comply with any obligation or take any action in
relation to such document or agreement (to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has
confirmed that such action is not prohibited by any Finance Document);

(3) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any asset of any
member of the Group which has ceased or will cease to be a Debtor or guarantor to the
extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed that such ceasing to be a Debtor or
guarantor in accordance with the terms of each Finance Document or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement);

(4) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any other asset to the
extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed that such security is not required to
be given or such release in accordance with the terms of any Finance Document or the
Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement); and

(5) any security (and/or any other claim relating to a Debt Document) provided by, or in
relation to (including in respect of the share capital of, or any receivable owing by), a
member of the Group that becomes a member of the Regulated Group; and

(ii) in the case of a disposal of share or ownership interest in a Debtor, other member of the Group or
any holding company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, other
member of the Group or any holding company of any Debtor will cease to be a member of the Topco
Group or a Debtor, release or procure the release of that Debtor or other member of the Group and
its subsidiaries from all present and future liabilities under the Secured Debt Documents and the
respective assets of such Debtor and its subsidiaries from the Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security and the Secured Debt Documents (including any claim relating
to a Debt Document).

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraphs (i)(1)(a), (i)(1)(b) or (ii) above, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer shall certify in writing to the Security Agent, that the relevant disposal or other action is not
prohibited as at the date of completion of such release or, at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, on the date
that the definitive agreement for such disposal or similar transaction is entered into.

When making any request for a release pursuant to paragraph (i)(3), (i)(4) or (i)(5) above, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer shall certify in writing to the Security Agent, that such security is not required to be given or the relevant
release or cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance Documents or the Agreed Security
Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Group or holding
company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the Group or holding company
of any Debtor will cease to be a member of Topco Group or a Debtor, to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
has confirmed to the Security Agent that it is not prohibited by the Finance Documents, if such member of the Topco
Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under any Debt Document, such person shall have the right
to voluntarily prepay all Liabilities outstanding under any Debt Document to the applicable creditors.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

“Distressed Disposal” means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued by a
member of the Group or, in the case of a Third-Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or financial securities
which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the request of an Instructing Group in
circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an acceleration event, (b) by
enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration event, or (c) after the occurrence of an

238


-----

acceleration event or the enforcement of security as a result of an acceleration event, by a Debtor or Third-Party
Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a member of the Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (at the
cost of the relevant Debtor, Third-Party Security Provider and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and without any
consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement, Third-Party
Security Provider or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release of that
Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallisation of any floating charge or
any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(1) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing,
guarantee or other liabilities;

(2) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over any
of its assets; and

(3) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or
another Debtor over that Debtor’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor,
on behalf of the relevant creditors, Third-Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a Debtor
to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from all or any
part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security granted by that
holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its assets, and (C) any other
claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or another Debtor over that
holding company’s assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the
relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company
of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides
to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or holding company or any of
their subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(1) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the “Transferee”) will be treated as a Secured
Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into
any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, provided that, notwithstanding
any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be treated as a Secured
Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(2) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend
that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose of all (and not
part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third-Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding company
of a Debtor (the “Disposed Entity”) and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the “Receiving Entity”) all or any
part of the Disposed Entity’s obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of that Disposed Entity
in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to execute and deliver or
enter into any agreement to:

239


-----

(1) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities
to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(2) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is
also a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of
the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on
behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of
those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as described
above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under “—
_Application of Proceeds” below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of the Transaction Security_
and, to the extent any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the Security
Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing market conditions
(although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such Distressed Disposal or disposal of
liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled to
give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorised
to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities or other
liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities or other
liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent
liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash
collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to give,
and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not authorised to
release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities owed to any
Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any
other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any
contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of
cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured
Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or unsecured
liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor concerned may elect to
have those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities transferred to a holding company of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in which case the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (at the cost of the relevant
Debtor or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from
any creditor or Debtor) to execute such documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities, guarantee
liabilities and/or other liabilities.

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal
of Liabilities pursuant to (iv) or (v) above) is being effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities or the Topco
Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares in a borrower, issuer or guarantor of, or over assets of a borrower,
issuer or guarantor of, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities will be released, transferred or disposed of pursuant
to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release, transfer or disposal that either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent, second lien notes trustee, Topco Agent and Topco Notes Trustee (as
applicable) have approved the release, transfer or disposal (acting, in each case, upon the instructions
of the relevant Creditor group); or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities or
Topco Guarantor are sold:

240


-----

(1) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash) and/or
other marketable securities or, if the consideration for such sale or disposal is not in cash
(or substantially all in cash) and/or other marketable securities, a valuation opinion has
been obtained in accordance with the provisions set out below; and

(2) all borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and (to the extent permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors and
unsecured creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold or disposed
of pursuant to such Enforcement Action (together, the “Relevant Claim”), are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such sale
(and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all Transaction Security,
Topco Independent Transaction Security or other security in favour of the Secured Parties
in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously and unconditionally
released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that in the event of a sale or
disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge):

(a) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior
Agent, each Senior Secured Notes Trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and in
good faith, that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover more than if such
Relevant Claim was released or discharged but nevertheless less than the
aggregate amount of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, and (ii) serve a notice
on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

(b) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second
Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and
in good faith that the Priority Secured Parties (collectively) will recover more than
if such claim was released or discharged but nevertheless less than the outstanding
amount of the liabilities owed to the Priority Secured Parties (the “Priority
**Secured Liabilities”), and (ii) serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the**
Security Agent of the same; and

(c) where the Topco Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Topco Agent and
the Topco Notes Trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that the
Priority Secured Parties and the Topco Creditors (collectively) will recover more
than if such claim was released or discharged but is nevertheless less than the
outstanding Priority Secured Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (collectively),
and serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such
Relevant Claim to such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration
for such sale or transfer may be in the form of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior
Secured Creditors, Second Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors (whichever constitutes the
Instructing Group) bidding by an appropriate mechanic all or part of the Senior Secured
Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities (as applicable) such that the
relevant liabilities would on completion be discharged to the extent of an amount equal to
the amount of the offer made by the relevant creditors; and

(3) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(a) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process run in accordance
with the advice of a reputable, independent and internationally recognised
investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party professional firm which is
regularly engaged in such sale processes with a view to obtaining the best price
reasonably obtainable taking into account all relevant circumstances and in which
creditors under the Second Lien Liabilities and Topco Liabilities are entitled to
participate as prospective buyers and/or financiers; or

241


-----

(b) where a reputable, independent and internationally recognised investment bank,
firm of accountants or third-party professional firm which is regularly engaged in
providing such valuations has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise
valuation of the Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent (acting on
the instructions of the Instructing Group) and disclosed to the Senior Secured
Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance
basis) in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount is fair from a financial
point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method
of enforcement, _provided that the liability of such investment bank or_
internationally recognised firm of accountants or third-party professional firm in
giving such opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such
engagement.

**_Application of Proceeds_**

_Order of Application—Transaction Security_

Subject to certain provisions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement and to the proviso described below, all
amounts from time to time received or recovered by the Security Agent pursuant to the terms of any Debt Document

of any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (other than a member of the Group) in respect of any
Topco Liabilities or Topco Proceeds Loan Liabilities) or in connection with the realisation or enforcement of all or
any part of the Transaction Security shall be applied at any time as the Security Agent sees fit, in the following order

(v) the balance, if any, in payment to the relevant Debtor.

**_Equalisation_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the first date
on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the “Enforcement Date”) and the resulting losses are not
borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their respective exposures at the
Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that specified class at the Enforcement Date,
the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put
the relevant creditors in such a position that (after taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those
proportions. The enforceability of these equalisation provisions is uncertain.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or waived
only with the consent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured Parties, and the
Security Agent, provided that, to the extent an amendment, waiver or consent only affects one class of creditors, and
such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected materially or adversely to affect the interests of
the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from the relevant agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected
class (or, in the case of Hedge Counterparties, each affected Hedge Counterparty) and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates to,
among other matters, the provisions set out under “Application of Proceeds” above and the order of priority or
subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of each of the agents or trustees
(acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities,
the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, each Cash Management Facility Lender (only to the extent the
proposed amendment or waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management
Facility Lender under the Intercreditor Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations
of any other creditor or class of creditors), each Hedge Counterparty (only to the extent the proposed amendment or
waiver would materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor
Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class of
creditors), and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors it
represents or as otherwise authorised by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions or
authorisations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorised to relate to any
provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security Agent

244


-----

may, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer consents: (i) amend the terms of, release or waive any of the requirements of
or grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security
which shall be binding on each party; (ii) (promptly upon request by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) amend or release
and retake any Transaction Security Documents or Topco Independent Transaction Security Documents where such
amendment or release and retake is required in order to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the Transaction
Security purported to be created under such Transaction Security Document or Topco Independent Transaction
Security Documents, together with any related or consequential waiver and any such amendment, release, waiver and
retake shall be binding on each party; and (iii) any amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document
creating Transaction Security which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to Transaction
Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security are distributed, shall not be made without the consent of:

(i) each of the Agents (other than the agent in respect of any Cash Management Facility) acting in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable Finance Documents;

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (or the relevant Cash Management Facility Agent on its
behalf, if appointed) but only to the extent such amendment or waiver would (i) materially adversely
affect the rights and obligations of the Cash Management Facility lenders under the Intercreditor
Agreement in their capacity as such, and (ii) would not materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of any Creditor or class of Creditors other than the Cash Management Facility lenders
(solely in their capacity as such);

(iii) each Hedge Counterparty but only to the extent such amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of the Hedge Counterparties under the Intercreditor
Agreement in their capacity as such, and would not materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of any Creditor or class of Creditors other than the Hedge Counterparties (solely in their
capacity as such); and

(iv) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or obligations
which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such (including, without limitation,
any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor Agreement) may not be effected
without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be, Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under “Amendments and Waivers: Transaction
_Security Documents” are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in particular to_
(i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security, claim or liabilities, or (ii) any
amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in accordance with the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or refinancing debt or the provisions set out under
“New Debt Financing,” “Non-Distressed Disposals” and “Distressed Disposals” above. Any release, amendment,
waiver or consent effected in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters
can be effected solely by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any action
or to provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement or any other Debt
Document which does not contain a snooze/lose provision substantially similar to that contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Secured Creditor or Unsecured Creditor fails to respond to the request within 10 business days (or
any other period of time notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, with the agreement of each of the agents or
trustee in the case of a shorter period of time) of that request being made or fails to provide details of its credit
participation, such creditor will be disregarded and be deemed to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be
deemed to have provided the relevant confirmation or notification, as applicable, provided that the foregoing shall not

245


-----

apply to any noteholder in respect of any request where such noteholder is not given the option to respond to such
request in the negative, but shall otherwise apply to all noteholders.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following or in contemplation of an initial public offering of a member of the Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an “IPO”), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is entitled to require (by written notice to each Agent and Hedge
Counterparty) (a “Pushdown Notice”) that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically operate so that,
amongst other things, (i) the Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the member of the Group or holding
company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares are to be sold pursuant to such
IPO (the “IPO Pushdown Entity,” and if (x) any Topco Notes are not refinanced in full on or before the date of such
IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer which is the issuer
or borrower of any Topco Liabilities or (y) the Topco Notes have been refinanced in full on or before the date of such
IPO but the Senior Secured Notes have not, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity) and
its Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the
IPO Pushdown Entity and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity, and
(iii) certain provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will
cease to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is entitled to
revoke its Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event. In the event that any
Pushdown Notice is revoked each of the changes specified in (i) to (iii) (inclusive) above shall no longer apply.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security or, as the case may be, Topco Independent Transaction Security) and
each Subordinated Creditor, Third-Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement or
any other Finance Document) or Topco Independent Obligor will be released from its obligations and restrictions
under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity. In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
revokes its Pushdown Notice, the relevant member of the Group is required (if instructed by an Instructing Group) to
(x) execute replacement Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security and (y) (by way of
accession) accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as
defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of any Second Lien Notes
Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and noteholders representing more than
50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), each subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall
also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction
Security (other than, in each case, borrowing liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required
to enter into any amendment, release or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other Debt
Documents to the contrary.

**Chubb Reimbursement Agreement**

On May 28, 2021, Asda Group Limited executed a reimbursement agreement (the “Chubb Reimbursement
**Agreement”) with Chubb European Group SE (“Chubb”) in connection with deductibles payable by Asda Group**
Limited from time to time under an insurance policy provided by Chubb to Asda Group Limited with respect to
employer liability, general liability and certain motor claims. The Chubb Reimbursement Agreement was effective as
of May 1, 2021 (the “Commencement Date”) and covers losses incurred under the insurance policy from May 1,
2004, the first date of coverage, onward.

The Chubb Reimbursement Agreement required Asda Group Limited to provide, within 30 days of the
Commencement Date, security with respect to the payment of its obligations thereunder in the form, initially, of a
£30,000,000 letter of credit facility and a £19,000,000 surety bond. Chubb may require Asda Group Limited to adjust,
with 30 days’ notice, the amount of the letter of credit if Chubb determines, in its sole discretion, that such adjustment

246


-----

is necessary to secure Asda Group Limited’s outstanding obligations under the Chubb Reimbursement Agreement.
As of December 31, 2023, the liability was reduced to £34,100,000 supported by letters of credit provided by
Rabobank (£14.1 million) and RBS NatWest (£20 million) with a renewal date of June 30, 2024.

The Chubb Reimbursement Agreement has no fixed term. It can be terminated by either party upon 30 days’
notice, subject to the survival of the provisions of the agreement until all liabilities thereunder have been fully
discharged.

**NatWest Letter of Credit Facility**

In connection with its obligations under the Chubb Reimbursement Agreement, on May 20, 2021, Asda
Group Limited entered into an uncommitted letter of credit facility agreement with National Westminster Bank Plc
(“NatWest”) (the “NatWest Letter of Credit Facility Agreement”) pursuant to which NatWest issued a standby
letter of credit facility of up to an aggregate limit of £30,000,000 in favour of Chubb on behalf of Asda Group Limited
(the “NatWest Letter of Credit Facility”). In August 2023, the amount available under the NatWest Letter of Credit
Facility in favour of Chubb, on behalf of Asda Group Limited, was reduced to an aggregate limit of £20,000,000.

Asda Group Limited pays a commission on the maximum liability under the NatWest Letter of Credit Facility
at a rate of 2.20% per year (or such other rate as agreed between Asda Group Limited and NatWest from time to time).

The NatWest Letter of Credit Facility has no fixed term. Either party may cancel the NatWest Letter of Credit
Facility Agreement at any time, with 10 days’ prior notice being required should the cancellation right be exercised
by NatWest.

In connection with the NatWest Letter of Credit Facility, on May 20, 2021, Asda Group Limited provided a
counter indemnity in favour of NatWest (the “NatWest Counter Indemnity”) pursuant to which, among other things:
(i) Asda Group Limited agreed that at all times while NatWest’s commitments under the NatWest Letter of Credit
Facility remain in place, it will keep NatWest indemnified in respect of all losses, costs and liabilities that NatWest
may sustain or incur in connection with any failure by Asda Group Limited to comply with its obligations or any
non-payment under the NatWest Letter of Credit Facility; and (ii) Asda Group Limited agreed to pay NatWest on
demand any amounts due from Asda Group Limited to NatWest with, in the event that Asda Group Limited does not
maintain an account with NatWest from which NatWest can elect to debit such amounts, interest of 3.00% per year
above NatWest’s base rate from the date of demand, compounded monthly.

Should the credit rating of Asda Group Limited fall below BB- (according to Fitch) or Ba3 (according to
Moody’s), NatWest has the right to demand payment on account or cash collateral to cover all or part of the obligations
of Asda Group Limited under the NatWest Counter Indemnity. The NatWest Counter Indemnity has no fixed term.

NatWest acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Cash Management Facility Lender and the NatWest
Letter of Credit Facility was designated a Cash Management Facility under the Intercreditor Agreement on May 20,
2021. Consequently, the NatWest Letter of Credit Facility constitutes a Senior Finance Document under the
Intercreditor Agreement and is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes on the Collateral, and
NatWest qualifies as a Senior Creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement. The NatWest Letter of Credit Facility is
governed by English law.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the NatWest Letter of Credit Facility has been utilised in the
amount of £20,194,194.80.

In addition to the above, NatWest provided a separate cash pooling facility to Asda Group Limited and other
members of the Group on April 8, 2021. Such facility has a gross limit of £100,000,000 and was guaranteed by certain
members of the Group, but is otherwise unsecured.

**Rabobank Letter of Credit Facility**

On April 11, 2022, Asda Group Limited entered into an uncommitted letter of credit facility agreement with
Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A. trading as Rabobank London (“Rabobank”) (the “Rabobank Letter of Credit Facility
**Agreement”) pursuant to which Rabobank issued a standby letter of credit facility up to an aggregate limit of**

247


-----

£50,000,000 to support the liabilities of the Asda Group Limited group from time to time including with respect to
certain insurance policy deductible liabilities and certain fuel contract purchase payment obligations (or as otherwise
agreed between the Rabobank and Asda Group Limited from time to time) (the “Rabobank Letter of Credit
**Facility”).**

An issuance fee is payable by Asda Group Limited under the Rabobank Letter of Credit Facility at a rate of
1.80% per year.

The Rabobank Letter of Credit Facility has no fixed term. Either party may cancel the Rabobank Letter of
Credit Facility Agreement at any time, on no less than 5 business days’ prior notice to the other party.

In connection with the Rabobank Letter of Credit Facility, Asda Group Limited, provides Rabobank with an
indemnity against any cost, loss or liability incurred by Rabobank in acting as the issuing bank under any letter of
credit requested by (or on behalf of) Asda Group Limited.

If a change of control has occurred, the Rabobank may by written notice to Asda Group Limited (i) cancel
the Rabobank Letter of Credit Facility whereupon the Rabobank Letter of Credit Facility shall immediately be
cancelled and no longer available for further utilisation; and (ii) promptly and, in any event, within 5 business days of
the notice being received, require, at the option of Asda Group Limited either payment on account or cash collateral
in the currency and face value of any letter of credit or an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee, indemnity,
counter-indemnity or similar assurance against financial loss to be issued in respect of all amounts due under any letter
of credit and the Rabobank Letter of Credit Facility from a bank or financial institution which has a long term credit
rating BBB- (according to Fitch) or Baa3 (according to Moody’s) or by any other institution satisfactory to the
Rabobank.

Rabobank acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Cash Management Facility Lender and the Rabobank
Letter of Credit Facility was designated a Cash Management Facility under the Intercreditor Agreement on
April 11, 2022. Consequently, the Rabobank Letter of Credit Facility constitutes a Senior Finance Document under
the Intercreditor Agreement and is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes on the Collateral, and
Rabobank qualifies as a Senior Creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Rabobank Letter of Credit Facility is
governed by English law.

On October 26, 2023, an irrevocable on demand guarantee was issued at the request of Asda Stores Limited
with Esso Petroleum Company Limited as beneficiary (the “Esso Guarantee (Rabobank)”). The Esso Guarantee
(Rabobank) became effective on the date of issuance and will remain effective until one year after the date of issuance
at 5 PM Amsterdam time or such other expiry date agreed by Rabobank. The limit under the Esso Guarantee
(Rabobank) is £25,000,000. Subject to the terms of the Esso Guarantee (Rabobank), Esso Petroleum Company Limited
may request a drawing or drawings and on the second business day of receipt of a demand, Rabobank has undertaken
unconditionally and irrevocably to pay to Esso Petroleum Company Limited the amount which is demanded.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Rabobank Letter of Credit Facility is partially drawn in the
amount of £39,100,100.

**Liberty Mutual Guarantee**

On May 28, 2021, Asda Group Limited and Asda Stores Limited as indemnitors, and Liberty Mutual
Insurance Europe SE (“Liberty Mutual”) entered into a deed of indemnity (the “Deed of Indemnity”). Under the
terms of the Deed of Indemnity, Liberty Mutual agreed to consider, on an uncommitted basis, at Asda Group Limited
and Asda Stores Limited’s requests from time to time to issue a “Guarantee” (a “Liberty Mutual Guarantee”) as

instrument on behalf of a member of the Asda Group. The Deed of Indemnity contains a mechanic pursuant to which
other members of the Group may also accede as indemnitors. Liberty Mutual may, in its sole discretion, decline to
issue any such Liberty Mutual Guarantee or cancel any issued Liberty Mutual Guarantee that is cancellable in

Under the Deed of Indemnity, Asda Group Limited and Asda Stores Limited agree to indemnify Liberty
Mutual against all claims, liabilities and losses that Liberty Mutual may sustain or incur in respect of any Liberty

Liberty Mutual in funds upon demand by Liberty Mutual if a claim is made, or is reasonably likely to be made, in
respect of a Liberty Mutual Guarantee or if Liberty Mutual has paid any sum under a Liberty Mutual Guarantee.
Additionally, following a Cash Cover Event (defined to include non-payment, insolvency, breach of the Deed of
Indemnity or a document governing a Liberty Mutual Guarantee, change of control, cross default, material adverse
effect and failure to remedy non-compliance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement within 20 Business Days
of becoming aware of such non-compliance), Liberty Mutual may demand cash cover from the indemnitors. In all
cases, the indemnitors are required to provide payment within three Business Days of demand by Liberty Mutual. The
Deed of Indemnity does not have a fixed term.

Liberty Mutual acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Cash Management Facility Lender and Deed of
Indemnity was designated a Cash Management Facility under the Intercreditor Agreement with effect from June 2,
2021. Consequently, the Deed of Indemnity constitutes a Senior Finance Document under the Intercreditor Agreement
and is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes on the Collateral, and Liberty Mutual qualifies as
a Senior Creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Deed of Indemnity is governed by English law.

every loss) or aggregate limit (being, £18,602,550 or £3,702 per vehicle), the Asda Group Limited agrees to pay to
Aviva by way of reimbursement an amount equivalent to the claims payment.

The Aviva Reimbursement Agreement has no fixed term and shall continue until the date on which Aviva
issues a notice to the Asda Group Limited that Asda Group Limited’s liability to make reimbursement has been
extinguished or discharged. On expiry or cancellation of the insurance policy, the Aviva Reimbursement Agreement
shall remain in full force and effect and the parties shall continue to be liable to reimburse each other for claims
payment pursuant to the terms set out therein.

On December 18, 2023, Aviva issued a motor insurance deductible guarantee to AVIVA Insurance Limited,
t/a Aviva Global Corporate Specialty as beneficiary (the “Aviva Motor Guarantee”). The Aviva Guarantee became
effective from December 18, 2023, and will be automatically renewed annually unless cancelled or a 60 days prior
non-renewal notice has been issued. The guarantee amount under Aviva Motor Guarantee is £23,216,000.

**Supply Chain Facilities**

**_Lloyds Supply Chain Facility_**

Asda Stores Limited and Lloyds Bank Plc (“Lloyds”) entered into a buyer supply chain agreement on
November 1, 2021 (the “Lloyds Supply Chain Facility Agreement”), under which Lloyds, on an uncommitted basis,
purchase and discount invoices from selected suppliers (at a price determined in Lloyds’s sole discretion) which

250


-----

regularly supply Asda Stores Limited (or its selected affiliates) to support supply chain trading activities in an
aggregate amount of no more than £394,500,000 (the “Lloyds Supply Chain Facility”).

The Lloyds Supply Chain Facility Agreement does not have a fixed term. It may be terminated by either
Asda Stores Limited or Lloyds on not less than 60 days’ written notice (subject to a dispute resolution procedure), or
without notice where an insolvency event has occurred and is continuing in respect of Asda Stores Limited or Lloyds
(or an affiliate of Asda Stores Limited that has entered into contracts of sale under which receivables subject to the
Lloyds Supply Chain Facility arise). Additionally, Lloyds may, subject to the dispute resolution procedure, terminate
the Lloyds Supply Chain Facility where an insolvency event has occurred and is continuing in respect of a company
in the Asda Stores Limited group where Lloyds makes a commercially reasonable determination that such insolvency
is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Asda Stores Limited (or an affiliate of Asda Stores Limited
that has entered into contracts of sale under which receivables subject to the Lloyds Supply Chain Facility arise).

Asda Stores Limited provides Lloyds with an indemnity under the Lloyds Supply Chain Facility Agreement
on demand against any losses, costs, liabilities, expenses and damages incurred by Lloyds as a consequence of amongst
other things, any breach by Asda Stores Limited of its obligations under the Lloyds Supply Chain Facility Agreement.

Lloyds acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Cash Management Facility Lender and the Barclays Trade
Loan Facility was designated a Cash Management Facility under the Intercreditor Agreement on November 1, 2021.
Consequently, the Lloyds Supply Chain Facility constitutes a Senior Finance Document under the Intercreditor
Agreement and is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes on the Collateral, and Barclays qualifies
as a Senior Creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Lloyds Supply Chain Facility Agreement is governed by
English law.

As of December 31, 2023, the Lloyds Supply Chain Facility is partially drawn in the amount of £305,657,300.

**_HSBC Supply Chain Facility_**

Asda Stores Limited and HSBC Bank Plc (“HSBC”) entered into an approved invoice buyer agreement on
July 9, 2014 (as subsequently novated by HSBC Bank Plc to HSBC UK Bank Plc pursuant to a novation agreement
dated October 6, 2021, the “HSBC Supply Chain Facility Agreement”), under which HSBC Bank Plc agreed to
provide trade related facilities to Asda Stores Limited to support supply chain trading activities in an aggregate amount
of $190,000,000 (the “HSBC Supply Chain Facility”).

Pursuant to the HSBC Supply Chain Facility Agreement, HSBC provides payment administration and
management services to Asda Stores Limited for the purposes of remitting payments and settling amounts due to its
suppliers under certain trade invoices, provided that Asda Stores Limited furnishes to HSBC the requisite invoice
information specified therein.

The HSBC Supply Chain Facility Agreement does not have a fixed term. It may be terminated by either Asda
Stores Limited or HSBC on not less than 30 days’ written notice or unilaterally by HSBC should Asda Stores Limited
commit a material breach of the agreement (to the extent capable of remedy or if not remedied within 14 days) or is
dissolved, becomes insolvent or unable to pay its debts as they become due.

Asda Stores Limited provides HSBC with an indemnity under the HSBC Supply Chain Facility Agreement
on demand against any claim for any damages, losses, costs and expenses incurred by HSBC as a consequence of any
breach by Asda Stores Limited of the HSBC Supply Chain Facility Agreement or the use by Asda Stores Limited of
the agreed communications channel under such agreement.

HSBC acceded to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Cash Management Facility Lender and the HSBC Supply
Chain Facility was designated a Cash Management Facility under the Intercreditor Agreement on November 1, 2021.
Consequently, the HSBC Supply Chain Facility constitutes a Senior Finance Document under the Intercreditor
Agreement and is secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes on the Collateral, and Barclays qualifies
as a Senior Creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement. The HSBC Supply Chain Facility Agreement is governed by
English law.

As of December 31, 2023, the HSBC Supply Chain Facility is partially drawn in the amount of $131,157,392.

**_Standard Chartered Supply Chain Facility_**

Asda Stores Limited entered into a vendor prepay service programme (the “Standard Chartered Vendor
**SCF”) with Standard Chartered Bank (“SCB”) pursuant to an agreement dated February 14, 2019 (the “Standard**
**Chartered SCF Agreement”).**

Pursuant to the Standard Chartered SCF Agreement, SCB agreed to, amongst other things, accept
presentation of any invoices, transport documents or documents of title in connection with any merchandise and
services provided to Asda Stores Limited by a supplier of goods and/or services to Asda Stores Limited (and as
previously notified to SCB) (a “Selected Vendor”) from that supplier’s bank and to handle such documents in
accordance with the International Chamber of Commerce’s Uniform Rules for Collection.

The Standard Chartered SCF Agreement relates to Selected Vendors that are located and/or incorporated in
Bangladesh and is in an aggregate amount of $40,000,000.

Pursuant to the Standard Chartered SCF Agreement, Asda Stores Limited is required to determine acceptance
and notify SCB by providing copies of the requisite invoices and/or details of the relevant accounts relating to a trade
payable owing by Asda Stores Limited to a Selected Vendor (a “Trade Payable”). Upon such notification, Asda
Stores Limited is required to credit a specified account in the amount required to satisfy the relevant Trade Payable
with instructions to promptly pay the supplier of goods and/or services (subject to deduction of SCB fees).

SCB has the option to purchase a Trade Payable and, in such circumstances, shall immediately remit to the
bank of the Selected Vendor the amount required to satisfy the Trade Payable less discounting and other charges
agreed with the Selected Vendor.

If SCB otherwise decides not to purchase the Trade Payable, Asda Stores Limited will authorise SCB to debit
from the specified account the amount required to satisfy the Trade Payable on the due date, which shall constitute
the satisfaction of Asda Stores Limited’s obligations to SCB in respect of such Trade Payable.

SCB has to comply with any request of Asda Stores Limited to make payment on its behalf in respect of a
Trade Payable repurchase by a Selected Vendor and, in respect of a Trade Payable assigned to and owned by an
affiliate of SCB, to make payment on Asda Stores Limited’s behalf to such affiliate.

Pursuant to the Standard Chartered SCF Agreement, Asda Stores Limited shall indemnify SCB on demand
against any losses incurred and which arise from any breach by Asda Stores Limited of, or failure to comply with, the
terms of such agreement.

After all Asda Stores Limited’s accounts are closed the Standard Chartered SCF Agreement will no longer
be effective.

The Standard Chartered SCF Agreement does not have a fixed term. It may be terminated by either Asda
Stores Limited or SCB on not less than 30 days’ written notice or unilaterally by SCB should Asda Stores Limited
commit a breach of the agreement or become subject to any insolvency proceedings, if it is (or is likely to become)
unlawful for Asda Stores Limited or SCB to perform their respective obligations under the agreement, if complying
with the agreement causes SCB to breach any law or upon exception circumstances affecting Asda Stores Limited or
the service provided by SCB under the agreement.

The Standard Chartered Vendor SCF is unsecured and not subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.
The Standard Chartered Vendor SCF is governed by English law.

As of December 31, 2023, the Standard Chartered Vendor SCF remains partially drawn in the amount of
$22,477,536.

**Warehouse Asset Leases**

In connection with the 2021 Sale and Leaseback Transactions, the Warehouse Assets (other than the sites of
Heston and Dartford) are leased to Asda Stores Limited (the “Tenant”) by (i) Alaska Propco GP Limited; (ii) Alaska
Propco GP 2 Limited; (iii) Alaska Propco Nominee Limited; and (iv) Alaska Nominee 2 Limited, all being entities

252


-----

managed by Blackstone Group Inc. on substantially the following terms (the “Warehouse Asset Leases” and each a
“Warehouse Asset Lease”).The Warehouse Asset Leases were originally entered into between Bellis Select
Warehouse Limited and the Tenant, however, the reversionary interest in each Warehouse Asset Lease has since been
transferred to the entities listed above since the Warehouse Asset Leases were entered into in 2021.

**_Demise_**

The whole (or substantially the whole) of the landlord’s reversionary (or, as applicable, registered) interest.

**_Term_**

The term of the Warehouse Asset Leases is 25 years from and including the date of the Warehouse Asset
Leases (or, in relation to the Warehouse Asset Leases in Scotland, the date of commencement of the Warehouse Asset
Leases), which for the majority of the Warehouse Asset Lease is July 13, 2021. The Warehouse Asset Leases contain
an option to renew (or, in relation to the Warehouse Assets in Scotland extend) for a term of 10 years which can be
exercised during the term of the relevant Warehouse Asset Lease on not less than nine months’ written notice prior to
the expiry of the term of each Warehouse Asset Lease. The renewal leases (or, as applicable, extended lease) will
contain one further option to renew for a further 10 years.

**_Rent_**

The Warehouse Asset Leases each reserve a different rent payable by the Tenant in equal instalments on the
usual quarter days in each year. The Warehouse Asset Leases contain an RPI linked rent review, calculated annually
with a minimum 1% and maximum 4% uplift. On commencement of any renewal lease the passing rent will be
reviewed to the higher of the existing rent and the open market rent. Interest is payable at 3% per annum above the
Barclays base rate on any sums (including but not limited to rent) not paid by the tenant by 15 working days after the
date they are due. The Tenant is also required to pay insurance rent, utilities, service media, business rates and taxes.

**_Landlord and Tenant Act 1954_**

The Warehouse Asset Leases benefit from security of tenure under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (not
applicable for the Warehouse Asset Leases of the Scottish assets). This means that the Tenant has a right to renew the
Warehouse Asset Leases in England & Wales at the end of the term, subject to some limited grounds of opposition
available to the landlord pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954.

**_Guarantor_**

There is no guarantor party to the Warehouse Asset Leases in respect of the Tenant’s obligations.

**_Use_**

The Tenant may only use the Warehouse Assets for (1) in relation to the England & Wales leases only uses
within Class B1(b), B1(c), B2 or B8 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 and as ancillary to
such use and in relation to the Scottish leases only uses within Class 4, 5 and 6 of the Town & Country Planning (Use
Classes) (Scotland) Order 1997 (as at 31 August 2020) and as ancillary to such use; and (2) any other use approved
by the landlord (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and in relation to the England & Wales
leases only, it shall be reasonable for the landlord to withhold consent where the landlord reasonably believes that the
proposed use would result in a diminution in value of the landlord’s interest in the relevant Warehouse Asset). In
relation to the England & Wales leases only, if any alteration or change of use creates a community infrastructure
levy, the Tenant will be liable for such levy.

**_Alienation_**

The Tenant may assign (in whole only) or sublet (in whole or in part) the Warehouse Asset Leases, as set out
below.

253


-----

_Assignment_

Assignment of the whole is permitted with landlord consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed (and
where a renewal lease has been granted in relation to the Warehouse Assets Leases in England & Wales, such renewal
lease must also be assigned at the same time). The landlord may (i) withhold consent if the proposed assignee does
not have, or would reasonably be expected to have (were it rated), a rating of at least Ba3 by Moody’s or BB- by Fitch
(or a reasonably equivalent rating from a successor rating business) (the “Warehouse Rating Criteria”) and does not
provide a guarantor of the assignee’s obligations (excluding an authorised guarantee agreement) which meets the
Warehouse Rating Criteria; (ii) require both an authorised guarantee agreement and a guarantee of such authorised
guarantee agreement, where the proposed assignee has a rating below Baa3 by Moody’s, BBB by Fitch or BBB by
Standard & Poor (or a reasonably equivalent rating from a successor rating business). The landlord may also refuse
consent to assignment on any other reasonable ground or impose any other reasonable condition on its consent.

_Subletting_

The Tenant may underlet (i) the whole of a Warehouse Asset; (ii) part of a Warehouse Asset which is selfcontained and capable of separate occupation; (iii) a substation; or (iv) electric vehicle charging points, provided that
(among other conditions) there are no more than five separate and concurrent occupancies of a Warehouse Asset
(noting that (i) substations; (ii) electric vehicle charging points; (iii) any group or associated company occupying
pursuant to the permitted sharing provisions and (iv) licencees of the car park occupying pursuant to the permitted
sharing provisions shall not count as one of the five occupancies). All underleases must not benefit from the statutory
right of renewal contained in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (not applicable for the Warehouse Asset Leases of
the Scottish assets) and all undertenants must covenant directly with the landlord to (i) comply with the tenant
covenants under the relevant Warehouse Asset Lease and tenant covenants to be contained in the underlease; and to
(ii) (not applicable for Warehouse Asset Leases of the Scottish assets) apply to cancel notice of such underlease within
one month of the end of the term of the underlease. The relevant underlease must also contain specific terms, including
but not limited to: (i) the rent being not less than market value; (ii) the term not extending beyond the expiry of the
term of the relevant Warehouse Asset Lease: (iii) rent reviews being upwards only and (iv) including various
restrictions in relation to further assignment and subletting.

_Charging_

The Tenant may charge its interest in respect of the whole of each Warehouse Asset Lease only (and where
a renewal lease has been granted, such renewal lease must also be charged at the same time).

_Declarations of Trust_

In relation to the England & Wales leases only, the Tenant shall not execute any declaration of trust over the
whole or any part of its interest in the Warehouse Asset Leases.

_Group Sharing_

Sharing occupation with group companies and associated companies is permitted provided that no
relationship of landlord and tenant is created.

**_Alterations_**

The Warehouse Asset Leases permit all non-structural and many structural alterations without the need for
landlord consent. The Warehouse Asset Leases set a maximum capital expenditure for structural alterations (which
varies between the Warehouse Asset Leases), below which consent is not required, provided that the Tenant has
provided full written details of the proposed alterations and confirmation that the capital expenditure is equal to or
less than the maximum amount, and provided that the landlord has not objected in writing if it reasonably believes the
alterations might result in a diminution in the value of its interest.

There are various restrictions on all alterations to the premises, including, but not limited to, not making any
alterations which would (i) involve the demolition of the premises; (ii) lower the energy performance rating of the
premises; or (iii) involve works to the cold storage equipment (noting that not all of the Warehouse Asset Leases

254


-----

contain the restriction in relation to cold storage). The Tenant may not make alterations to service media without
landlord consent and in carrying out permitted alterations, must comply with various conditions, including (i)
obtaining any required consents; (ii) giving the insurers notice of the work; (iii) procuring that the works are carried
out in a good and workmanlike manner; (iv) making good any physical damage caused by the works; and (v) giving
the landlord access to inspect the works.

**_Repair_**

The Warehouse Asset Leases contain a repairing covenant requiring the Tenant to keep the premises in good
and substantial repair and condition, except where damage is caused by insured risks (unless insurers withhold
insurance money due to act or omission of the Tenant) or uninsured risks. The tenant is to ensure that minimum energy
performance criteria are met.

**_Yield Up_**

The Tenant is required to return the Warehouse Asset Leases at the expiry of the term having removed all
fixtures and free from any underleases, concessions and third party rights of occupation created by the Tenant other
than those where the landlord consented expressly to such occupier remaining after the expiry of the term. Alterations
are to be reinstated by the Tenant at the end of the term of the Warehouse Asset Leases unless otherwise agreed by
the landlord. The Tenant is also required to provide an exit survey and conduct a site inspection with the landlord.

**_Insurance_**

The landlord insures, save in circumstances where the original tenant (being Asda Stores Limited or a group
company) is tenant in which case the Tenant is to insure provided it has an insurance policy compliant with the terms
of the Warehouse Asset Leases, and provided the Tenant complies with the obligations relating to insurance. Where
the Tenant insures, the Tenant must insure against insured risks (which includes standard insured risk events including
fire, lightning, explosion, earthquake, landslip, heave, subsidence, riot, act of terrorism, civil commotion, aircraft
(other than hostile aircraft), storm, flood, bursting and overflowing of water tanks, apparatus or pipes, malicious
damage and such other risks reasonably required by the landlord or the Tenant) for full reinstatement cost. The
reinstatement obligations as set out below also apply to the Tenant where the Tenant insures.

Where the landlord insures, the landlord must insure against the insured risks as set out above for full
reinstatement cost and loss of rent for not less than three years. The Tenant will pay, among other costs, the insurance
rent, excesses and the amount which insurers refuse to pay following damage by an insured risk because of any act or
omission of the Tenant in breach of the Warehouse Asset Lease. The landlord is obliged to use all reasonable
endeavours to obtain any consents required to reinstate insured damage. All insurance monies will belong to the
landlord. The Warehouse Asset Leases contain rent suspension provisions (unless the tenant insures) and termination
rights which apply in certain circumstances where reinstatement of the Warehouse Assets as a result of damage caused
by insured risks has occurred and such damage has not been reinstated.

_Termination due to damage by Insured or Uninsured Risks_

The Warehouse Asset Leases contain provisions dealing with damage or destruction to the Warehouse Assets
caused by uninsured risks. The Tenant may elect to reinstate the premises, and if the Tenant does not elect to do so,
the landlord may elect to reinstate the premises. If neither party elects to do so, either party may terminate the relevant
Warehouse Asset Lease. If the premises are not reinstated within three years of a party electing to do so, either party
may elect to terminate the relevant Warehouse Asset Lease.

**_Forfeiture_**

The landlord has the right to forfeit a Warehouse Asset Lease if either (a) the rent or any other sum payable
under the Warehouse Asset Lease remains unpaid for 15 business days, (b) the Tenant materially fails to comply with
the terms of the Warehouse Asset Lease or (c) the Tenant or its guarantor suffers an insolvency event (unless, in
respect of a guarantor's insolvency event, the Tenant meets a minimum rating criteria).

255


-----

The Warehouse Asset Leases contain mortgagee protection provisions which require the landlord to provide
30 working days’ advance notice of intended forfeiture to the Tenant's mortgagee.

**_Other Material Provisions_**

There are extensive obligations on the Tenant in relation to compliance with environmental laws, providing
data to the landlord in relation to environmental performance, and taking any required remedial action at the end of
the term to return the relevant Warehouse Asset in a standard required under environmental law.

The Tenant provides an indemnity to the landlord against all loss arising from the breach of any Tenant
covenant or obligation; including costs reasonably incurred by the landlord to mitigate any such loss.

**_Warehouse Assets – Site-specific commentary_**

  - **Scotland: a kilted form of the Warehouse Asset Leases for the stores in Scotland follows largely the same**
format as the Warehouse Asset Leases for the stores in England & Wales, with the following changes:
o Statutory references have been amended to applicable Scottish law. In particular, references to the
Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 have been removed as the act is not applicable in Scotland, meaning
that the Tenant has no statutory right to renew.
o The renewal option in the England & Wales leases is amended to a lease extension option under the
Scottish leases (for the same term and on the same notice as under the England & Wales leases).
o The assignment condition is amended to remove the option for the current Tenant to provide an
authorised guarantee agreement and all other references to authorised guarantee agreement as
authorised guarantee agreements are not applicable in Scotland.

  - The underletting provisions are amended to remove requirements on the undertenant to enter into deeds of
covenant directly with the landlord. In respect of the Warehouse Asset at Grangemouth, a £1 rent lease has
also been entered into on terms substantially similar to the Warehouse Asset Leases (but excluding all
provisions in relation to insurance, rent review and environmental matters, and with bespoke (more
restrictive) provisions in relation to repair, alterations, yield up and alienation), subject to the terms of the
lease under which the aforementioned separate leasehold interest is held, to demise certain land used by this
Warehouse Asset but held as a separate leasehold interest and for the purposes of laying and retaining a
pipeline with ancillary connections for the purposes of discharging surface water from the Warehouse Asset
to the waste water network. The £1 lease is linked to the main Warehouse Asset Lease at Grangemouth
insofar as the £1 lease must only be assigned, sublet and charged simultaneously with (and to the same
assignee or sublessee as) the main Warehouse Asset Lease, and the £1 lease will terminate at the same time
as the main Warehouse Asset Lease. The Tenant under the £1 lease must pay the service charge payable
under the relevant headlease and must observe the tenant’s obligations under such headlease (other than to
pay rents) and not do anything which would put the landlord in breach of its obligations under such
headlease.

  - The Asda Group has retained ownership to the Select Retail Assets (save for in respect of the Shaw Oldham
store which was included in the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction) and the Substitute Retail Assets (save for
in respect of the Canterbury and Boldon sites which were included in the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction).

  - The Lutterworth CDC Warehouse Asset Lease contains bespoke additional obligations on the Tenant, being
(i) an obligation to pay a service charge (being such amount payable by the landlord under the superior
lease); (ii) not to apply for planning permission in relation to alterations, unless the works would not trigger
an overage under the HCA Deed (undefined), or unless the tenant has agreed to pay such overage; and (iii)
to be liable for any environmental liability in relation to a leakage of fuel from the Diesel UST tank in the
north east of the premises which was decommissioned in or about 2015.

The Lutterworth CDC, Lutterworth IDC, Washington ADC and Doncaster GM Warehouse Asset Leases
contain obligations to comply with all tenant covenants in the relevant headlease (other than to pay rents) and
additional provisions in relation to circumstances in which superior landlord consent is required. The Lutterworth IDC
Warehouse Asset Lease also contains an obligation to pay a service charge, being such amount payable by the landlord
under the superior lease.

256


-----

The Doncaster GM Warehouse Asset Lease contains a bespoke obligation on the Tenant to pay a service
charge, being such amount as the landlord is liable to pay under the superior lease on maintenance of the Redhouse
Interchange estate. The Tenant’s obligation to insure under the Doncaster GM Warehouse Asset Lease is also subject
to the superior landlord having consented to the tenant insuring.

The Wakefield ASC and CDC Warehouse Asset Leases contain bespoke provisions in relation to a right of
way in favour of the Wakefield ASC premises over the Wakefield CDC premises.

The Erith CDC and Bedford CDC Warehouse Asset Leases both contain a bespoke obligation on the Tenant
to pay a service charge (being such amount payable by the landlord under 2004 transfer documents in relation to the
Erith CDC lease and under a 2022 deed in relation to the Bedford CDC lease). The Bedford ASC Warehouse Asset
Lease contains an obligation to pay proper costs incurred by the landlord in relation to contributions under a 1997
conveyance and 2005 transfer. The Didcot ADC Warehouse Asset Lease contains an obligation on the Tenant to pay
a service charge, being such amount as the landlord is liable to pay under a 2004 transfer document.

The Warrington (Omega South) ADC Warehouse Asset Lease contains bespoke obligations on the Tenant,
being an obligation to pay any service charge under a deed entered into with the Homes and Communities Agency
(HCA) in 2013, as well as any overage which becomes due as a result of an act of the Tenant (or associated / group
company or person) under such deed. Similarly, the Washington ASC Warehouse Asset Lease contains obligations to
pay any overage which becomes due as a result of an act of the Tenant (or associated / group company or person)
under a deed entered into with the HCA in 2008. The Tenant under both aforementioned Warehouse Asset Leases is
also prevented from making any change of use or applying for planning permission for alterations which would cause
an overage to be payable under the relevant HCA deed.

The Site A Falkirk Warehouse Asset Lease contains a bespoke obligation on the Tenant to pay a service
charge, being such amount as the landlord is liable to pay under deed of condition registered in the Land Register of
Scotland under Title Number STG53196 on August 28, 2019.

The IPL Westry Warehouse Asset Lease states that no title guarantee is given in relation to one of the titles
out of which part of the IPL Westry Warehouse Asset Lease is granted (being title number CB395942, which is a
possessory freehold title). This part of the demise of the IPL Westry Warehouse Asset Lease is a small piece of
boundary land.

The Chepstow ADC Warehouse Asset Lease contains a bespoke obligation on the Tenant to pay (1) any
overage and other sums which become due (including indemnifying the landlord against the same) pursuant to a 1999
transfer; and (2) a service charge payable under transfers dated May 27, 1999.

**2023 Sale and Leaseback Facility**

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the SLB Purchase Agreement, on August 2, 2023, Asda Stores Limited, as tenant (the
“Tenant”), along with McLagan Investments Limited as Landlord entered into 22 SLB Master Leases (and
subsequently entered into the SLB Master Leases of the Kings Hill, Poole and Swindon (Haydon) properties on
(respectively) November 7, 2023, September 5, 2023 and August 21, 2023) (each a “Master Lease” and collectively,

Colchester, Doncaster, Dunbar, Farnborough, Frome, Glasshoughton, Grangemouth, Greenhithe, Kings Hill,
Leicester, Linwood, Plymouth, Poole, Robroyston, Sheffield Mosborough, Stafford, Swindon (Haydon), Totton,
Wakefield, Weston Super Mare and Wolverhampton (the “SLB Properties” and each an “SLB Property”) and
McLagan Investments Limited as Transferor subsequently transferred the reversion in each SLB Master Lease to RI
MDC UK080 Limited (“Realty”) for consideration of £645,607,637.51.

257


-----

**_SLB Purchase Agreement_**

_Post-Closing Obligations_

Following the consummation of the sale-leaseback transaction, McLagan Investments Limited must use
reasonable endeavours to resolve certain diligence items at certain of the SLB Properties. The resolution of those
diligence items included cladding issues at the Poole property, keeping Realty informed in respect of ongoing
negotiations to sell a parcel of land at or near the Doncaster property to a third party, transfer of certain shares in an
estate management company relating to the management of the Kings Hill property and dealings with a pre-emption
agreement that encumbers part of the Poole property.

**_Material SLB Master Lease Terms_**

_Term_

The initial term of the SLB Master Leases is for a term of years commencing on August 2, 2023 and expiring
on and including August 9, 2048 for the initial 22 properties (with the (inclusive) term dates for the three latercompleted properties being – Kings Hill: November 7, 2023 to November 14, 2048; Poole: September 5, 2023 to
September 12, 2048; and Swindon (Haydon): August 21, 2023 to August 29, 2048). In addition, each Master Lease
contains two (2) renewal options (or in relation to the SLB Master Leases of the Scottish assets an option to extend)
for a term of ten (10) years each which can be exercised during the term of each of the SLB Master Leases (and
subsequent first renewal or extension lease) but not less than six (6) months’ prior to expiry of the term of each of the
SLB Master Leases (and subsequent first renewal or extension lease).

_Rent_

The SLB Master Leases each reserve a different rent payable by the Tenant in equal instalments on February
28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 in each year. The rent is subject to an annual review which is upwards-only,
linked to the percentage change in Consumer Price Index for the period from the immediately preceding rent review
date to the current rent review date subject to a cap of 4% and a collar of 1%. Interest is payable at 3% per annum
above the Barclays base rate on any sums (including but not limited to rent) not paid by the Tenant on the date they
are due. The Tenant is also required to pay all outgoings (including but not limited to business rates, taxes and utilities)
and landlord fees.

_Landlord and Tenant Act 1954_

In addition to the contractual options to extend the SLB Master Leases, the SLB Master benefit from a Tenant
statutory right of renewal pursuant to the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (not applicable for the
Master Leases of the Scottish assets). The Tenant has a right to renew the SLB Master Leases in England & Wales at
the end of the term, subject to some limited grounds of opposition available to the landlord pursuant to the Landlord
and Tenant Act 1954.

_Guarantor_

There is no guarantor party to the SLB Master Leases in respect of the Tenant’s obligations.

_Use_

The Tenant may only use the SLB Properties as (1) retail stores within Class E of the Town and Country
Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (and certain specified ancillary uses to such use); (2) any use to which the SLB
Properties were used as at the date of the relevant Master Lease; and (3) any other use approved by the landlord (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed where the proposed use would not have a material adverse effect
on the value of the landlord’s interest). The Tenant may also permit undertenants to use a part of the premises for any
lawful use within Class E or various uses within Class F, provided that such uses within Class F are limited to a
maximum aggregate area of 5% of the gross internal area of the buildings on the premises.

258


-----

_Maintenance, Alterations and Expansion_

Pursuant to the SLB Master Leases, the Tenant is obligated to repair, replace and maintain each SLB
Property. The Tenant may make de minimis alterations (which include both non-structural and specific minor
structural alterations such as creation of new entrances and exterior canopies and internal division walls required for
subletting) subject to various conditions, including but not limited to (i) obtaining any planning permissions; (ii) giving
the insurers of the relevant SLB Property notice of the work; (iii) procuring that the works are carried out by reputable
contractors in a good and workmanlike manner; (iv) making good any defects arising out of the works; and (v) giving
the landlord records in line with CDM regulations and drawings of alterations).

The Tenant may make minor alterations (which include structural alterations which do not increase the gross
external area of buildings on the premises by more than 40%) subject to the above conditions, as well as subject to
supplying the landlord full written details of the proposed alterations and confirmation that such alterations are not
part of a wider scheme of works and that all requisite consents have been or will be obtained.

The Tenant may make major alterations (being any alterations or any structural additions to the properties
that are not minor alterations or de minimis alterations) subject to the conditions which apply to minor alterations as
well as subject to receiving landlord consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The Tenant must also
procure warranties in favour of the landlord (to the extent the Tenant has the ability to call for such warranties) for
major alterations or minor alterations where new buildings / extensions are erected.

There are various restrictions on all alterations to the premises, including, but not limited to, not making any
alterations which would (i) prejudice the structural integrity of the premises; (ii) lower the energy performance rating
of the premises; or (iii) have a material detrimental effect on the value of the landlord’s interest.

_Yield Up_

The Tenant is required to return the SLB Properties at the expiry of the term having removed all fixtures and
signage installed by the Tenant, as well as any alterations made during the term, except that the Tenant shall not
be required to remove buildings or permanent structures if their continued presence beyond the end of the Term
would not have a material detrimental effect on the estimated rental value of the landlord’s reversionary interest
in the relevant SLB Property or the Tenant (in its discretion) elects instead to pay a sum equivalent to the
detrimental effect on the estimated rental value of the landlord’s reversionary interest. Any alterations which have
not been completed at the end of the term must be reinstated to the landlord’s reasonable satisfaction. The Tenant
must also return the SLB Properties free from any underleases, concessions and third-party rights of occupation
created by the Tenant other than those where the landlord consented expressly to such occupier remaining after
the expiry of the term.

_Tenant’s right of First Offer_

In the event that the landlord, whether or not for money or money’s worth, wishes to sell or exchanges their
reversionary interest in any of the SLB Properties (whether in part or in whole) or grant a lease or agreement for lease
in respect of any of the SLB Properties (whether in part or in whole) at a premium or with the intention or effect of
realising capital value from any of the SLB Properties to a third party, the landlord must first offer to sell the relevant
SLB Property which is the subject matter of the proposed disposal to the Tenant, being Asda Stores Limited or any
group company (the right of first offer is personal to the original tenant and its group companies). The right of first
offer is conditioned upon there being no event of default that would give rise to a right for the landlord to forfeit the
Master Lease then occurring under the subject Master Lease.

_Assignment_

The SLB Master Leases contain assignment and subletting rights in favour the Tenant. The Tenant may
assign (in whole only) or sublet (in whole or in part) the Master Lease of the relevant SLB Property subject to landlord
consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

The landlord may impose certain conditions in respect of giving consent to an assignment. The landlord may
impose that (i) the proposed assignee enters into a deed of covenant with the landlord to comply with the terms of the

259


-----

Master Lease; (ii) there are no arrears of rents due to the landlord that are not the subject of a legitimate dispute about
their payment; and (iii) the proposed assignee either (a) where it is in a group of companies which owns or controls a
brand which is ranked as being in the top four grocery retailers in Great Britain by Kantar Group, has a financial
strength rating of at least either (A) B by Standard and Poor’s; (B) B2 by Moody’s or (C) B by Fitch (or a reasonably
equivalent rating from a successor rating business or alternative major rating agency acceptable to the landlord), or
(b) where it is not in a group of companies which owns or controls a brand in the top four grocery retailers, has a
financial strength rating of at least (A) BBB- by Standard and Poor’s; (B) Baa3 by Moody’s; or (C) BBB- by Fitch
(or a reasonably equivalent rating from a successor rating business or alternative major rating agency acceptable to
the landlord); or, in relation to both the foregoing (a) and (b), where the proposed assignee does not have such a rating,
it obtains a shadow rating from one of these agencies which would otherwise satisfy the above criteria (the “Rating
**Criteria”). Alternatively, where the Tenant or any guarantor meets the Rating Criteria, the tenant or such guarantor**
may give the landlord an authorised guarantee agreement under Section 16 of the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants)
Act 1995 guaranteeing the obligations of the proposed assignee or if the proposed assignee does not meet any of the
Rating Criteria, the proposed assignee may provide a guarantor for its obligations, such guarantor entity meeting any
of the Rating Criteria.

The landlord may withhold consent to any assignment of the Master Lease where (i) in the landlord’s
reasonable opinion, the proposed assignee (when assessed together with any proposed guarantor of the proposed
assignee other than under an authorised guarantee agreement) is not of sufficient financing standing to pay the rent
and other sums payable under the Master Lease and to company with the Tenant’s covenants in the Master Lease; (ii)
the proposed assignee or its guarantor is a company incorporated in or an individual resident in a country outside the
United Kingdom and there is no treaty for the mutual enforcement of judgements between the United Kingdom and
that country; (iii) the proposed assignee or its guarantor is a person who enjoys sovereign or state immunity, unless a
department, body or agency of the United Kingdom; or (iv) (a) the proposed assignee is a person or entity controlled
by a person designated under the OFAC, United Nations, European Union or His Majesty’s Treasury sanctions
regimes or (b) the proposed assignee is a politically exposed person (PEP), a PEP’s family member or a known close
associate of a PEP (all such terms as defined in regulation 35(1) of The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and
Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017).

_Subletting_

The Tenant may underlet the whole or any part of the relevant SLB Property provided that it obtains the prior
written consent of the landlord, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

The undertenant is to enter into a direct deed of covenant in favour of the landlord both (i) to comply with
the undertenant’s covenants in the underlease whilst it remains an undertenant; and (ii) to procure that any proposed
assignee of the underlease enters into a direct deed of covenant with the landlord on an assignment of the underlease.

Any underlease is to be granted (i) without reserving a fine or premium; (ii) at the open market rent reasonably
obtainable at the time of the grant of the underlease for the premises underlet; (iii) where the term exceeds five years,
containing provisions for the review of rent consistent with open market practice at the relevant time; and (iv)
including covenants which are not inconsistent with or impair the performance and observance of the covenants of the
Tenant in the Master Lease provided that the Tenant is able to allow the undertenant a rent free or concessionary rent
period or provide an inducement or other incentive payment to take the underlease so far as is consistent with normal
market practice.

Any underlease must not benefit from the statutory right of renewal contained in the Landlord and Tenant
Act 1954 and must be for a term which expires before the expiry of the Master Lease (not applicable for the Master
Leases of the Scottish assets).

No underlease of part of the relevant SLB Property shall permit creation of further underleases of part of the
relevant SLB Property that is underlet but may allow (i) further underleases of whole subject to obtaining the prior
consent of the landlord where it would be required to such underletting under the Master Lease (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and such further underlease shall not permit any further underletting of whole
or part of the relevant SLB Property and (ii) granting of licences or other rights to share occupation of part of areas of
the carpark or units of the store as set out under ‘Concessions’ below which do not create any relationship of landlord
and tenant.

260


-----

The Tenant may without the landlord’s consent enter into underleases of (i) any individual unit located
outside the footprint of the main store forming part of the relevant SLB Property for a term not exceeding ten years or
(ii) for automated teller machines or electrical vehicle charging points or (iii) of any individual unit located within the
footprint of the main store forming part of the relevant SLB Property for terms not exceeding ten years at a rent that
may not correspond to the passing rent under the relevant Master Lease and which may permit the undertenant to trade
in its own name or under franchise arrangements (the “Permitted Underleases”) provided that (in relation to all
Permitted Underleases): (a) the asset rating (as defined under the Energy Performance of Buildings (England and
Wales) Regulations 2012 (as amended) (Asset Rating) is not adversely affected; (b) any underlease does not benefit
from the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (not applicable for the Master Leases of the Scottish Assets); (c) any
underlease shall terminate on or before the termination of the Master Lease and shall contain a provision by which it
shall automatically terminate upon the determination (including forfeiture) of the Master Lease; (d) the terms of the
underlease are not inconsistent with, nor impair the due performance by the Tenant of its obligations in the Master
Lease and (e) unless it is granted at a rent that the landlord has confirmed is the open market rental value of the underlet
premises at the date of the grant of the underlease any such underlease must contain a statement by the Tenant and
undertenant that they are not acknowledging the rent reserved by the underlease is the open market rental value of the
underlet premises at the date of grant of the underlease (provided that where such underlease is granted pursuant to an
agreement for lease or other contractual agreement which pre-dates the date of the relevant Master Lease, the Tenant
shall use reasonable endeavours to seek the agreement of the relevant undertenant to the inclusion of such a statement).

_Concessions_

The Tenant may without the landlord’s consent grant licences or other rights to share occupation in relation
to (a) any individual unit or area of the car park located outside the footprint of the main store forming part of the
relevant SLB Property and (b) any individual unit located within the footprint of the main store forming part of the
relevant SLB Property, in both cases (i) so long as the relevant SLB Property retains the appearance of a single trading
store and (ii) the relevant SLB Property retains its asset rating under the Energy Performance of Buildings (England
and Wales) Regulations 2012 or, in relation to the Master Leases of the Scottish assets the equivalent legislation in
place in Scotland.

_Maximum Area subject to Subletting and Concessions_

The Tenant may only grant concessions of areas of the carpark or units of the store as set out under
‘Concessions’ above and/or Permitted Underleases (i) in relation to premises outside the footprint of the main store
forming part of the relevant SLB Property over an aggregate area of up to (and including) 40% in total of the aggregate
of gross external area (as measured in accordance with the Code of Measuring Practice issued by the Royal Institution
of Chartered Surveyors) of the buildings on the relevant SLB Property as at the date of the relevant Master Lease, (ii)
in relation to unbuilt upon areas of the relevant SLB Property (including landscape area and car park, if applicable)
over an aggregate area (at any one time) of up to (and including) 40% in total of the unbuilt upon areas of the relevant
SLB Property as at the date or the relevant Master Lease and (iii) in relation to premises within the footprint of the
main store forming part of the relevant SLB Property, over an aggregate area (at any one time) of up to (and including)
30% in total of the then current gross internal area (as measured in accordance with the Code of Measuring Practice
issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) of the buildings on the relevant SLB Property.

_Charging_

The Tenant may charge its interest in respect of the whole of the Master Lease to reputable lending institutions
to secure debt but cannot charge its interest in respect of only part of the Master Lease.

_Events of Default_

The SLB Master Leases contain a customary event of default (forfeiture) provision, which include: (i) failure
of the Tenant to pay the rent or any other sums due under the SLB Master Leases within 15 working days after the
due date; (ii) the Tenant breaches any of its obligations in the SLB Master Leases; (iii) the bankruptcy of the Tenant
or any guarantor, including liquidation, the appointment of an administrator or receiver, entry into a scheme of an
arrangement with creditors or is subject to a winding up order under Part IV of the Insolvency Act 1986 unless for the
purposes of a solvent amalgamation or reconstruction of the company; (iv) disclaimer of the SLB Master Leases by
the Crown or by a liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy of the Tenant; (v) the Tenant or any guarantor is struck off the

261


-----

Register of Companies; (vi) the Tenant or any guarantor ceases to exist provided that (in respect of any of (i) – (vi))
in relation to any guarantor the landlord’s right of forfeiture shall only arise (i) where the Tenant at the time of the
right arising does not meet the Rating Criteria and (ii) the Tenant fails to provide a replacement guarantor (to the
extent relevant). There are standard mortgagee protection provisions in respect of the events of default relating to nonpayment of rent and breach of tenant obligations only (and only where such breach is remediable) which oblige the
landlord to give notice to any mortgagee of the remedial actions required to remedy the relevant event of default and
allow the mortgagee 28 days to complete the remedial actions following the service of such notice.

_Insurance_

If the Tenant elects not to insure the relevant SLB Property, the landlord is obliged to insure the relevant SLB
Property demised pursuant to the relevant Master Lease against insured risks (which includes standard insured risk
events including fire, lightning, explosion, earthquake, landslip, heave, subsidence, riot, damage caused by terrorism,
civil commotion, aircraft, aerial devices, storm, flood, water, bursting and overflowing of water tanks, apparatus or
pipes, theft, impact by vehicles, malicious damage and third party liability and any other risks reasonably required by
the landlord or the Tenant) to cover full rebuilding, site clearance, VAT and three (3) years’ loss of rent. The Tenant
will pay the premium, as well as the cost of insurance valuations, excesses and the cost of rebuilding the relevant SLB
Property if insurance monies are irrecoverable due to the Tenant’s breach of the lease. The landlord is obliged to use
all reasonable but commercially prudent endeavours to obtain any consents required to reinstate insured damage. If it
is not possible to reinstate the insured damage all insurance monies will belong to the landlord.

_Termination due to damage by Insured or Uninsured Risks_

The landlord (subject to having complied with its obligations to reinstate) or Tenant may immediately
determine the relevant Master Lease if at the expiry of the three (3) year rent suspension period following destruction
or damage by an insured risk (which includes standard insured risk events including fire, lightning, explosion,
earthquake, landslip, heave, subsidence, riot, damage caused by terrorism, civil commotion, aircraft, aerial devices,
storm, flood, water, bursting and overflowing of water tanks, apparatus or pipes, theft, impact by vehicles, malicious
damage and third party liability and any other risks reasonably required by the Landlord or the Tenant) the relevant
SLB Property has not been substantially made good and remains unfit for occupation and or inaccessible by giving
notice within six (6) months of the expiry of the three (3) year rent suspension period. In respect of damage to an SLB
Property caused by uninsured damage (being damage caused by an uninsured risk) which causes the SLB Property to
be incapable of occupation and use or to be inaccessible (i) the rent will not be suspended and will remain payable by
the Tenant in accordance with the terms of the relevant Master Lease; (ii) where the uninsured damage occurs before
August 10, 2043 in the case of the initial 22 SLB Properties (or November 15, 2043 for Kings Hill, September 13,
2043 for Poole and August 30, 2043 for Swindon (Haydon)), the Tenant shall reinstate or rebuild the Premises (iii)
where the uninsured damage occurs on or after August 10, 2043 (or the relevant dates referred to in (ii) above, as
applicable) the Tenant may elect to reinstate or rebuild the SLB Property or at any point four (4) months after the date
of uninsured damage, subject to the Tenant not electing to reinstate or rebuild the SLB Property, the landlord may
elect to reinstate or rebuild the SLB Property. If the uninsured damage occurs in the last five (5) years of the term of
the SLB Master Leases and neither the landlord or Tenant have elected to rebuild or reinstate the SLB Property, the
Tenant shall ensure that the SLB Property is kept in a safe secure and tidy condition.

_Other Material Provisions_

There are extensive obligations on the Tenant in relation to compliance with environmental laws, providing
data to the landlord in relation to environmental performance, and taking any required remedial action at the end of
the term to return the relevant SLB Property in a standard required under environmental law. The landlord is not liable
for any existing contamination at the SLB Properties.

The Tenant provides an indemnity to the landlord against all loss arising from (i) the breach of any Tenant
covenant or obligation; (ii) any works carried out to the relevant SLB Property by the Tenant; (iii) any act or default
of a person in the relevant SLB Property with the express or implied consent of the Tenant; or (iv) the use of the
relevant SLB Property by the Tenant or any person authorised by the Tenant. The landlord must take reasonable steps
to mitigate any such loss, however, this is at the Tenant’s proper cost.

**_SLB Properties – site-specific provisions_**

Transaction documentation for certain of the SLB Properties differs from those master transaction document
templates which are described in the section above. This sub-section briefly sets out any such material differences on
a site-by-site basis.

  - **Blackpool: the Master Lease for the store in Blackpool contains bespoke insurance and alterations provisions**
due to certain third-party restrictive covenants registered on the title of the Blackpool store. Accordingly,
insurance is in place covering the risk of breach or enforcement of these third-party restrictive covenants. As
a consequence, if alterations or implementing or applying for planning permission would fall foul of the
exclusions within the title insurance policy, the Tenant is required to either (i) seek consent from the insurer
and confirmation from the insurer that the title insurance cover will continue notwithstanding the alteration
or implementation of planning permission, or (ii) obtain a new title insurance policy covering the same third
party restrictive covenant risks and which would not be voided by the aforementioned alterations or
application for or implementation of any planning permission. The Tenant was also required to enter into a
deed of covenant at the date of the lease to comply with various obligations contained in a 2015 transfer.
The Tenant cannot assign the Blackpool Master Lease unless the assignee enters into a deed of covenant on
the same terms.

  - **Bolton: the Master Lease for the store in Bolton contains bespoke insurance and alterations provisions due**
to the fact that several car parking spaces may encroach on land which is not owned by the landlord (which
the tenant acknowledges under the terms of the Master Lease and confirms that it will not be entitled to claim
in respect of derogation from grant in relation to such gap). Accordingly, insurance is in place covering the
risk of the owner of the relevant land claiming ownership or bringing a claim for damages. As a consequence,
if alterations or implementing or applying for planning permission would fall foul of the exclusions within
the title insurance policy, the Tenant is required to either (i) seek consent from the insurer and confirmation
from the insurer that the title insurance cover will continue notwithstanding the alteration or implementation
of planning permission, or (ii) obtain a new title insurance policy covering the same risk and which would
not be voided by the aforementioned alterations or application for or implementation of any planning
permission.

  - **Frome: McLagan Investments Limited has retained a large nature reserve at the Frome property. The Master**
Lease for the Frome property allows Asda Stores Limited or any group company (being any company or
companies which is and/or are for the time being a member of the same group of companies as the Tenant
within the meaning of Section 42(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954) to use parking at the Frome
property for visitors to the neighbouring nature reserve retained by McLagan Investments Limited.

  - **Glasshoughton: the Master Lease for the store in Glasshoughton contains bespoke insurance and alterations**
provisions due to the fact that part of the land is unregistered. Accordingly, the landlord only leases the
unregistered land with such right, title and interest as the landlord has in the premises as at the date of the
Master Lease (rather than with full title guarantee), and title insurance is in place to cover the risk of a third
party claiming ownership of the unregistered land. As a consequence, if alterations or implementing or
applying for planning permission would fall foul of the exclusions within the title insurance policy, the
Tenant is required to either (i) seek consent from the insurer and confirmation from the insurer that the title
insurance cover will continue notwithstanding the alteration or implementation of planning permission, or
(ii) obtain a new title insurance policy covering the same risk and which would not be voided by the
aforementioned alterations or application for or implementation of any planning permission.

  - **Kings Hill: the Master Lease for the store in Kings Hill contains bespoke service charge provisions due to**
the fact that there is an estate service charge payable to a third-party estate management company by the
landlord. The Tenant is required to pay any such service charge to the landlord within twenty (20) working
days of written demand. The Tenant was also required to enter into a deed of covenant at the date of the
lease to comply with various obligations contained in various transfers dated 2004 and 2013 and to create
various new restrictive covenants over the premises. The Tenant also entered into a separate deed of covenant
to pay estate charges and comply with various additional covenants. The Tenant cannot assign the Kings
Hill Master Lease unless the assignee enters into deeds of covenant on the same terms.

263


-----

  - **Leicester: the Master Lease for the store in Leicester contains an acknowledgement by the Tenant that there**
may be a gap between the north western boundary of the property and the adopted highway and that the
Tenant will not be entitled to claim in respect of derogation from grant in relation to such gap.

  - **Poole: the Master Lease for the store in Poole is an underlease and therefore contains additional obligations**
on the Tenant to comply with all tenant covenants in the headlease insofar as they relate to the Poole store
(other than to pay rents) and additional provisions in relation to circumstances in which superior landlord
consent is required. The Master Lease permits the use of certain parts of the property to be used for residential
use.

  - **Swindon Haydon: the Master Lease for the store in Swindon Haydon contains bespoke service charge**
provisions due to the fact that there is an estate service charge payable to a third-party estate management
company by the landlord (where is it not paid direct to the third party estate management company by the
Tenant). The Tenant is required to pay any such service charge to the landlord within twenty (20) working
days of written demand.

  - **Wolverhampton: the Master Lease for the store in Wolverhampton contains bespoke insurance and**
alterations provisions due to the fact that part of the land was unregistered at the time the lease was entered
into. Accordingly, insurance was put in place covering the risk of a third party claiming ownership of the
unregistered land and provisions were inserted in the lease stating that if the tenant’s alterations or
implementing or applying for planning permission would fall foul of the exclusions within the title insurance
policy, the Tenant was required to either (i) seek consent from the insurer and confirmation from the insurer
that the title insurance cover will continue notwithstanding the alteration or implementation of planning
permission, or (ii) obtain a new title insurance policy covering the same risk and which would not be voided
by the aforementioned alterations or application for or implementation of any planning permission. The
relevant land was registered at the HM Land Registry in September 2023 with title absolute and therefore
(1) the title insurance in relation to this risk ceased to apply; and (2) the site-specific provisions inserted in
the lease also ceased to apply (save in the event that there was any antecedent breach).

  - **Scotland: a kilted form of the SLB Master Leases for the stores in Scotland follows largely the same format**
as the SLB Master Leases, with the following changes:
o Statutory references have been amended to applicable Scottish law. In particular, references to the
Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 have been removed as the act is not applicable in Scotland, meaning
that the tenant has no statutory right to renew.
o The renewal option in the England & Wales leases is amended to a lease extension option under the
Scottish leases (for the same term and on the same notice as under the England & Wales leases).
o The assignment condition is amended to remove the option for the current Tenant to provide an
authorised guarantee agreement (and therefore requires the assignee to either meet the Rating
Criteria or to provide a guarantor).
o The event of default for breach of lease is amended so that if such breach is capable of remedy, the
Tenant has a reasonable period to remedy the breach following receipt of a notice from the landlord
before an event of default is triggered.
o The underletting provisions are amended to remove requirements on the undertenant to enter into
deeds of covenant directly with the landlord.
o The environmental provisions are also amended to reflect the underlying Scottish legislative regime,
and where there is title indemnity insurance benefitting the premises, the alterations provisions
prevent the Tenant applying for or implementing any planning permissions without obtaining an
endorsement amending the insured use to cover the proposed works.

**Ground Rent Transactions – Ground Rent Facility**

**_Overview and Structure_**

Asda Propco Limited (“Propco”) was incorporated to acquire 55 properties owned by Mclagan Investments
Limited. The list of properties is as follows:

264


-----

Accrington, Ashington, Barnsley, Beeston (Leeds), Boldon, Bradford West, Breck Road, Bromborough,
Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Carterton, Chatham, Cheltenham, Chorley, Clacton on Sea, Clayton Green, Corby,
Darlaston, Eastbourne, Fareham, Fleetwood, Gateshead, Golborne, Gosforth, Grimsby, Harrogate, Hartlepool,
Hereford, Huddersfield, Hull (Hessle Road), Keighley, Lancaster, Leeds Middleton, Newark, Oadby, Oldbury,
Pentym, Pilsworth, Radcliffe, Rotherham, Runcorn, Shaw Oldham, Sittingbourne, Skelmersdale, South Wooton
(Kings Lynn), Spennymoor, St Leonards on Sea, Cumbernauld (Scotland), Dalgety Bay (Scotland), Edinburgh
(Scotland), Elgin (Scotland), Forfar (Scotland), Larkhall (Scotland), Perth (Scotland), Toryglen (Scotland) (together
the “Initial CGR Properties” and together with any other properties which are acquired by Propco, the “CGR
**Properties”).**

Asda Holdco 2 Limited (“Holdco 2”) was incorporated as a holding company for Propco, and Asda Holdco
Limited (“Holdco”) was incorporated as a holding company for Holdco 2. Holdco 2’s only assets are the shares in
Propco and its interest in intercompany loans it has made to Propco. Holdco’s only assets are the shares in Holdco 2
and its interest in intercompany loans it has made to Holdco 2.

Prior to the transfer of the Initial CGR Properties to Propco, Mclagan Investments Limited entered into 99
year CGR Ground Leases (the “CGR Ground Leases” and each a “CGR Ground Lease”) in respect of the Initial
CGR Properties with Asda Stores Limited (the “Tenant”). The Initial CGR Properties were transferred from Mclagan
Investments Limited to Propco subject to and with the benefit of the CGR Ground Leases. The consideration payable
by Propco to Mclagan Investments Limited for the acquisition of the Initial CGR Properties amounted to £646,660,032
and was funded in part by third party financing of £400,000,000 from the CGR Financing Lender (the “CGR
**Financing”) with the remainder funded by subordinated debt. Propco provided all assets security for the CGR**
Financing, including but not limited to mortgages over its interests in the Initial CGR Properties, over its interest in
the CGR Ground Leases, over its insurance policies and over its bank accounts. Holdco 2 provided security over its
shares in Propco and in its intercompany debt owed to it by Propco. Propco and Holdco 2 also entered into an
agreement subordinating that intercompany debt to the indebtedness under the CGR Financing.

Propco’s only source of income is amounts received by it from the Tenant under the CGR Ground Leases.

The CGR Financing Lender’s source of funds to make the Facilities (as defined below) available was the
proceeds of notes issued to certain third-party investors on or about the date of entry into the CGR Financing (the
“CGR Notes”). Certain features of the CGR Financing reflect the responsibility of Propco for maintaining a rating in
respect of the CGR Notes and for paying costs in respect of the CGR Notes structure. Two classes of Notes were
issued: £275,000,000 of Class A CGR Notes due 2068 (the “Class A CGR Notes”) and £125,000,000 of Class B
CGR Notes due 2073.

**_The Economic Terms of the CGR Financing_**

_Facilities and Term_

The CGR Financing was utilised in full on December 20, 2023. It comprises a facility A term loan, in the
amount of £275,000,000 (“CGR **Facility A”) and a facility B term loan, in the amount of £125,000,000 (“CGR**
**Facility B,” and each of CGR Facility A and CGR Facility B a “Ground Rent** **Facility”) pursuant to the ground rent**
facility agreement (the “Ground Rent Transaction Facility Agreement”).

    - The maturity date for CGR Facility A is December 12, 2068.

    - The maturity date for CGR Facility B is December 12, 2073.

_Principal indexation and amortisation_

CGR Facility A and CGR Facility B each amortise monthly.

The outstanding principal balance of CGR Facility A and CGR Facility B (and each repayment instalment)
are subject to annual indexation in December of each year. The rate of indexation is calculated as current ‘all items’
CPI divided by the ‘all items’ CPI as at the previous annual review date. It is subject to a floor of 1x and a ceiling of

265


-----

1.04x, meaning that on each annual indexation date the principal amount and reinstalments will either stay the same
or be multiplied by a maximum 1.04 times.

Rental payments under the CGR Ground Leases are subject to indexation at the same time annually and in
accordance with the same formula such that increases in amounts due under the CGR Financing in respect of interest
and amortisation are matched by increases in rent under the CGR Ground Leases.

_Interest_

Interest is payable monthly and comprises margin and the benchmark rate. For CGR Facility A the margin is
2.8% and the benchmark rate is 0.990%. For CGR Facility B the margin is 2.944% and the benchmark rate is 1.021%.

Default interest accrues on overdue amounts at a rate that is 3% per annum higher than the rate that would
otherwise have applied.

_Fees and Make whole_

Periodic fees are paid to the agency, security agent and cash manager under the terms of the CGR Financing.

A make whole fee is payable on prepayment or cancellation of commitments. The amount of the fee is the
sum of the present value of the aggregate scheduled principal and interest payments that would have accrued and
become due and payable in respect of the amount prepaid or cancelled from the date of prepayment or cancellation up
to the relevant maturity date, discounted to the date of prepayment or cancellation at a rate equal to the reinvestment
yield for the relevant Ground Rent Facility plus 0.5%.

The ‘reinvestment yield’ is the yield to maturity implied by (a) the ask-side yields reported, as of 10.00 A.M.
(London time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date on the display designated “Page PXUK”
on Bloomberg Financial Markets (or such other display as may replace “Page PXUK” on Bloomberg Financial
Markets) for actively traded index linked gilt-edged securities having a maturity of the Discount Period; or (b) if such
yields are not reported as of such time or the yields reported are not ascertainable, the average of the ask-side yields
as determined by the index linked gilt-edged market makers (as registered with the Bank of England). Such implied
yield will be determined, if necessary, by: (i) converting quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with
accepted financial practice; and (ii) interpolating linearly between the ask-side yields for the (1) actively traded
index-linked gilt-edged security with the maturity closest to and greater than the Discount Period and (2) actively
traded index-linked gilt-edged security with the maturity closest to and less than the Discount Period. In this paragraph
the “Discount Period” is the period between the applicable prepayment/cancellation date and the applicable maturity
date.

For the purposes of the make-whole, no indexation is assumed after the date of the prepayment or cancelation
(as applicable).

The make-whole does not apply in the case of prepayment due to illegality, or note level illegality, a tax event
or a securitisation regulatory event. The make-whole also does not apply on the periodic amortisation payments.

The make-whole does apply to other mandatory prepayments, including from lease prepayment proceeds,
insurance prepayment proceeds, compensation prepayment proceeds in respect of compulsory purchase and recovery
prepayment proceeds from claims against report providers. If such amounts are received, Propco has the option to
substitute the affected CGR Property out of the CGR Financing. If the substitution occurs within six months of receipt
of the relevant payment, then the amount will not be swept in prepayment and therefore no make-whole will apply. In
addition, certain compensation proceeds, insurance proceeds and report recovery proceeds are excluded from the
mandatory prepayment requirement.

_Costs and indemnities_

Market standard cost and indemnity provisions are included under the terms of the CGR Financing, including
requirements to pay costs and increased costs relating to the CGR Financing and the CGR Notes structure. This
includes ongoing operating costs, amendment costs and enforcement and preservation costs.

266


-----

Propco is required to pay reasonably incurred costs of the finance parties in connection with substitutions
and with release of security following redemption of the CGR Notes.

Propco is required to pay the costs of valuations required under the terms of the CGR Financing, as well as
the costs of any valuation required in connection with a substitution or the release of collateral on maturity of the CGR
Notes.

_Cashflows and Reserves_

The CGR Financing requires Propco to retain bank accounts with a bank with a requisite rating. The bank
accounts are subject to security and (other than a Propco-controlled general account) are controlled by a cash manager
on behalf of the finance parties.

Net rental income and other amounts received by Propco must be paid into the bank accounts and there are
detailed provisions in the Ground Rent Transaction Facility Agreement as to the application of cash flows, including
payment of operating costs, interest, amortisation. The transaction has been modelled such that all outgoings of Propco
are intended to be funded by receipts under and in respect of the CGR Ground Leases.

_Payments waterfall_

Net rental income and certain other receipts must be paid into Propco’s rent account. A monthly cashflow
payments waterfall is run by a cash manager. This provides for payment of (1) capital receipts to be applied in
mandatory prepayment; (2) finance party and account bank costs, fees and expenses; (3) taxes and general corporate
maintenance costs of Propco, Holdco 2 or the CGR Financing Lender (subject in the case of such corporate
maintenance costs, to a cap of £250,000 per annum annually adjusted by CPI); (4) standby servicer and step-in servicer
costs, fees and expenses; (5) costs, fees and expenses due to the finance parties; (6) interest due under the CGR
Financing; (7) principal due under the CGR Financing; (8) payment of increased costs in respect of the lenders under
the CGR Financing, and increased costs in respect of the holders of the CGR Notes; (9) topping up the debt service
reserve (see below); (10) any budgeted amount required to pay ongoing operating/structural costs not already paid
above, and any costs and expenses related to a CGR Property substitution or release of collateral; (11) other amounts
due to the finance parties under the CGR Financing; and (12) any excess to Propco’s general account unless a cash
trap event is continuing in which case such surplus is transferred to the cash trap account.

It is a cash trap event if at any time the historic debt service coverage ratio is less than 1.05x on a
twelve-month lookback basis. If a cash trap event is continuing on two consecutive interest payment dates, the cash
manager is required to apply the monies in the cash trap account in prepayment of the Ground Rent Facility (together
with the make-whole (see section 4 above)). If a cash trap event is not continuing on two consecutive interest payment
dates, the cash manager shall release the monies to the Propco-controlled general account.

_Debt Service Reserve_

A 12-month reserve in respect of items (2) through (6) listed and the amount projected to be payable pursuant
to item (7) over the next 12 interest payment dates under “—Payments waterfall” must be maintained by Propco in
the debt service account at all times, or alternatively a letter of credit may be provided in an equivalent amount. The
debt service reserve is held on trust for the original lender under the CGR Financing and will not form part of Propco’s
estate in an insolvency. Any excess so reserved on any monthly interest payment date is released to Propco’s general
account (and such excess does not form part of the trust property).

_Expenses Reserve_

Propco must prepare an annual budget detailing the ongoing costs of Propco, Holdco 2, the CGR Financing
Lender and certain other costs associated with CGR Financing together with the costs associated with any scheduled
substitutions of the CGR Properties. Propco must at all times maintain a 12-month reserve in respect of any such costs
(the “Expenses Reserve Amount”).

267


-----

_Cures_

Provided the Tenant under the CGR Ground Leases is in compliance with all obligations to pay rent, Propco
is permitted to use the proceeds of subordinated debt or equity injections or free cash in the general account to make
up for any shortfalls in amounts available to make the payments under the debt service waterfall (see “Cashflows and
_Reserves—Payments waterfall”). This may be done within the period between the rental payment date under the CGR_
Ground Leases and the date falling four business days before the next monthly interest payment date. Otherwise
Propco is restricted from receiving amounts by way of subordinated debt or equity injection.

**_Representations and Undertakings under the CGR Financing_**

The CGR Financing is documented under a suite of finance documents based on Loan Market Association
and other market precedents for limited recourse real estate financing transactions. The documentation includes
provisions of a type typically included in real estate finance transactions in the European market, including but not
limited to cost and indemnity provisions in favour of the finance parties. The CGR Financing loan agreement also
includes representations and undertakings of a type seen in European real estate financing transactions. As such, there
are broad restrictions on (amongst other things) Propco incurring further indebtedness, making acquisitions and
making disposals.

Outside the substitution and release regimes (see “—Substitution mechanics under the CGR Financing” and
“—Release of CGR Properties on redemption of CGR Notes”), Propco is restricted from disposing of the CGR
Properties and acquiring properties.

Propco is subject to restrictions on taking non-ordinary course actions under the CGR Ground Leases
(including changing, amending, terminating, forfeiting of the CGR Ground Leases).

Propco and Holdco 2 are required to maintain the appointment of an independent director to their respective
boards through the term of the CGR Financing.

As is common in financings of this nature, certain undertakings and covenants of the CGR Financing require
Propco to procure that the transaction obligors take or refrain from taking certain actions. Propco does not have any
contractual, corporate or other legal ability to control the actions of the other transaction obligors and so their actions
or inactions could cause a breach without Propco having any recourse or ability to prevent it. By way of mitigation,
all of the transaction obligors are also controlled by the wider Asda group. The transaction obligors under the CGR
Financing are (as well as Propco), Asda Holdco 2 Limited, Asda Group Limited and (for so long as it is an affiliate of
Propco) Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited. Asda Group Limited and Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited are
not considered as transaction obligors in all instances, but there are nonetheless situations where Propco has
procurement obligations in their regard.

**_Trigger Event_**

On June 30 in each calendar year beginning on June 30, 2029, certain trigger events may require Propco to
deposit cash (from subordinated debt, equity injection or free cash in the general account) as additional collateral for
the CGR Financing or substitute applicable Affected Portfolio Stores (as defined below). The trigger events are: (i)
fixed charge cover ratio of less than 2.5x; (ii) the CGR Notes are rated BBB+ or lower; (iii) portfolio gearing is greater
than 30%; (iv) any stores has an average historical sales density that is in the lowers 10% of average historical sales
densities of all superstores (being any store operated by Asda Group Limited or any of its subsidiaries) which has a
net sales area of 15,000 square feet or more (“Superstores”) (“Affected Portfolio Stores”); (v) loan to value (vacant
possession) is greater than 65%; and (vi) no more than seven Affected Portfolio Stores have been substituted out.

The amount of cash required to be deposited depends on the percentage of stores operated on CGR Properties
(“Portfolio Stores”) that are Affected Portfolio Stores. It ranges from (if the Affected Portfolio Stores represent less
than 15% of such rent for all Portfolio Stores) 12 months’ of rent for all Affected Portfolio Stores for the year to June
30 (“Allocated Rent”) to double the Allocated Rent (if Affected Portfolio Stores represent 50% or more of portfolio
Allocated Rent).

268


-----

If Propco opts to substitute, it has 80 business days to do so. Otherwise, Propco has 90 business days to
deposit the cash or deliver an acceptable letter of credit.

Such cash call collateral will be released to Propco’s general account if (i) any Portfolio Store is no longer in
the lowest 15% of all average historical sales densities of all Superstores and (ii) there are no other Affected Portfolio
Stores, (or if a letter of credit has been delivered, it will be returned). The cash collateral will also be released (or the
letter of credit returned) if: (a) the relevant CGR Property is substituted out; or (b) vacant possession loan to value is
less than 65%.

**_Events of Default under the CGR Financing_**

The CGR Financing is subject to market standard events of default, subject in some cases to grace periods,
materiality qualifiers and other negotiated qualifiers in favour of Propco, certain of which are described in more detail
below. There are events of default in respect of amongst other things certain breaches of the finance documents,
misrepresentation and insolvency. The events of default triggered by compulsory purchase or major damage are
subject to the ability to substitute the effective CGR Property and therefore avoid an event of default occurring.

Certain events of default can be triggered by circumstances relating to transaction obligors under the CGR
Financing (see “—Representations and Undertakings under the CGR Financing”). It is an event of default under the
CGR Financing if ASDA Group Limited or any of its subsidiaries fails to comply with its obligations under the CGR
Financing tax deed of covenant or breaches any representation and/or warranty set out therein. Market standard events
of default are also included for (1) non-compliance of any transaction obligor with any provisions of the Finance
Documents; (2) misrepresentation by a transaction obligor; (3) cross default of any financial indebtedness of a
transaction obligor; (4) insolvency (but not of Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited); (5) insolvency proceedings
(but not of Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited), (6) creditor’s process (but not of Bellis Acquisition Company 3
Limited); (7) cessation of business (but not of Asda Group Limited or Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited); (8)
unlawfulness and invalidity; and (9) repudiation and rescission of agreements.

Events of default are included for the insolvency of the Tenant under the CGR Ground Leases, and for
persistent non-payment under or material breach of the CGR Ground Leases. In the case of the latter, such an event
of default will not arise unless a notice of intended forfeiture under s.146 Law of Property Act 1925 (or an irritancy
warning notice in respect of CGR Properties in Scotland) has been served on the Tenant and the Tenant has not
complied with such notice, and Propco has not substituted the affected CGR Property.

It is an event of default if a judgment of a court, arbitral body or agency which is reasonably likely to have a
material adverse effect is issued against Propco, Holdco 2 or the Tenant under the CGR Ground Leases.

It is an event of default if at any time Propco does not maintain the Expenses Reserve Amount. This event of
default is subject to a five business day grace period if there is a shortage of funds available in the rent account to top
up the reserve, but all amounts under the CGR Ground Leases have been paid in full.

It is an event of default if the CGR Notes are no longer rated and such failure causes the CGR Financing
Lender to cease to be a “note-issuing company” within the meaning of Regulation 5 Taxation of Securitisation
Company Regulation 2006 (SI 2006/3296). It is also an event of default if any of the CGR Notes are not rated, subject
to a carve-out where Propco is in compliance with its obligations under the CGR Financing that relate to maintaining
the rating, and a replacement rating is obtained within 90 days. No event of default arises in the event of a deterioration
in the rating of the CGR Notes.

**_Substitution mechanics under the CGR Financing_**

Propco can elect to substitute a CGR Property rather than applying capital proceeds relating to that CGR
Property in prepayment of the loans, which attracts a make whole payment.

Propco can request to substitute a CGR Property for another property at any time, subject to the satisfaction
of certain conditions including the provision of certain documentary conditions precedent. Any costs associated with
the substitution process itself and any increase in the budget resulting from the substitution must be funded in advance
into the bank accounts structure from subordinated debt or an equity injection.

269


-----

Propco can request to remove a CGR Property from the transaction perimeter for cash (in an amount equal
to the portion of the loans that corresponds to the proportion the vacant possession value of the outgoing CGR Property
bears to the overall vacant possession value of all CGR Properties, plus a make-whole amount that would apply on
the application of such amount in prepayment of the CGR Financing), subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions.
Following such removal, Propco has the ability to bring a new property into the structure within six months (subject
to satisfaction of certain documentary conditions precedent), in which case the cash is released to Propco. If no new
property is substituted in with six months, the cash is swept in prepayment of the loans and payment of the associated
make-whole.

**_Release of CGR Properties on redemption of CGR Notes_**

At any time following redemption of the Class A CGR Notes, or within six months of a mandatory
prepayment of the CGR Financing due to a redemption of the CGR Notes for taxation, illegality, change of control or
recharacterisation of the CGR Financing as a securitisation for the purposes of relevant EU Securitisation Regulation
Rules and UK Securitisation Regulation Rules, Propco may request the release of certain CGR Properties from the
CGR Financing Transaction. Any costs associated with the release process itself and any increase in the budget
resulting from the release must be funded in advance into the bank accounts structure from subordinated debt or an
equity injection. The release of the relevant CGR Properties is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions,
including the provision of certain documentary conditions precedent.

**_Pyle Asda_**

In addition to the Initial CGR Properties, it is intended that Pyle Asda (title number WA385790, address
Asda supermarket at Land to the east of Pyle Road, Pyle, CF33 6BU) will be added as an additional Property on or
before June 30, 2024.

Propco has deposited £713,462 into a lender-controlled account, and the amortisation schedule has been
amended by a commensurate amount from the original amortisation schedule. If Pyle Asda is not added to the CGR
Financing on or before June 30, 2024 with the result that the aggregate principal rent for all CGR Properties increases
by £300,000 (disregarding indexation), then the £713,462 will be swept in repayment of the financing without
attracting a make-whole and the CGR Financing will revert to the original amortisation schedule.

**_Environmental due diligence_**

On or before June 30, 2024, in respect of the CGR Properties at Harrogate and Fleetwood, Propco is required
either to (a) have engaged Delta Simmons to carry out environmental due diligence and provided evidence that such
properties are rated as less than “moderate”; or (b) to have substituted those CGR Properties (see “—Substitution
_mechanics under the CGR Financing”)._

On or before December 15, 2024, in respect of the CGR Properties at Radcliffe, Hartlepool and Barnsley,
Propco is required either to (a) have engaged Delta Simmons to carry out environmental due diligence and provided
evidence that such properties are rated as less than “moderate”; or (b) to have substituted those Properties (see “—
_Substitution mechanics under the CGR Financing”)._

In all cases, the environmental due diligence or substitution (as applicable) will be at Propco’s cost.

Propco has elected the substitute the CGR Properties referred to above and intend to acquire the following
properties from Mclagan Investments Limited: Sefton Park, Bodmin, Pyle, Dewsbury, Quedgeley, Harworth, Ayr
Resite and Bishopbriggs.

**_Tax deed of covenant_**

The CGR Financing Lender, Propco and Asda Group Limited have entered into a tax deed of covenant for
the purposes of managing certain group level tax compliance obligations. The tax deed of covenant provides for a
framework to manage, among other things, the surrender of group relief in and out of Propco, the corporate interest
restriction position for Propco as a member of the wider Asda group, the application of transfer pricing between Propco

270


-----

and other members of the wider Asda Group and the accounting consolidation of the CGR Financing Lender. The
purpose of such provisions is to ensure that the tax profile of Propco is in line with the financial model assumptions.

In addition to the management of certain group level tax compliance obligations, the tax deed of covenant
contains a tax indemnity given by Asda Group Limited to Propco to cover the imposition of unexpected tax liabilities
arising in connection with the Asda group. For example, the tax deed of covenant contains an indemnity covering the
imposition of any secondary liability taxes or the imposition of any de-grouping charge. The purpose of such tax
indemnities is to ensure that there are no unexpected liabilities which would impact the tax profile of Propco and cause
deviations from the financial model.

**_Regulatory indemnity_**

Asda Group Limited has provided an indemnity in favour of the CGR Financing Lender for any increased
costs it incurs itself, and for any liability for increased costs incurred by noteholders in each case in the event the
transaction is recharacterised as a securitisation under UK Securitisation Regulation Rules or EU Securitisation
Regulation Rules. In addition, Asda Group Limited undertakes to take such actions as are within its control to comply
with UK Securitisation Regulation Rules and EU Securitisation Regulation Rules, and to procure that Propco and any
relevant affiliate does likewise.

**_Certain definitions_**

“EU Securitisation Regulation Rules” means Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 of the European Parliament and
of the Council of 12 December 2017 laying down a general framework for securitisation and creating a specific
framework for simple, transparent and standardised securitisation, and (i) all regulatory technical standards and
implementing technical standards made pursuant thereto or otherwise applicable in relation thereto; (ii) all official
guidance published, or otherwise applicable, in relation thereto; and (iii) all related national implementing measures,
all, except as otherwise expressly stated, as amended, varied, substituted, replaced or superseded from time to time.

“UK Securitisation Regulation Rules” means Regulation (EU) 2017/2402 as it forms part of the domestic
law of the United Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended by the Securitisation
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 and (i) all technical standards made pursuant thereto or otherwise
applicable in relation thereto, and (ii) all official binding guidance published, or otherwise applicable, in relation
thereto, all, except as otherwise expressly stated, as further amended, varied or substituted from time to time.

**_CGR Ground Lease Terms_**

The CGR Ground Leases were originally entered into between McLagan Investments Limited and Asda
Stores Limited, however, the reversionary interest in each CGR Ground Lease was transferred to Asda Propco Limited
shortly after the CGR Ground Leases were entered into.

_Scotland_

A kilted form of the CGR Ground Leases for the stores in Scotland follows the same format as the CGR
Ground Leases with references to equivalent legislation (where relevant) applicable to property in Scotland.

_Term_

The initial term of the CGR Ground Leases is for a term of years commencing on December 12, 2023 to and
including December 11, 2122.

_Rent_

The CGR Ground Leases each reserve a different rent payable by the Tenant, payable in equal instalments
on the first day of each calendar month. The rent is subject to an annual review on December 1 in each year of the
term of the CGR Ground Leases which is, linked to the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for the period
from the immediately preceding rent review date to the current rent review date subject to a cap of 4% and a collar of
0%. Interest is payable at 3% per annum above the Barclays base rate on any sums (including but not limited to rent)
not paid by the tenant on the date they are due. The Tenant is also required to pay all outgoings (including but not

271


-----

limited to business rates, taxes, gas and electricity) and landlord fees. For the period of December 12, 2023 to
November 30, 2024, the aggregate rent payable under the CGR Ground Leases is £23,173,323 (and will increase
slightly following the substitution of certain CGR Properties, which is anticipated to take place on or about April 30,
2024).

_Landlord and Tenant Act 1954_

The CGR Ground Leases in England & Wales benefit from a Tenant statutory right of renewal pursuant to
the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (not applicable to the CGR Ground Leases of the Scottish assets).
The Tenant has a right to renew the CGR Ground Leases in England & Wales at the end of the term, subject to some
limited grounds of opposition available to the landlord pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954.

_Guarantor_

There is no guarantor party to the CGR Ground Leases in respect of the Tenant’s obligations.

_Use_

The Tenant may only use the CGR Ground Leases as (1) retail stores within Class E of the Town and Country
Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 and as ancillary to such use; and (2) any other use (other than specifically excluded
uses, including but not limited to manufacturing of tobacco products or weapons, any illegal or immoral purposes, or
residential use) where the Tenant has demonstrated to the reasonable satisfaction of the landlord that such use would
not materially adversely affect the landlord’s interest. The Tenant may also permit undertenants to use a part of the
premises for any use within Class E or Class F which is commonly found in supermarkets from time to time (other
than the same specifically excluded uses as above).

_Maintenance, Alterations and Expansion_

The Tenant, at its sole expense, is to keep and maintain the relevant CGR Property demised under the CGR
Ground Leases in good and substantial repair and condition. The Tenant must commission regular fire safety risk
assessments no less than every four (4) years and implement any recommendations from such reports. The Tenant
must, following service of any notice by the landlord (in respect of the Tenant’s maintenance, alterations and repair
obligations under the CGR Ground Leases) or public authority, commence any repairs to the relevant CGR Property
required by that notice within a reasonable period. If the Tenant does not comply with such notice (save for in respect
of minor repairs) and continues to fail to comply twenty (20) working days after service of a further notice by the
landlord then the landlord (upon giving the Tenant 14 days’ notice) may enter the relevant CGR Property to carry out
the repairs. The costs incurred by the landlord in carrying out such repairs are to be borne by the Tenant. The Tenant
must indemnify the landlord in respect of injury or death to any person or damage to property arising from the state
of repair and condition of the premises arising from any act, default or negligence of the Tenant in breach of the lease.

The Tenant may carry out all alterations, including major alterations (those being demolition of structures or
any structural additions to or creation of any new buildings the net effect of which either (i) increases the gross external
area and/or the gross internal area of the buildings by more than 50%; (ii) decreases the gross external area and/or the
gross internal area of the buildings by more than 50% or (iii) would involve the demolition of more than 50% of the
gross external area and/or the gross internal area of the buildings) if the Tenant (i) provides the landlord with at least
20 working days’ notice of the proposed alterations; (ii) obtains any required planning authority; (iii) carries out the
works in a good and workmanlike manner and in compliance with permissions and applicable statute; (iv) keeps and
provides access to the landlord to CDM regulation records and drawings of alterations; and (v) in the case of major
alterations, prior to commencement, demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the landlord that such major
alterations would not materially adversely affect the landlord’s interest in the relevant CGR Property and thereafter
permits the landlord to inspect progress of the works. The Tenant may not carry out any alterations which will
adversely affecting any asset rating, EPC rating or environmental performance of the relevant CGR Property or
materially adversely affect the Landlord’s interest in the relevant CGR Property.

272


-----

_Yield Up_

The Tenant is required to return the CGR Properties at the expiry of the term (1) with all additions and
improvements to the premises and all fixtures and fittings in the premises, other than the Tenant’s fixtures and fittings
which the Tenant shall be entitled to remove; and (2) free of any third party occupation or third party occupational
rights. The Tenant is not required to demolish or remove any buildings or alterations carried out in accordance with
the terms of the relevant CGR Ground Lease, nor remove any plant, machinery, lifts, flooring, etc.

_Assignment_

The CGR Ground Leases do not permit the Tenant to assign the CGR Ground Leases.

_Subletting_

The CGR Ground Leases contain broad subletting rights in favour of the Tenant. The Tenant may underlet
the whole or part of the CGR Properties (other than to an individual, company or entity that (i) manufacture tobacco
products; (ii) derives 25% or more of its revenue from the wholesale distribution of tobacco products and/or (iii)
derives 25% or more of its revenue from the retail sale of tobacco products) ((i) to (iii) inclusive being “Excluded
**Occupiers”) without landlord consent provided that: (a) any underletting is not granted for a premium; (b) any**
underletting must expire before expiry of the CGR Ground Leases; (c) any underletting is consistent with normal
market practice, including as to incentives, inducements, tenant covenants and rent review; (d) any underletting must
include covenants which are not inconsistent with or impair due performance and observance of the tenant covenants
in the CGR Ground Leases; (e) any underletting includes provisions as to forfeiture for non-payment of rent, breach
of covenant and insolvency; (f) any underletting of part must not permit the undertenant to create further underleases
of part but may allow further underleases of whole (subject to obtaining the landlord’s consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), so long as such underlease is not to an Excluded Occupier and otherwise complies with the
underletting requirements in the CGR Ground Leases; (g) any underletting of the whole of the relevant CGR Property
or store must (i) be for a term which does not exceed 25 years; (ii) not benefit from the statutory right of renewal
pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (not applicable for CGR Properties in Scotland) and (iii) be for a rent
which is the market rent reasonably obtainable at the time of the grant of the underlease and contains provisions for
the review of rent consistent with market practice at the time of the grant of the underlease; (h) if any underletting is
to a tenant group company or affiliate of the tenant then the underletting must (i) not benefit from the statutory right
of renewal pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (not applicable for CGR Properties in Scotland); (ii) contain
a break right in favour of the landlord of the underlease, exercisable if a CGR Ground Lease is terminated or otherwise
comes to an end and at the time the break right arises the tenant of the underlease is a group company or affiliate of
the Tenant of the CGR Ground Lease; (i) any underletting must not have a material adverse effect on the value of the
landlord’s interest in the relevant CGR Property; (j) any underletting must contain the same rights reserved to the
landlord in the relevant CGR Ground Lease; (k) the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease must take reasonable steps
to remedy any underlessee’s breach of terms of the CGR Ground Lease if such breach has the potential to materially
adversely affect the landlord’s interest in the premises; (l) the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease shall take
reasonable steps to enforce the performance and observance of the covenants by the undertenant contained in any
underlease; (m) the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease shall ensure that the rent payable under any underlease shall
not be reduced or paid more than one quarter in advance and (n) the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease shall ensure
that the rent under any underlease is reviewed in accordance with the terms of the underlease.

In respect of any underlease of the whole of the relevant premises or store, the Tenant under the CGR Ground
Lease must not vary or waive the terms without the CGR Ground Lease landlord’s consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) or where such variation results in the terms of the underlease being inconsistent
with the assignment and subletting provisions contained in the CGR Ground Lease or breaching the conditions for
underleases.

If a tenant under any underlease of the relevant CGR Property becomes a group company of the tenant, or if
a Tenant under an underlease of whole or any part of the relevant store becomes an affiliate of the Tenant under the
CGR Ground Lease, within 12 months, the relevant underlease must be varied to contain a landlord break right
permitting the landlord under the underlease to terminate the underlease if (i) the CGR Ground Lease is terminated or
otherwise comes to an end in any way and (ii) at the time that the break right arises the tenant of such underlease is a
group company or affiliate of the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease.

273


-----

If a tenant under an underlease of part of the relevant CGR Property that is not located within the relevant
stores becomes an affiliate of the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease, on and from such date the Tenant under the
CGR Ground Lease must use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the relevant underlease is varied to include a
landlord break right permitting the landlord under the underlease to terminate the underlease if (i) the CGR Ground
Lease is terminated or otherwise comes to an end in any way and (ii) at the time that the break right arises the tenant
of such underlease is a group company or affiliate of the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease.

_Sharing Occupation_

The Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease may permit a group company (so long as such group company is
not an Excluded Occupier) to share occupation provided that no relationship of landlord and tenant is created and such
occupation ceases as soon as the companies cease to be group companies or, if earlier, the date on which the CGR
Ground Lease expires or otherwise comes to an end.

The Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease may share occupation of part of the relevant premises with a
concessionaire, franchisee or licensee (so long as such concessionaire, franchisee or licensee is not an Excluded
Occupier) provided no relationship of landlord and tenant is created.

_Charging_

The Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease may not charge part of the relevant CGR Property. The Tenant
under the CGR Ground Lease may charge the whole of the relevant CGR Property provided that prior to such charging
the chargee has been supplied with full copies of any documents made supplemental or collateral to the CGR Ground
Lease and the Tenant shall use reasonable endeavours to procure that an acknowledgement of that is documented in
the charging document.

_Events of Default_

The CGR Ground Leases contain customary event of default and forfeiture provisions. The landlord may reenter and forfeit the CGR Ground Lease if (i) the whole or any part of the rent or any other sums due under the CGR
Ground Lease remain unpaid more than 60 days after the due date for payment or (ii) the Tenant materially fails to
perform or observe any of the Tenant’s material covenants in the CGR Ground Lease and fails to remedy the breach
within a reasonable period of time (the landlord giving the Tenant written notice of the aforesaid breach together with
details of anything necessary to be in done in order to remedy the aforesaid breach) or (iii) if (A) the Tenant is a
company or a limited partnership: (i) a meeting of the Tenant’s creditors or any of them is summoned under Part I of
the Insolvency Act 1986 and/or (ii) the Tenant enters into a compromise, scheme or arrangement or restructuring
under Part 26 or Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 or (B) if the Tenant is a partnership, it is subject to an event
similar to any listed in (A) (together with (A), a “Credit Event”) and as a consequence of any such Credit Event there
is a reduction in the rent paid or payable by the Tenant under a CGR Ground Lease (including any changes to the rent
after any rent review as contemplated by the CGR Ground Lease)– this event of default was added by way of a deed
of variation (which is not registered at HM Land Registry) dated December 20, 2023 to all of the CGR Ground Leases.

Where the Tenant has charged its interest in the CGR Ground Lease to a mortgagee and the landlord has
notice of such charge, before commencing any forfeiture proceedings in relation to the CGR Ground Lease or
exercising any right of re-entry the landlord shall give notice of the breach and details of anything necessary to be
done in order to remedy the aforesaid breach to the mortgagee and if the mortgagee confirms in writing to the landlord
within fourteen (14) days of the date of the notice that it wishes to remedy the breach, allow the mortgagee (i) in
respect of non-payment of rent or other sums due under the CGR Ground Lease, thirty (30) days; and (ii) in respect
of a breach of any condition or Tenant covenant in the CGR Ground Lease, sixty (60) days or such longer period as
be reasonable in view of the nature of the breach, to complete the remedial actions following the service of such notice.

_Insurance_

The Tenant shall insure and keep insured the relevant premises against damage or destruction by insured
risks (such risks include fire, lightning, explosion, earthquake, landslip, heave, subsidence, riot, damage caused by
terrorism, civil commotion, aircraft, aerial devices, storm, flood, water, bursting and overflowing of water tanks,
apparatus or pipes, theft, impact by vehicles, malicious damage and third party liability and any other risks reasonably

274


-----

required by the landlord or the Tenant) and such insurance shall cover the relevant premises (excluding Tenant’s
fixtures and fittings) for full reinstatement cost, as well as cover third party liability and public liability at the relevant
premises and shall comply with the obligations of the landlord (in its capacity as borrower) under the Facility
Agreement. If the Tenant does not maintain insurance pursuant to the terms of the CGR Ground Lease, the landlord
may effect the insurance (at the Tenant’s expense).

_Damage by Insured or Uninsured Risks_

The Tenant is obliged to reinstate the relevant CGR Property if the relevant CGR Property is damaged or
destroyed by an insured or uninsured risk and the Tenant must make up any shortfall of costs out of its own resources
where no or insufficient insurance monies are available. The Tenant shall procure deeds of collateral warranty from
any contractors or sub-contractors involved in completing the reinstatement works, such deeds of collateral warranty
being for the benefit of the landlord and any funder. If it is not possible for the Tenant to reinstate the relevant CGR
Property due to reasons beyond the reasonable control of the Tenant, then the Tenant shall only be obliged to keep the
relevant CGR Property in a safe condition and in compliance with any statutory requirements and shall direct the
insurer to pay to the landlord the proportion of insurance proceeds which would have been applied towards
reinstatement. At all times while the CGR Financing is subsisting, any insurance proceeds received by the Tenant or
landlord which relate to reinstatement shall be dealt with as required under the Ground Rent Transaction Facility
Agreement.

_Other Material Provisions_

There are extensive obligations on the Tenant in relation to compliance with environmental laws, providing
data to the landlord in relation to environmental performance, and taking any required remedial action at the end of
the term to return the relevant CGR Property in a standard required under environmental law. The landlord is not liable
for any existing contamination at the CGR Properties.

The Tenant provides an indemnity to the landlord against all loss arising from (i) the breach of any Tenant
covenant or obligation in the relevant CGR Ground Lease or any other agreement affecting the relevant CGR Property
(entered into by the Tenant or to which the Tenant consents); and (ii) any breach by the landlord of the superior lease
that is caused by an act or default by the Tenant.

There are no rent cessation provisions in the event of (among other causes) any damage or destruction to the
CGR Properties, any interference with the use of the CGR Properties, any default by the landlord under the CGR
Ground Leases, or any other cause whatsoever. The Tenant shall not terminate the CGR Ground Leases and waives
any right to reduce any rent or other sums payable under the CGR Ground Leases.

The Tenant acknowledges that the landlord may charge the CGR Ground Leases and that no amendment or
waiver of any provision in the CGR Ground Leases shall have effect without the mortgagee’s prior written consent.

**_CGR Properties – Site-specific provisions_**

The Shaw CGR Ground Lease includes an additional obligation on the Tenant to investigate the relevant
property to determine the extent of any Japanese knotweed present at the premises and to take action at its own cost
as necessary to treat or remove such Japanese knotweed.

(i) Clayton; (ii) Keighley; (iii) Lancaster; (iv) Pilsworth; (v) Radcliffe and (vi) St Leonards-on-Sea: these
CGR Ground Leases contain various carve outs in the provisions relating to underletting or renewal of an existing
occupational lease (which is defined by reference to the Ground Rent Transaction Facility Agreement).

(i) Chorley; (ii) Gateshead; (iii) Huddersfield; (iv) Newark and (v) Shaw: the reversionary interests in these
CGR Properties are leasehold properties therefore the CGR Ground Leases for these CGR Properties include an
obligation on the Tenant to observe and comply with the tenant obligations under the terms of the relevant headlease
and obtain superior landlord consents where necessary under the terms of the relevant headlease insofar as they relate
to the relevant store.

275


-----

**Scotland: a kilted form of the CGR Ground Leases for the stores in Scotland follows largely the same format**
as the CGR Ground Leases for the stores in England & Wales, with the following changes:

o Statutory references have been amended to applicable Scottish law. In particular, references to the
Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 have been removed as the act is not applicable in Scotland, meaning
that the tenant has no statutory right to renew.
o The mortgagee protection rights in relation to forfeiture of the lease are slightly different to reflect
applicable Scottish law.
o All references to superior leases are removed throughout the CGR Ground Leases in Scotland,
because there are no superior leases.
o The alteration provisions are amended to remove the landlord’s step in rights and to expressly
confirm that the Tenant’s obligations apply regardless of the cause of damage or destruction, even
if the cause is a latent or inherent defect again, to reflect applicable Scottish law.
o The underletting provisions are amended to remove the requirement for a landlord break right in the
event of any underleases of the whole of the premises or of the whole of the store to group or
affiliate companies.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

_You will find definitions of certain capitalised terms used in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes”_
_under the heading “—Certain Definitions.” For purposes of this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,”_
_references to (i) the “Senior Secured Notes Issuer” refer only to Bellis Acquisition Company plc and not to any of its_
_Subsidiaries and (ii) “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Bellis Acquisition Company plc and its Subsidiaries._

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue £1,750 million aggregate principal amount of      % Senior
Secured Notes due 2030 (the “Senior Secured Notes”) under an indenture (the “Senior Secured Notes Indenture”),
to be dated as of       , 2024 (the “Issue Date”), between, inter alios, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Deutsche
Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the
“Security Agent”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent (the “Paying Agent”) and as transfer agent
(the “Transfer Agent”) and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as registrar (the “Registrar”), in a private transaction
that is not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not
be qualified under, incorporate by reference or include terms of, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S.
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which £1,750 million
in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes will be issued in this Offering. We may, subject to applicable
law, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes (the “Additional Senior Secured Notes”)
of the same series or a different series as the Senior Secured Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, which shall have
substantially identical terms to the initial Senior Secured Notes, except as specifically distinguished in an Officer’s
Certificate; provided that if the Additional Senior Secured Notes are not fungible with the relevant series of Senior
Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued with a separate
ISIN code, CUSIP or Common Code, as applicable, from the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes. We will only
be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the Incurrence of
Liens (as described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” and “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens”). Except with respect to right of payment and optional redemption, and as otherwise provided_
for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes issued in this Offering and, if issued, any
Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.
Unless the context otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” references to the “Senior
Secured Notes” include the Senior Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement (as defined
below) and any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are
important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Senior Secured Notes and the Liens (as defined below) on the
Collateral (as defined below) securing the Senior Secured Notes. Please see “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement” for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

The registered Holder (as defined below) of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all
purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without
limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been,
and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

This “Description of the Senior Secured Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of
the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents (as defined below). Since
this description of the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Secured
Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are available from us upon request, and
following the Issue Date, copies of such documents will be made available upon request to holders of Senior Secured
Notes, as described in more detail under “Listing and General Information.”

-----

**General**

**_The Senior Secured Notes_**

The Senior Secured Notes will:

    - be general senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including
the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Senior Secured Notes;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s Guarantee of the Existing Senior Notes;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation (including obligations to
trade creditors) of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries that is secured by property or
assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes to the extent of the value of the property and assets
securing such Indebtedness only, including liabilities in connection with the America Ground Rent
Transaction and secured lease liabilities;

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Subsidiaries of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that are not Guarantors, including their obligations to trade creditors and
liabilities in connection with the America Ground Rent Transaction and lease liabilities; and

    - be guaranteed, on the Issue Date, on a senior basis, by the Guarantors, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and the limitations described herein and in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital
_Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be_
_subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain_
_defences that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and_
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral on a pari passu basis with all Indebtedness that is secured on an equal
and ratable basis with the Senior Secured Notes, including obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
Existing Senior Secured Notes and certain Hedging Obligations, and in priority to any Indebtedness that is secured on
a junior basis to the Senior Secured Notes, including, with respect to Shared Security, obligations under the Existing
Senior Notes; _provided, however,_ that under certain circumstances, certain Indebtedness and Hedging Obligations
may be re-designated as “super senior” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such redesignation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the obligations thereunder
have been paid in full. See “—Security—Priority,” “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

**_The Notes Guarantees_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and will
be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors, subject to the Agreed Security Principles. In addition, if required
by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees,” certain other Restricted
Subsidiaries may provide a Notes Guarantee in the future.

Each Notes Guarantee will:

    - be a general senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor, secured as set forth under “—Security”;

278


-----

    - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor
that is not subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Notes Guarantee, including that Guarantor’s
obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Senior Secured Notes;

    - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of the applicable Guarantor that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Notes Guarantee, including that Guarantor’s
Guarantee of the Existing Senior Notes;

    - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the applicable
Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes Guarantee to the extent of
the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness or obligation only, including liabilities
in connection with the America Ground Rent Transaction and secured lease liabilities;

    - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the Subsidiaries of
the applicable Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including their obligations to trade creditors, and
liabilities in connection with the America Ground Rent Transaction and lease liabilities; and

    - be subject to the limitations described herein and in “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital
_Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be_
_subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain_
_defences that may limit its validity and enforceability” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and_
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Notes Guarantees to
reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance, financial assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective
shareholders, directors and general partners, and as further stipulated in the Agreed Security Principles. For a
description of such contractual limitations, see “Certain Insolvency Considerations and _Limitations on Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.” By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor’s_
obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior
Secured Notes. See also “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our
_Indebtedness—The insolvency laws of England and Wales and other jurisdictions may not be as favourable to you as_
_the_ _U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Senior Secured Notes from recovering payments due on the_
_Senior Secured Notes.”_

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries**

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries” for purposes of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances described under “—Certain Definitions—Unrestricted
_Subsidiary,” we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.” Our_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Principal and Maturity**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue £1,750 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured
Notes on the Issue Date. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on    , 2030. The Senior Secured Notes will be
issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

**Interest**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of      % per annum. Interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will:

    - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most recently paid;

    - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on each      and     , commencing on     , 2024
_provided that the final interest payment date in respect of the Senior Secured Notes will be on      ;_

279


-----

    - be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Secured Notes on the Business Day immediately
preceding the related interest payment date (for Senior Secured Notes held in global form); and

    - be computed on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 365-day year. The interest amount will be calculated
by applying the applicable rate of interest to the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the Senior
Secured Notes.

Each interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant payment date.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Senior Secured Notes (as defined
below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes represented by one or more Global Senior Secured Note registered in the
name of or held by a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts if any, on any certificated securities, which shall be in
registered form for U.S. federal income tax purposes (“Definitive Registered Notes”) will be payable at the specified
office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest on the Definitive
Registered Notes may be paid by bank transfer to the person entitled thereto as shown on the register for the Definitive
Registered Notes. See “—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes.”

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the place at
which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the
next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result
of any such delay.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured Notes (the
“Principal Paying Agent” or “Paying Agent”). The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the “Registrar”) and a transfer agent (the
“Transfer Agent”). The initial Registrar will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. and the Transfer Agent will be
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. The Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent, as applicable, will maintain a
register reflecting ownership of the Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and, together
with the Transfer Agent, will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Definitive Registered Notes on behalf
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Senior
Secured Notes without prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and will
be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Guarantors, subject to the Agreed Security Principles. For the year ended
December 31, 2023, the Guarantors represented 98% of the Group’s consolidated revenue.

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Notes Guarantees to
reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and
general partners, and as further stipulated in the Agreed Security Principles. For a description of such contractual
limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—The

280


-----

_insolvency laws of England and Wales and other jurisdictions may not be as favourable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy_
_laws and may preclude holders of the Senior Secured Notes from recovering payments due on the Senior Secured_
_Notes,” “ Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—Each Notes_
_Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_law or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability,” and “Certain Insolvency_
_Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_ _Security Interests.”_

The operations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are and will be conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims
of creditors of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors holding debt and
guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of those
Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims
of creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes.
The Senior Secured Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including
trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
(other than such Subsidiaries that are Guarantors). Although the Senior Secured Notes Indenture limits the Incurrence
of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of
liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. See “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on_ _Indebtedness” and “—Certain Definitions—Indebtedness.”_

In addition, as described under “—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees” and subject to the
Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees any
Indebtedness Incurred under any Syndicated Term Facilities, any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate
lending commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination or any Public Debt shall also
enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favour of obligations under
the Senior Credit Facilities and the Senior Secured Notes. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the
granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal
limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalisation”
rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, where the time and cost of granting the
guarantee or security would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders or where security would be
granted over the Capital Stock, liabilities, property or other assets of any member of the Regulated Group.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or
any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise stipulated under the Agreed Security Principles,
including to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a
Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—Each Notes Guarantee and_
_security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject_
_to certain defences that_ _may limit its validity and enforceability,” “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital_
_Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—The insolvency laws of England and Wales and other jurisdictions_
_may not be as favourable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Senior Secured Notes_
_from recovering payments due on the Senior Secured Notes” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations_
_on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock
of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or
disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of the Guarantor as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary;

281


-----

(3) upon becoming a member of the Regulated Group;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or
upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(5) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and
discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities and (ii) does not guarantee
any Syndicated Term Facility or any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending
commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination or Public Debt;

(6) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including as
described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—
_Provisions Following an IPO”);_

(7) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(8) as described under “—Certain _Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees”;_

(9) as a result of a transaction permitted by “—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The
_Guarantors”; or_

(10) in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation.

Upon the request of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all
reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these
provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected
by the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, upon receipt of customary documentation under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture and without the consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the
Trustee or the Security Agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in global registered form without interest coupons, as follows:

    - Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered
form without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Senior Secured Notes”). The 144A Global
Senior Secured Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

    - Senior Secured Notes sold to non-U.S. persons outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under
the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes” and, collectively with the
144A Global Senior Secured Notes, the “Global Senior Secured **Notes”). The Regulation S Global**
Senior Secured Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee
of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions on
transfer and certification requirements summarised below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.” In
addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants in Clearstream will be

282


-----

effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and
procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes (the “144A Book-Entry Interests”) may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Senior
Secured Notes (the “Regulation S **Book-Entry Interests”) only upon delivery by the transferor of a written**
certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made
in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A
Senior Secured Notes Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with any applicable state securities laws.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon
transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Note from which it was transferred and will
become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and
after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to BookEntry Interests in the Global Senior Secured Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of £100,000
principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions
relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in
exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or as otherwise
determined by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend
with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarised below and described more fully under “Notice to Investors.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of £100,000 in principal
amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer or exchange, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other things, furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the account of the transferee at
Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in
connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder,
other than any Taxes payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the transfer
or exchange of any Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of Senior Secured Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Secured Notes to
be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date (which will
be 15 days prior to the relevant interest date for Senior Secured Notes held in definitive registered
form); or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will
be entitled to treat the Holders of Senior Secured Notes as the owners thereof for all purposes.

**Security**

**_General_**

On the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by
first-priority security interests over (a) the issued share capital of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the “Issuer Share
**Collateral”), (b) any material intercompany receivables owing to the Senior Notes Issuer by the Senior Secured Notes**
Issuer, (c) the material intra-group receivables owing to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by other member of the
Group, (d) the material bank accounts located in England and Wales of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and (e) a
floating charge over all or substantially all of the assets (other than customarily excluded assets) of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, as and when created (collectively, the “Closing Date Collateral”). Within 30 days of the Issue Date,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be further secured by first-priority interests
(i) over each Guarantor’s (a) material bank accounts, (b) the issued share capital of such Guarantors, (c) material
intercompany receivables owned to such Guarantors by other member of the Group, (d) a floating charge over all or
substantially all of the assets (other than customarily excluded assets) of each of the Guarantors and (ii) over (a) the
shares held in Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited by Project America Bidco Limited and (b) any material receivables owed
to it by Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited or its Subsidiaries from time to time, in each case, with respect to (ii) on a third
party limited recourse basis (the “Post-Closing Non-Real Estate Collateral”).

The Senior Secured Notes will be further secured within 180 days of the Issue Date, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, by security interests granted on a first-priority basis over each Guarantor’s Material Real Property
(the “Post-Closing Real Estate Collateral”, and, together with the Post-Closing Non-Real Estate Collateral, the
“Post-Closing Collateral” and, together with the Closing Date Collateral, the “Collateral”).

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall take such necessary actions and shall cause its Restricted Subsidiaries
to take such necessary actions so that, to the extent legally possible and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
Post-Closing Non-Real Estate Collateral shall be confirmed no later than the date that is 30 days after the Issue Date
and the Post-Closing Real Estate Collateral no later than the date that is 180 days after the Issue Date.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens,” the Senior Secured_
Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in connection with
future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional Senior
Secured Notes issued by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our
_Indebtedness.”_

Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture would also constitute “Collateral.” All Collateral
will be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral Liens.

As described above, all of the Collateral also secures the liabilities under the Senior Credit Facilities,
including the Revolving Credit Facility, the New Revolving Facility, the Existing Senior Secured Notes as well as
certain Hedging Obligations, and may also secure certain future indebtedness, including any Additional Senior
Secured Notes. Additionally, the Issuer Share Collateral and any material intra-group receivables owing to the Senior
Notes Issuer by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (collectively, the “Shared Security”) also secure the Senior Notes
Issuer’s obligations under the Existing Senior Notes on a second priority basis. The proceeds from the enforcement of
the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Senior Secured Notes,
with the exception of the CBRE Report described in this Offering Memorandum. By its nature, some or all of the
Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Accordingly, the Collateral may not be
able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the
_Notes Guarantees and the Collateral—The Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the Senior_
_Secured Notes.” Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, no security_
interest will be granted to secure the Senior Secured Notes in either the assets or the issued Capital Stock of any
Subsidiary that is or becomes part of our Regulated Group, and no Security Interests may be granted over any

284


-----

intercompany receivables owed by or to members of the Regulated Group to or by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Indenture, any property or asset of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, any Guarantor or any Third-Party Security Provider (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) subject only
to a floating charge (and not any other Lien) under any Security Document, to the extent such floating charge has not
crystallized into a fixed charge, shall not be deemed Collateral (including for purposes of determining whether a
Permitted Lien is permitted over such asset or property) pursuant to the covenant under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Liens,” and the granting of such Permitted Lien over such asset or property shall be deemed neither a_
breach of the covenant under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” nor a Default or an Event of
Default under the security default provision set forth in “—Certain Covenants—Events of Default.”

**_Priority_**

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the “Security Interests”) as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, (b) the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
(c) the counterparties under certain Hedging Obligations, (d) the trustee, the security agent and the holders of the
Existing Alaska Notes under the Existing Alaska Indenture, (e) the trustee, the security agent and the holders of the
Existing Connecticut Notes under the Existing Connecticut Indenture and (f) the trustee, the security agent and the
holders of the Existing Senior Notes under the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, respectively, is established by the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes
Indentures, the Security Documents and the Additional Intercreditor Agreements (if any). Such documents provide,
among other things, that under certain circumstances, including a repayment in full of the amounts outstanding under
term facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Revolving Credit Facility, the New Revolving Facility,
certain Hedging Obligations and certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super priority basis may be
re-designated as “super senior” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation,
Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the obligations under such other
Indebtedness have been paid in full. See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement”
and “—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.” In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (if any) entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure
other Indebtedness. See “—Release of Liens,” “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” and “—
_Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens.”_

In addition, the Shared Security also secures the Existing Senior Notes on a second-priority basis.

Collateral for the Senior Secured Notes may be granted by means of supplemental debentures to, and
confirmation agreements of, existing Security Documents or by means of further layers of Security Documents. As
such, in certain circumstances, the Collateral may be second-ranking and only be deemed and treated as security
interests ranking pari passu with the security interests securing the Senior Credit Facilities and the Existing Senior
Secured Notes pursuant to the application of the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. If the Intercreditor
Agreement or the relevant provisions thereof were avoided or held to be unenforceable for any reason, holders of the
Senior Secured Notes would not benefit from such first-priority treatment and be subordinated, with respect to such
security interests, to senior security interests over the same Collateral securing the Senior Credit Facilities and the
Existing Senior Secured Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees
_and the Collateral—The rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes in some of the Collateral may be adversely_
_affected by such security interests being second-ranking.”_

**Enforcement of Security Interests**

The Intercreditor Agreement restricts the ability of the Trustee or the Holders of Senior Secured Notes to
enforce the Security Interests and provides for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents
in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement. These limitations are described under “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement” and “Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests.” The ability to enforce the Security Interests may also be restricted by similar_

285


-----

arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will provide) for
circumstances in which the Holders of the Existing Senior Notes may instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement
action in respect of such Security Interests including if, among other things, a default under the Existing Senior Notes
is continuing following the expiry of an Existing Senior Notes enforcement standstill period (being a period of up to
179 days), provided that (other than in the case of an event of default which has occurred under the Existing Senior
Notes as a result of failure to pay principal at final maturity) no such enforcement action may be taken against a debtor
or any of its subsidiaries if enforcement action is being taken by the Security Agent against that debtor in respect of
Shared Security on the instructions of an instructing group which the proposed Existing Senior Notes enforcement
action might reasonably be expected to adversely affect.

**Agreed Security Principles**

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of Notes Guarantees and security in favour of
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and are substantially similar to the agreed security principles appended to
the Senior Facilities Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of Notes
Guarantees and security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal
limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, “thin
capitalisation” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, where the time and cost
of granting the guarantee or security would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders or where security
would be granted over the Capital Stock, property or other assets, or liabilities of a member of the Regulated Group.

In this “Agreed Security Principles” section only, any reference to “Acquired Person **or** **Asset,” “Agent,”**
“Debtor,” “Finance Document,” “Secured Debt Document,” or “Secured Parties” is a reference to that term as
defined in the Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date. See “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”_

**_General Principles_**

The guarantees and security required to be provided under the Secured Debt Documents will be given in
accordance with the security principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles. The description that follows
identifies the Agreed Security Principles and addresses the manner in which the Agreed Security Principles will impact
on and determine the extent and terms of the guarantees, including the Notes Guarantees, and security proposed to be
provided under or pursuant to any Secured Debt Document, including the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior
Secured Notes and the Security Documents.

(a) The Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal
and practical difficulties in obtaining effective or commercially reasonable Notes Guarantees and/or
security from all relevant members of the Group in each jurisdiction in which it has been agreed that
Notes Guarantees and security will be granted by those members. In particular:

(i) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance,
anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent
preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalisation,” “earnings
stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control
restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions,
retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar
principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a Notes Guarantee or
security or may require that the Notes Guarantee or security be limited as to amount or
otherwise and, if so, the Notes Guarantee or security will be limited accordingly, provided
that to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or
accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours
(but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third
parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such Notes Guarantee or Security
Document shall be subject to such limit;

286


-----

(ii) a key factor in determining whether or not a Notes Guarantee or security will be taken (and
in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable
time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty,
registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable legal fees) which will not be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties of obtaining such Notes
Guarantee or security;

(iii) members of the Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or enter into Security
Documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not
within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with
the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal,
regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a
material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any
member of the Group, provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before
signing any applicable Security Document or accession document, the relevant member of
the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost and without
adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or
otherwise such Notes Guarantee or Security Document shall be subject to such limit;

(iv) Notes Guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all
registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed
an amount to be agreed between the grantor of the security and the Security Agent;

(v) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of
granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such
security, security will be granted over the material assets only;

(vi) it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create
security over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over
such assets;

(vii) any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, licence, instrument, regulatory
constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third
party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured
or being subject to the applicable Security Document (including requiring a consent of any
third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if
subject to the applicable Security Document, would give a third party the right to terminate
or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of
the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially
adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded
from a Notes Guarantee or Security Document, provided that, reasonable endeavours
(exercised for a specified period of time and without incurring material cost or instigating
legal proceedings) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited)
shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security
or accession document that the asset is material and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is
satisfied that such endeavours will not involve placing relationships with third parties in
jeopardy;

(viii) the giving of a Notes Guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the
perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and
business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or
amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations,
in each case prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing), and any
requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or
not take any other action shall be subject to this clause (viii);

287


-----

(ix) any Security Document will only be required to be notarised if required by law in order for
the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence;

(x) no Notes Guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any Acquired Person
or Asset (and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are
required to support acquired indebtedness to the extent such acquired indebtedness is
permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to remain outstanding after an acquisition.
No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition not
prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be required to become a guarantor
or grant security with respect to any Secured Debt Document if prevented by the terms of
the documentation governing that acquired indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness
or any Refinancing Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any
security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in
relation thereto; no security will be granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any
permitted Indebtedness and/or to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless
specifically required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement;

(xi) to the extent possible and unless required by applicable law, there should be no action
required to be taken in relation to the Notes Guarantee or the Collateral when any Holder
assigns or transfers any of its Senior Secured Notes to a new Holder (and, unless explicitly
agreed to the contrary in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any Security Document,
no member of the Group shall bear or otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial,
registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from any
assignment or transfer by a Holder);

(xii) no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance
will be required and any security shall take subject to any matters registered against the
title to the assets as at the date of the relevant security or to which the security is otherwise
legally subject;

(xiii) security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favour of a third party
(other than in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which
do not prohibit or prevent the creation of Security Interests over such accounts) or any cash
constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded
from any relevant Security Document);

(xiv) to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favour of the Security Agent and
not the Secured Parties individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of Security
Documents for all the Secured Parties); “parallel debt” provisions will be used where
necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual Security
Documents); no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any
Notes Guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a Secured Party;

(xv) Notes Guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint
venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is
not wholly-owned by another member of the Group;

(xvi) each Security Document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction not
prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and
the security granted under each Security Document shall be deemed to be subject to these
Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant Security
Document and creation of the relevant security;

(xvii) no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement;

288


-----

(xviii) the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant
time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under
the terms of the Secured Debt Documents prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default
which is continuing;

(xix) no Notes Guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any “Excluded Swap Obligations”
defined in accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013
entitled “Swap Regulations’ Implications for Loan Documentation,” and any update
thereto by the LSTA;

(xx) other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or other
action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group;
and

(xxi) no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security
will be required to be prepared or provided to the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar
representative appointed by them at the relevant time), unless (i) required for such
documents to become effective or admissible in evidence and (ii) an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing.

(b) Notwithstanding any term of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Security Document, no Senior Secured Note, Notes Guarantee or other obligation under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document may be,
directly or indirectly:

(i) guaranteed by a “controlled foreign corporation” (as defined in Section 957(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code) that is owned by a member of the Group that is a US Person (such
entity owned by a member of the Group that is a US Person, a “CFC”) or by an entity (a
“FSHCO”) substantially all the assets of which consist of equity interests (or equity
interests and indebtedness) of one or more CFCs, or guaranteed by a subsidiary of a CFC
or FSHCO;

(ii) secured by any assets of a CFC, FSHCO or a subsidiary of a CFC or a FSHCO (including
any CFC or FSHCO equity interests held directly or indirectly by a CFC or FSHCO);

(iii) secured by a pledge or other security interest in excess of 65% of the voting equity interests
(and 100% of the non-voting equity interests) of a CFC or FSHCO; or

(iv) guaranteed by any subsidiary or secured by a pledge of or security interest in any subsidiary
or other asset, if it would result in material adverse US tax consequences as reasonably
determined by the grantor of the security or Guarantor (as applicable) and the Trustee or
any other Agent.

**_Guarantees_**

Subject to the guarantee limitations set out in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, each Notes Guarantee will
be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee for all liabilities of the Debtors under the Secured Debt
Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed Security Principles in each relevant
jurisdiction (references to “security” to be read for this purpose as including the Notes Guarantees and guarantees
provided pursuant to any other Finance Document). Security documents will secure the guarantee obligations of the
relevant security provider or, if such security is provided on a third party basis, all liabilities of the Debtors under the
Secured Debt Documents, in each case in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of these Agreed Security
Principles in each relevant jurisdiction.

289


-----

**_Governing law and scope of security_**

(a) No security or Notes Guarantees shall be required to be given by (or shares or investments in) any
joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not
wholly owned by another member of the Group.

(b) The parties agree that the overriding intention, subject to clause (a) above, is for security only to be
granted by and shall be limited to:

(i) the Senior Notes Issuer, on a limited recourse third party basis, in respect of the shares it
holds in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and all intercompany loans owed to it by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

(ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in respect of the assets described in (c), (d) and (e) of the
first paragraph under the caption “—Security—General”;

(iii) Guarantors in respect only over:

(A) their material bank accounts (without control over use) located in the United
Kingdom, any jurisdiction of incorporation of a Material Subsidiary and any
jurisdiction of incorporation of a borrower under the Senior Facilities Agreement
(each of the foregoing, a “Security Jurisdiction”);

(B) shares owned by Guarantors in other Material Subsidiaries which are Guarantors;

(C) material intercompany receivables owed to such Guarantors by other members of
the Group;

(D) their Material Real Property (by way of mortgage or, as applicable, standard
security); provided that providing any such security over Material Real Property
shall not be a requirement for any such security provider to accede to the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture as a Guarantor; and

(E) all asset floating charge security to the extent it is customary to grant such security
in the jurisdiction of incorporation of such Guarantor; and

(iv) direct Holding Companies (which are members of the Group) of Material Subsidiaries, on
a limited recourse third party basis, in respect of the shares in such Material Subsidiaries
owned by such Holding Companies,

and that no other security shall be required to be given by any other member of the Group or in
relation to any other asset unless specifically requested or agreed to by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer (in its absolute discretion) (together, the “Overriding Principle”).

(c) All security (other than share security) will be governed by the law of, and secure only assets located
in, the jurisdiction of incorporation of the applicable grantor of the security and no action in relation
to security (including any perfection step, further assurance step, filing or registration) will be
required in jurisdictions where the grantor of the security is not incorporated. Share security over
any subsidiary will be governed by the law of the place of incorporation of that subsidiary. Any
security over a structural intercompany loan granted to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be
governed by the governing law of such structural intra-group loan document.

(d) Notwithstanding any other terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement, no security or Notes Guarantees shall be required to be granted by any member of the
Group that is not incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction, other than security over shares in a Material
Subsidiary granted by a member of the Group that is not incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction.

290


-----

**_Terms of security documents_**

The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any Security Documents:

(a) security will not be enforceable or crystallise until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is
continuing;

(b) the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time)
will only be able to exercise a power of attorney following the occurrence of an Event of Default
which is continuing;

(c) the Security Documents should only operate to create security rather than to impose new commercial
obligations or repeat clauses in other Secured Debt Documents and accordingly:

(i) they should not contain additional representations, undertakings or indemnities (including,
without limitation, in respect of insurance, information, maintenance or protection of assets
or the payment of fees, costs and expenses) unless these are the same as or consistent with
those contained in the other Secured Debt Documents and are required for the creation or
perfection of security; and

(ii) nothing in any Security Document shall operate or be construed so as to prohibit any
transaction, matter or other step (or a grantor of security taking or entering into the same)
or dealing in any manner whatsoever in relation to any asset (including all rights, claims,
benefits, proceeds and documentation, and contractual counterparties in relation thereto)
the subject of (or expressed to be the subject of) the security agreement if not prohibited
by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (and
accordingly to such extent, the Security Agent shall promptly effect releases,
confirmations, consents to deal or similar steps always at the cost of the relevant grantor
of the security);

(d) no security will be granted over parts, stock, moveable plant, equipment or receivables if it would
require labelling, segregation or periodic listing or specification of such parts, stock, moveable plant,
equipment or receivables;

(e) perfection will not be required in respect of (i) vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of
title or (ii) letter of credit rights and tort claims (or the local law equivalent);

(f) in no event shall control agreements (or perfection by control or similar arrangements) be required
with respect to any assets (including deposit or securities accounts) (unless the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement expressly provide for any specific account (by reference
to its purpose) to be subject to specific restrictions on use);

(g) security will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets of the
same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental pledges or notices to be
delivered in respect of future acquired assets in order for effective security to be created over that
class of asset, such supplemental pledges or notices will be provided only upon request of the
Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Trustee or another Agent) and at intervals no more
frequent than annually (unless required more frequently under local law); and

(h) each Security Document must contain a clause which records that if there is a conflict between the
Security Document and the Finance Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement then (to the fullest
extent permitted by law) the provisions of the Finance Documents or (as applicable) the Intercreditor
Agreement will take priority over the provisions of the Security Document.

**_Bank accounts_**

(a) If a member of the Group grants security over its material bank accounts it will be free to deal,
operate and transact business in relation to those accounts (including opening and closing accounts)

291


-----

until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing (unless the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents expressly provide for any specific
account (by reference to its purpose) to be subject to specific restrictions on use). For the avoidance
of doubt (unless the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents expressly provide for any specific account (by reference to its purpose) to be subject to
specific restrictions on use), there will be no “fixed” security over bank accounts, cash or receivables
or any obligation to hold or pay cash or receivables in a particular account unless the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes have become
immediately due and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default which is
continuing.

(b) Where “fixed” security is required in accordance with paragraph (a) above, if required by local law
to perfect the security and it is possible to give such notice of security without disrupting the
operation of the account(s) in question, notice of the security will be served on the account bank in
relation to applicable accounts within 10 Business Days of the date of the Security Document (or
accession thereto) and the applicable grantor of the security will use its reasonable endeavours to
obtain an acknowledgement of that notice within 20 Business Days of service. If the grantor of the
security has used its reasonable endeavours but has not been able to obtain acknowledgement or
acceptance, its obligation to obtain acknowledgement will cease on the expiry of that 20 Business
Day period. Irrespective of whether notice of the security is required for perfection, if the service of
notice would prevent any member of the Group from using a bank account in the course of its
business, no notice of security will be served unless the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued
and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes have become immediately due and payable as a
result of the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

(c) Any security over bank accounts will be subject to any security interests in favour of the account
bank which are created either by law or in the standard terms and conditions of the account bank.
No grantor of security will be required to change its banking arrangements or standard terms and
conditions in connection with the granting of bank account security.

(d) If required under applicable local law, security over bank accounts will be registered subject to the
general principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles.

(e) No security will be provided for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee over debt service reserve

in factoring facilities, receivables discount facilities, receivables financing transactions, supply
chain finance facilities, vendor finance facilities, trade payables financing facilities, reverse
factoring facilities or any similar financings.

(a) Except as contemplated by the Overriding Principle, there shall be no requirement to grant any
security over real property in the United Kingdom. There shall be no requirement to grant security
over real property not located in the United Kingdom.

(b) There shall be no restrictions in any Security Document restricting members of the Group from
transferring, leasing or otherwise disposing of real estate assets to other members of the Group (other
than, in respect of Material Real Property which is required to comprise part of the Collateral in
accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, security granted to other members
of the Group, which shall be restricted in the manner contemplated by the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture) or any third parties and, for the avoidance of doubt, no consent or approval shall be
required under any Security Document from the Trustee or the Holders for any such transfers, leases
or dispositions and the Security Agent shall be authorised to release any security over any real estate
assets and provide such consent, approval or certificate that may be requested by any member of the

292


-----

Group in relation to such transfers, leases or dispositions without the need for any further consent
or approval from the Trustee or the Holders to the extent the relevant transfer, lease or disposition
is not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

(c) Where granting security over any real property would require obtaining consent from a third party,
there shall be no requirement to grant security (including floating security to the extent such consent
is required) over any such real property if such consent is not obtained.

(d) Where granting security over any real property would require complying with or satisfying a
restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of a third
party, the relevant member of the Group shall, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, use reasonable endeavours
(but without incurring material cost, instigating legal proceedings and without adverse impact on
relationships with third parties) to comply with or satisfy such restriction, inhibition or arrangement
following which, if the restriction, inhibition or arrangement in favour of the third party cannot be
satisfied or complied with or the third party has not provided any consent, approval, certificate or
other documentation required to register that security at HM Land Registry (or the relevant
jurisdictional equivalent), there shall be no requirement to grant security.

(e) Where granting security over any real property would require complying with or satisfying a
restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of or for
the benefit of a third party that requires the Security Agent to enter into any document pursuant to
that restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), if the Security
Agent declines to enter into such document or requests modifications to the form of any such
document (it being understood that the Security Agent is not obliged to enter into any such
documentation that is not agreed with it and the Security Agent shall not be liable to any party for
requesting modifications to the form of any such document or declining to enter into such document
(acting reasonably)), there shall be no requirement to enter into negotiations regarding that
document or to grant security over that real property.

(f) Notwithstanding that a restriction, inhibition or arrangement has been satisfied or complied with in
accordance with paragraph (d) above, if a third party has not provided any documentation or
information required for dealing with any requisition raised by HM Land Registry (or the relevant
jurisdictional equivalent) that results in an application being cancelled, then no security shall be
granted over that real property.

(g) In relation to the Material Real Properties, where there is existing security registered on the title at
HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), there shall be no requirement to apply
for the removal of such registration unless such security was granted in respect of financing obtained
from another member of the Group, ASDA Holdings UK Limited (the “Vendor”) or any Affiliate
of the Vendor or a financial institution, credit institution, insurance broker or pension fund in their
capacity as lenders.

(h) Where the Security Agent has the benefit of a restriction or inhibition (or the relevant jurisdictional
equivalent) on the title of a property, it shall provide its consent, approval, certificate or release in
the form required by HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), to allow any
matter that is not prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement as soon as possible and in any event within 10 Business Days of request by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer accompanied by a certification by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that such
matter is not prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Fixed assets_**

Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if a member of the Group grants security over its material
fixed assets it will be free to deal with those assets in the course of its business until the occurrence of an Event of
Default which is continuing. No notice, whether to third parties or by attaching a notice to the fixed assets, will be
prepared or given until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

293


-----

**_Insurance policies_**

(a) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, a member of the Group may grant security over its
material insurance policies (excluding any third party liability or public liability insurance and any
directors and officers insurance in respect of which claims thereunder may be mandatorily prepaid,
provided that the relevant insurance policy allows security to be so granted). Notice of any security
interest over insurance policies will only be served on an insurer of the Group assets upon written
request of the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Trustee or another Agent), which
may only be given after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

(b) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing, no loss payee or other
endorsement will be made on the insurance policy and no Secured Party will be named as co-insured.

**_Intellectual property_**

(a) No security will be granted over any intellectual property which cannot be secured under the terms
of the relevant licensing agreement.

(b) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if security is granted over the relevant material
intellectual property, the grantor shall be free to deal with, use, licence and otherwise commercialise
those assets in the course of its business (including allowing its intellectual property to lapse if no
longer material to its business) until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

(c) Notice of any security interest over intellectual property will only be served on a third party from
whom intellectual property is licensed upon written request of the Security Agent, which may only
be given after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. No intellectual property
security will be required to be registered under the law of that Security Document, the law where
the grantor is regulated, or at any relevant supra-national registry. Security over intellectual property
rights will be taken on an “as is, where is” basis and the Group will not be required to procure any
changes to, or corrections of filings on, external registers.

**_Receivables_**

(a) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor
grants security over any of its receivables it will be free to deal with, amend, waive or terminate
those receivables in the course of its business until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is
continuing. No notice of security may be prepared or served until the occurrence of an Event of
Default which is continuing (other than security over structural intra-group loans). Any list of
receivables provided will not include details of the underlying contracts (but may include
non-sensitive generic information to the extent that would allow for the creation of security) and
will not be required to be updated after the delivery of the first list by any Material Subsidiary. If
required under local law, security over receivables will be registered subject to the general principles
set out in these Agreed Security Principles.

**_Shares_**

(a) Security over shares, stocks or partnership interests will be limited to those over the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or a Material Subsidiary which is a Guarantor.

(b) Until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the legal title of the shares will remain
with the relevant grantor of the security (unless transfer of title on granting such security is
customary in the applicable jurisdiction) and any grantor of share security shall be permitted to
retain and to exercise voting rights and powers in relation to any shares and other related rights
charged by it and receive, own and retain all assets and proceeds in relation thereto without
restriction or condition, provided that any exercise of rights does not materially adversely affect the
validity or enforceability of the Security Interests over the shares or cause an Event of Default to
occur.

294


-----

(c) Where customary and applicable as a matter of law, on, or as soon as reasonably practicable and
after execution (and taking into account any stamping requirements in respect of any stock transfer
form (or applicable law equivalent)) of that security or accession document, the applicable share
certificate (or other documents evidencing title to the relevant shares) and a stock transfer form
executed in blank (or applicable law equivalent) will be provided to the Security Agent.

**_Regulated Group_**

(a) No member of the Group shall be required to create security over, or otherwise encumber the shares
in or assets or liabilities of (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any bank account, receivable or
any other asset of another member of the Group which corresponds to a liability of a member of the
Regulated Group), any member of the Regulated Group or any Unrestricted Subsidiary and no
member of the Regulated Group and no Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be required to become a
Guarantor.

(b) If a member of the Group is or becomes a member of the Regulated Group, the Security Agent
and/or the relevant Secured Parties (as applicable) shall, at the cost and request of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, promptly release any Collateral over the shares, assets or liabilities of (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any asset of another member of the Group which corresponds to a liability
of such member of the Regulated Group) and Notes Guarantees provided by, such member of the
Regulated Group without further consent or approval from the Trustee or the Holders.

**_Security Documents_**

(a) Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure the payment
when due of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into among, inter
alios, the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties.

(b) The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security Agent
will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of
the Senior Secured Notes. The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security
Documents and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent. As a
consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled
to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes except
through the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the
Security Agent for the Collateral. Under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the trustee under the Existing Alaska Indenture, the holders of the Existing
Alaska Notes, the trustee under the Existing Connecticut Indenture, the holders of the Existing
Connecticut Notes, the trustee under the Existing Senior Notes Indenture, the holders of the Existing
Senior Notes and the counterparties under certain hedging agreements in relation to the Security
Interests in favour of such parties.

(c) In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency,
bankruptcy or similar proceedings, the Security Interest created under the Security Documents or
the rights and obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement could be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of
the Security Interest or the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement were successful, the Holders might not be able to recover any amounts under the
Security Documents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes
_Guarantees and the Collateral” and “—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and_
_Our Indebtedness.”_

**_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that each holder of the Senior Secured Notes, by accepting
such Senior Secured Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) consented and agreed to the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance with the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” (including, without limitation, the
provisions providing for foreclosure and release of the Collateral and authorising the Security Agent
to enter into the Security Documents on its behalf) as the same may be in effect or may be amended
from time to time in accordance with its terms and authorised and directed the Security Agent to
enter into the Security Documents and to perform its obligations and exercise its rights thereunder
in accordance therewith,

(2) authorised the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, to enter into the Security Documents
and the Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby, and

(3) have appointed and authorised the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions in
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

See “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in
connection with the Incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness
permitted pursuant to the covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such
Indebtedness (or their duly authorised representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor
**Agreement”) or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on**
substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favourable to the Holders),
including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of Notes Guarantees and priority and release
of the Security Interests; _provided_ that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as
applicable, adversely affect the rights, protections, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any ambiguity,
omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of Indebtedness covered by
any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is
subject to any such agreement (including with respect to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior
Secured Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make
provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement
any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof, or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect
the Holders in any material respect. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall otherwise be entitled to direct the Trustee
or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment or waiver of any provision of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or take any action for which instructions of Holders are required under the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, with the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Senior Secured Notes), unless the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer is entitled to request such amendment, waiver or action without the consent of Holders in
accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described under “—Amendments and Waivers;”

296


-----

_provided that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any_
amendment or waiver or take any action to the extent such amendment, waiver or action does not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as
applicable, adversely affect the rights, protections, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that, in relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf of the
Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or redemption of any
obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would comply
with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide further that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured
Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the provisions
described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be
made available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our
offices or at the offices of the listing agent.

On, in contemplation of, or following, an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) provide (and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured
Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its successor shall be entitled to
require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent) that the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate
(with effect from the date specified in such notice) as described under “Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions Following an IPO.” The Trustee and the Security Agent shall_
be required to enter into any amendment to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement) or the Security Documents required by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and/or
take such other action as is required by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the
matters contemplated by this paragraph, provided that any such amendment or action will not impose any personal
obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent, or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable,
adversely affect the rights, protections, indemnifications, or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—There are circumstances_
_other than repayment or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes under which the Collateral securing the Senior Secured_
_Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will be released_
_automatically, without your consent or the consent of the Trustee.”_

**Release of Liens**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, its Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to the release
of the Security Interests in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the Security Interests in
respect of the Issuer Share Collateral) to (a) a Person that is not the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to “—Certain Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation”), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under_
“—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or is otherwise
permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary,
_provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock,_
material intellectual property, Material Real Property or loan receivables to a Restricted Subsidiary
(except to a Securitisation Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or
otherwise become subject to a Lien in favour of the Holders following such transfer, sale or disposal;

297


-----

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Guarantor;

(3) upon becoming a member of the Regulated Group, the release of the property and other assets, and

intercompany loan becoming a member of the Regulated Group, the release of any Security Interests
in any receivables under such intercompany loan;

(4) in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary following the release of its
Lien granted in favour of the Senior Facilities Agreement, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Restricted Subsidiary; provided that, there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets
of such Restricted Subsidiary that would result in the requirement for the Senior Secured Notes and
the Notes Guarantees to be secured on such property, assets or Capital Stock pursuant to the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens”;

(5) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers”;

(6) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or
upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, as provided in “—Defeasance” and “—Satisfaction and Discharge”;

(7) if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(8) upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event as described under “—Certain Covenants—Suspension
_of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status”;_

(9) in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation;

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; or

(11) in the case of any Proceeds Loan, or any other material intercompany receivables owed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries to the Senior Notes Issuer, upon its contribution
to the equity of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries following the Issue
Date.

In addition, the Security Interests created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance with
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including as described under “Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Required Consents—Provisions Following an IPO”)_
and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest.”

all necessary action reasonably required to effectuate any release of Security Interests in respect of Collateral securing
the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Document, subject to customary protections and indemnification. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected
by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee. The Trustee and the
Security Agent shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer’s Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each
certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the Collateral has occurred, and that such
release complies with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

-----

redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Senior Secured Notes at the following redemption prices (expressed as a
percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any,
to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning
on      of the years indicated below:

**Year** **Redemption Price**
2026 ............................................................................................................................... %
2027 ............................................................................................................................... %
2028, and thereafter ....................................................................................................... 100.000%

12-month period, up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes outstanding (including the
principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes outstanding), at its option, at a redemption price equal to
103.0% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Prior to     , 2026, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may, on one or more occasions, redeem up to 40% of
the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional Senior
Secured Notes), with funds in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity
Offerings at a redemption price of      % of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus

record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_Tender Offers_**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Senior Secured Notes
(including, without limitation, any Change of Control Offer and any Asset Disposition Offer), if Holders of Senior
Secured Notes of such series of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, all of
the holders of the Senior Secured Notes of such series will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer
and, accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor
more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem
the Senior Secured Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) following such
purchase at a price equal to the price (excluding any early tender fee) offered to each other Holder of Senior Secured
Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest
and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date. In determining whether the Holders
of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Secured Notes of any series have
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such Senior Secured Notes in a tender offer, Senior Secured Notes owned

299


-----

by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Affiliates or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender
offer.

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “—Selection and Notice” below.

Except for a redemption or notice pursuant to “—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,” any redemption or
notice may, at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent. If such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice may state
that, at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed or extended until such time
as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be
rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the redemption
date, or by the redemption date so delayed, in each case, as so notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the
Holders; provided that in no case (except in connection with legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or the satisfaction
and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, pursuant to the provisions described under “—Defeasance” and
“—Satisfaction and Discharge”, in which case notice may be given more than 60 days before the applicable date for
redemption) shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 days or more than 60 days prior to the date on which
such redemption (if any) occurs. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may provide in such notice that payment
of the redemption price and performance of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to such
redemption may be performed by another Person, and such notice of redemption may be extended if such conditions
precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by notice to the Holders.

If the optional redemption date is on or after a regular record date and on or before the related interest payment
date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be payable to the Person in whose name the Senior Secured Note is registered
at the close of business on such record date.

If requested in writing by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable
notice of redemption or pursuant to the applicable Officer’s Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other
entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts
deposited with the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by
the Trustee, for this purpose) to the Holders prior to the applicable redemption date, provided, however, that Holders
shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of such earlier repayment
(which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to
Holders prior to the applicable redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value
adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Senior Secured Notes are represented
by a Global Senior Secured Note deposited with a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the
beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then
applicable procedures of such clearing system.

**_Selection and Notice_**

If less than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar
(as applicable) will select Senior Secured Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Senior Secured
Notes issued as Global Senior Secured Notes, based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection
(such as by way of pool factor) in accordance with the then applicable procedures of the relevant clearing system),
unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange, clearing system or depositary requirements; provided,
_however,_ that no Senior Secured Note of £100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and
only Senior Secured Notes in integral multiples of £1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent
nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior
Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive
Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any
Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the
original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Senior Secured Note, redemption will be effected in

300


-----

accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system (including by application of a pool factor) or an
appropriate notation will be made on such Global Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an
amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior
Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date,
unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on
Senior Secured Notes or portions of Senior Secured Notes called for redemption.

**_Sinking Fund_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund
payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Redemption at Maturity_**

On     , 2030, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will redeem the Senior Secured Notes that have not been
previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

**_Redemption for Taxation Reasons_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem any series of Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part,
at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice to the Holders of the relevant series of
Senior Secured Notes (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax
**Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on**
the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined under “—Withholding Taxes”), if any, then
due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date, as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined under “—Withholding
_Taxes”) affecting taxation; or_

(2) any amendment to, introduction of, or change in an official application or interpretation of such
laws, treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of
competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice),

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”), a Payor (as defined under “—Withholding
_Taxes”) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes would be,_
required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such series of Senior Secured Notes or the Notes Guarantee, as
applicable (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts) and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable);
_provided that changing the jurisdiction of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not a reasonable measure for purposes of_
this section. Such Change in Tax Law must be announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the
applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such
later date).

The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person
becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time
such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under “—Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier
than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional

301


-----

Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in
effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any series of Senior Secured Notes pursuant
to the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that it
is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its
right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognised standing to the
effect that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result
of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion
as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further
inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**_Open Market Purchases, Privately Negotiated Transactions, Tender Offers_**

As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Permitted Holders, their respective
Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities
or loans, including the Senior Secured Notes or derivative instruments related thereto, in privately negotiated or open
market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements
governing our Indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded
by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings
under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate,
may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of
debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a “Payor”)
in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and
clear of, and without withholding or deduction for or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or deduction of
such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes imposed or levied
by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note is made by or on
behalf of a Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having
the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organised, engaged in business for tax purposes, or
otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clause (1) and (2), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”), will at any time be required by law to be made from
any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with respect to any Senior Secured Note, including payments of
principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such
additional amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each
Holder in respect of such payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding
from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by such Holder
in respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note in the absence of such withholding or deduction;
_provided, however,_ that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes would not have been so imposed but for the existence of
any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of the Senior
Secured Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust,
partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
(including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or
national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being
physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction), but excluding, in each case, any connection
arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note or the receipt

302


-----

of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the
Holder or the beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a written request of the
Payor (or its agent) addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such
withholding or deduction would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or
other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial
owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating
to such matters, which is required by law, statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of
deduction or withholding of, all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial
owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes are imposed as a result of the presentation of the Senior
Secured Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the date the
relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder, except to the extent the relevant
Holder would have been entitled to an Additional Amount on presenting the same for payment on
such thirtieth day assuming that day to have been a relevant payment date;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by deduction or withholding from a payment under or
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes or any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar Tax, assessment or
other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Secured Note presented for payment by or on behalf
of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the
relevant Senior Secured Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent
(where there is such a Paying Agent);

(7) any Taxes that are imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) as of the Issue Date, or any amended
or successor version of such sections that are substantively comparable, any current or future
regulations promulgated thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, any similar law or
regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and
the United States with respect to the foregoing (or any treaty, law or regulation implementing such
an intergovernmental agreement) or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of
the Code; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership
or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or
settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been
entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured
Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from
each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding
the Payor’s reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not obtained, certified copies of other
reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Such
copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying
Agent.

303


-----

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver
to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable
and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay
Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises
less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as
promptly as practicable after the date that is 30 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent
shall be entitled to rely solely, without further inquiry, on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such
payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this “Description of the _Senior_
_Secured Notes” there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) redemption prices or purchase_
prices in connection with a redemption of Senior Secured Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or
with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Notes Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include
payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable
in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay (and will indemnify the Holder for) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court
or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties) or any other excise,
property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties) that arise in a Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, delivery or registration of any Senior Secured Notes, any Notes Guarantee,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case,
in connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after this Offering) or the receipt of any payments with
respect thereto or any such taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest or penalties) imposed by
any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes or any Notes
Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of any such taxes or similar charges or levies attributable to the receipt of any
payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under
clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (7) above or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, including any transfer by a Holder or beneficial owner of its Senior Secured Notes, and will apply mutatis
_mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organised, engaged in business for tax purposes or_
otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which any payment under, or with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes is made by or on behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or
agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party
makes a change of control offer as described below or (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has previously or
substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make an offer to purchase
all of the Senior Secured Notes (provided that Senior Secured Notes of £100,000 or less may only be tendered and
repurchased in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of Control Offer”), at a
price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional
Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase (the “Change of Control Payment”); provided that if the
repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders
in whose name the Senior Secured Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest
on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver
or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address
of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change
of Control and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified
in the notice (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than
the later of (x) 60 days from the date such notice is delivered and (y) the date of completion of the Change of Control,
pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except, in
the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control, as described below.

304


-----

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate
stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured
Notes being purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Senior Secured Notes, unless notation of the purchase of Senior Secured Notes
is to be effected in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system, deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent the Global Senior Secured Notes, in order to reflect
thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and
purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar
for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of
Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the
Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, promptly authenticate and
mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive
Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any;
_provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount that is at least £100,000 and integral_
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the
Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalisation or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s
right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence
of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its
Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change
of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not
withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes
has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless
and until there is a default in the payment of the applicable redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the
redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption
notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in
advance of a Change of Control; _provided, however,_ that such Change of Control Offer is conditional upon such
Change of Control.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e)
of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to this covenant. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC
indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain
conditions. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and

305


-----

regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to a
Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of events that constitute a Change of
Control would result in Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement becoming immediately due and payable
or subject to a mandatory prepayment and in an obligation to repurchase notes at the option of holders of the Existing
Senior Notes under the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Existing Senior Secured Notes under the Existing
Senior Secured Notes Indentures. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also
contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be
repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of,
such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a
repurchase may be limited by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no
assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—The Group may not have_
_the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence_
_of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.” The definition_
of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited
body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase
“substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty
as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “substantially all” of the property or assets of a
Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may
require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligation
to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified
with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and any
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such Incurrence
and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the proceeds thereof) the Fixed Charge
Coverage Ratio for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
(“Permitted Debt”):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or
bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, in a maximum aggregate principal amount
at any time outstanding not exceeding the sum of:

(i) £4,000 million,

(ii) £792 million,

(iii) the greater of (x) £1,200 million and (y) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA,

(iv) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, an unlimited amount, if
on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro

306


-----

_forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage_
Ratio for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been
no greater than 3.0 to 1.0, and,

(v) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any
portion thereof, the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, fees, underwriting
discounts, premia and other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such
refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of
Indebtedness or other obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other obligations (including
any Guarantees thereof) is not prohibited under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” Indebtedness
arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to any Person securing Indebtedness
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence
of such Indebtedness is not prohibited under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that:

(a) in the case of Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor owing to and
held by any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (except in respect of intercompany
current liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice
in connection with Cash Management Services of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries), such Indebtedness shall be unsecured and expressly subordinated
in right of payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the
Senior Secured Notes, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and the respective
Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor, in each case to the extent required by the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such
Indebtedness to a Person other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness
not permitted by this clause (3) by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness:

(a) consisting of any “parallel debt” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Security Documents related to the Senior Credit Facilities, the Existing Senior Secured
Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, the Senior Secured Notes or the
Notes Guarantees,

(b) of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries outstanding on the Issue
Date or Incurred under a facility committed and as in effect on the Issue Date, after giving
effect to the Richmond Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds
thereof, other than Indebtedness deemed initially Incurred under clause (1)(i) of this
paragraph or described in clauses (3) or (4)(f) of this paragraph,

307

(c) represented by any Guarantees of the Existing Senior Notes outstanding on the Issue Date
and any “parallel debt” obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security
Documents related to the Existing Senior Notes and Guarantees of the Existing Senior
Notes,

(d) consisting of Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described
in clauses (4), (5) (other than Indebtedness described in clauses (4)(f), (5)(z)) and (12) of
this paragraph or Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant,

(e) Incurred to finance Management Advances; and

(f) consisting of Existing Senior Secured Notes outstanding on the Issue Date, after giving
effect to the Richmond Transactions, in an aggregate principal amount that is in excess of
the £500 million principal amount of Existing Senior Secured Notes classified under
paragraph (1)(i) of this paragraph.

(5) Indebtedness (i) of any Person outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary or is merged, consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including
pursuant to any acquisition of assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) of such Person, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary Incurred to provide all or a portion of the funds utilised to consummate a
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which any Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
or pursuant to which an acquisition of any store, warehouse or other operational site was made;
_provided that:_

(x) for any such Indebtedness that is not Senior Secured Indebtedness, after giving pro forma
effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness,
either (A) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would have been able to Incur £1.00 of
additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or (B) the Fixed
Charge Coverage Ratio for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related
Incurrence of Indebtedness,

(y) for any such Indebtedness that is Senior Secured Indebtedness, after giving _pro forma_
effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness,
either (A) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would have been able to Incur £1.00 of
additional Senior Secured Indebtedness pursuant to clause (1)(iv) of this paragraph or (B)
the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or
other transaction and to the related Incurrence of Indebtedness, or

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in its
sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and
only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in one
or more of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that
any Senior Secured Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility pursuant to clauses (7), (11) or
(15) of the second paragraph of this covenant shall cease to be deemed Incurred or outstanding
pursuant to such clauses and shall be deemed Incurred and outstanding pursuant to clause (1)(iv) of
the second paragraph of this covenant (and any related Lien shall be deemed Incurred pursuant to
clause (b)(iii) of the definition of “Permitted Collateral Liens”) from and after the first date on which
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries could have Incurred such Indebtedness
and Lien thereunder; _provided further,_ that any Indebtedness (other than Senior Secured
Indebtedness) Incurred pursuant to clauses (7), (11), (15) and (16) of the second paragraph of this
covenant shall cease to be deemed Incurred or outstanding pursuant to such clauses and shall be
deemed Incurred and outstanding pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the
first date on which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may
be, could have Incurred such Indebtedness thereunder (to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, are able to reclassify or Incur any Liens securing such
Indebtedness under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens” after such
reclassification, if applicable);

(2) (A) Senior Secured Notes outstanding on the Issue Date, (B) £500 million of Existing Senior
Secured Notes outstanding on the Issue Date, after giving effect to the Richmond Transactions, and
(C) term loan Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Credit Facilities, after
giving effect to the Richmond Transactions, shall, in each case, be deemed initially Incurred under

311


-----

clause (1)(i) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) or
4(f) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, letters of
guarantee, bank guarantees, bankers’ acceptances, performance guarantees, performance bonds,
demand guarantees, warranty guarantees, warranty bonds, bond sureties, payment bonds or other
similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, letters of guarantee, bank
guarantees, bankers’ acceptances, performance guarantees, performance bonds, demand guarantees,
warranty guarantees, warranty bonds, bond sureties, payment bonds or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7),
(11), (12), (13), (15) or (16) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and such
instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of Indebtedness represented by any Disqualified Stock of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal
to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either
case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one
or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and

(8) in the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases
commitments to Incur Indebtedness or any Lien pursuant to clauses (10), (28), (30) or (31) of the
definition of “Permitted Liens” or any Permitted Collateral Lien, the Incurrence thereof for all
purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes of
calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or the
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, will, at the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date such commitments are entered into or increased
pursuant to binding documentation or (b) be determined on the date such Indebtedness or Liens are
Incurred. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to test Incurrence as described in the preceding
sub-clause (a), the full amount of Indebtedness made available under such commitments (the
“Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), and the related Liens, will be deemed Incurred on the date of
execution of such binding documentation and, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated
Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or any other Indebtedness
or Lien Incurrence test under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at
such time, any borrowing, re-borrowing or issuance of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments thereunder will be permitted under this covenant and under the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Liens,” irrespective of whether the same Incurrence test is met at
the time of actual borrowing, re-borrowing or issuance of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or
other similar instruments thereunder. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may revoke such election at
any time and from time to time.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation of
original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in
the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or
obligations initially not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of
Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as otherwise
specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case
of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount or (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof,
in the case of any other Indebtedness.

312


-----

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not
permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be permitted to designate such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary
and any such designation will not be deemed operative under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture).

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred or, at
the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, first committed pursuant to binding documentation; provided that, (a)
if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and
such refinancing would cause the applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the
relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall
be deemed not to have been exceeded, so long as the principal amount (or, if issued with original issue discount, the
aggregate issue price) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the
definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue
Date, as applicable; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency
Agreement (with respect to the pound sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount
of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be
exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness
Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced,
shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

Neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted
Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior
Secured Notes and the applicable Notes Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that
no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with
different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall
or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or
indirectly, to:

Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise considered
Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); and

(d) dividends or distributions payable to, payments on Subordinated Shareholder Funding held
by, and loans or other advances made to, any Parent to fund payments of interest, premia
or break costs in respect of Indebtedness (or any refinancing Indebtedness thereof) of such
Parent if (x) such Indebtedness is, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, Guaranteed
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise considered
Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and (y) any
net proceeds from such initial Indebtedness are, directly or indirectly, contributed to the
equity of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form or
otherwise lent to or received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary in any form; provided that (i) any net proceeds described in the preceding subclause (y) shall be excluded for purposes of increasing the amount available for distribution
pursuant to clause (b)(ii) below and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the second paragraph of
this covenant;

Notes Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer held by Persons

Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or
retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund
payment, any Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such payment, purchase, repurchase,
redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund
obligation, principal instalment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of
payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement and (b)
any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,”);

(4) make any payment (other than by capitalisation of interest) on or with respect to, or purchase,
repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Subordinated Shareholder
Funding, except as permitted by clause (1)(d) above; or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person,

(any such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition,
retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) are referred to herein as a
“Restricted Payment”), if:

(a) at the time the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes any such
Restricted Payment other than a Restricted Investment,

(i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result
immediately thereafter therefrom); or

(ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not able to Incur an additional £1.00 of

_Limitation on Indebtedness” after giving effect, on a_ _pro forma_ basis, to such
Restricted Payment; or

second paragraph) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

(19) of the second paragraph of this covenant, or is permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and/or
one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investment,” the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later
reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment
(or portion thereof) in any manner that complies with this covenant, including as an Investment pursuant to one of
more clauses contained in the definition of “Permitted Investment.”

319


-----

Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this covenant or in the definition of “Permitted Investments,”
neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary shall distribute or transfer, directly or indirectly,
any material intellectual property rights owned or licensed as of the Issue Date to any Affiliate of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer (other than a Restricted Subsidiary) by way of a Restricted Payment or a Permitted Investment (including
transferring such material intellectual property rights to a Restricted Subsidiary in contemplation of designating it as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary).

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment to, or a Permitted
Investment into, any Parent (including by way of prepayment, purchase or redemption of any Proceeds Loan prior to
scheduled maturity) to fund the repayment, prepayment, purchase or redemption of any Subordinated Indebtedness
by such Parent, there shall be no double-counting of the two transactions for the purposes of this covenant and only
the former, not the latter, shall be deemed a Restricted Payment or a Permitted Investment made by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**_Limitation on Liens_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any
income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the “Initial Lien”), except:

(a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral,

(1) Permitted Liens, or

(2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens, if the Senior Secured Notes and
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or a Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens over
property or assets of a Guarantor) are, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, directly
secured equally and ratably with or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Pari Passu
Indebtedness, or prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness,
the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien, for so long as such Indebtedness is so secured
(and any Lien so created to secure the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or a Notes Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates); and

(b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien securing the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Notes Guarantees
will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged as set forth under “—Release of Liens.”

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Liens shall be required to secure the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or the Notes Guarantees over property, assets or Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary
that is a member of the Regulated Group or over any intercompany receivables owed by or to members of the
Regulated Group; upon any Restricted Subsidiary becoming a member of the Regulated Group, Security Interests over
such property, assets, Capital Stock or intercompany receivables shall be automatically and unconditionally released
and discharged.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any property or asset of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor subject only to a floating charge (and not any other Lien) under any
Security Document, to the extent such floating charge has not crystallised into a fixed charge, shall not be deemed
Collateral (including for purposes of determining whether a Permitted Lien is permitted over such asset or property)
pursuant to this covenant.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise
cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of
any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary,

_provided_ that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions prior to
dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock, and (y) the subordination of (including the
application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) Any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to or arising from (a) any Credit Facility (including the
Senior Credit Facilities), (b) the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement,

Senior Notes Indenture, (d) any other agreement or instrument of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a Person, or relating to
any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such

Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is
assumed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an
acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration for, or to
provide all or any portion of the funds utilised to consummate, the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such
transaction) and outstanding on such date; _provided_ that, if another Person is the Successor
Company (as defined under “—Merger and Consolidation”), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement
or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor
Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred
to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an “Initial Agreement”) or contained in
any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2)
of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with
respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less
favourable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or
amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or a member of Senior Management);

321


-----

(4) (a) any encumbrance or restriction:

(i) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, licence or similar contract, or the
assignment or transfer of any lease, licence or other contract;

(ii) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict
the transfer of the property or assets subject to such mortgages, charges, pledges
or other security agreements; or

(iii) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests
set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(b) any encumbrance, restriction, inhibition, covenant, restrictive covenant, grant of rights,
stipulation, agreement, interest, overriding interest, wayleave, option, right of pre-emption,
right of first refusal or charge registered or existing, in each case, in respect of any real
property interests of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary as at the
Issue Date or not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations, lease agreements, Ground
Rent Transactions or Sale and Leaseback Transactions permitted under the Senior Secured Notes

leased, or any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes
restrictions on the distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any of its property or
assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition
to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the
property or assets that are subject to such restriction), pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the
covenant described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” if:

(i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument, taken as
a whole, are not materially less favourable to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes than
(a) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement,
together with the security documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor
Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Issue Date or (b) is customary in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior
Management), or

322

(ii) where the Senior Secured Notes Issuer determines that such encumbrance or restriction
will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability
to make principal or interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with factoring, securitisations, receivables financings or similar
arrangements, including (without limitation) by a Securitisation Subsidiary in a Qualified

of Senior Management, are necessary or advisable to effect such factoring, securitisations,
receivables financings or similar arrangements;

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any
Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such
Asset Disposition is not less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of as of the date of
entry into binding documentation in respect of such Asset Disposition (as determined by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer’s Board of Directors); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
receives in respect of such Asset Disposition consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of
such Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of
such Asset Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) (x) the assumption by the purchaser of any liabilities recorded on the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer’s or such Restricted Subsidiary’s balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred
since the date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet)
(other than Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such
liabilities, or (y) Indebtedness or obligations of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a
Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and every other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such

Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness (i) has been
extinguished by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, and (ii) is not
Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all
other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any

£120.0 million (with the fair market value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash
Consideration being measured at the time received and without giving effect to subsequent
changes in value); or

(viii) any combination of the types of consideration specified in the preceding clauses (i) through
(vii).

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, within 360 days
(or such period as provided in clause (H) below, if applicable) of the later of the date of consummation of such Asset
Disposition and receipt of such Net Available Cash, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
may use the Net Available Cash to:

(A) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary
tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Senior Secured
Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation _on Indebtedness” or any Senior Secured Notes issued as of the Issue_
Date; provided that (in respect of Senior Secured Indebtedness Incurred under clause
(1)(iv) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation _on_
_Indebtedness”) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be entitled to prepay, repay, purchase_
or redeem such Indebtedness that constitutes Public Debt only if the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to
purchase Senior Secured Notes, in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an
Asset Disposition Offer, in such an amount as would reduce the aggregate principal amount
of Senior Secured Notes then outstanding in the same proportion as the aggregate principal
amount of such other Indebtedness would be reduced by such prepayments, repayments,
purchases or redemptions;

(ii) unless included in the preceding clause (A)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem
(including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated
transactions at market prices) Senior Secured Notes or other Senior Secured Indebtedness
that is Pari Passu Indebtedness; _provided_ that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be
entitled to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem such other Senior Secured Indebtedness that
constitutes Public Debt only if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer makes (at such time or in
compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase Senior Secured Notes, in
accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer, in such an
amount as would reduce the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes then
outstanding in the same proportion as the aggregate principal amount of such other Senior
Secured Indebtedness would be reduced by such prepayments, repayments, purchases or
redemptions; or

(iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary
tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Indebtedness or
obligations of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness or
obligations that are secured on assets that do not constitute Collateral (in each case, other
than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor or
Indebtedness owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);

_provided that in the case of an Asset Disposition of assets comprising Collateral, the Senior Secured_
Notes Issuer may prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Subordinated Indebtedness secured by a Lien

324


-----

on the Collateral only if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer first makes (at such time or in compliance
with this covenant) an offer to Holders of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes to purchase their
Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition
Offer;

(B) purchase any series of Senior Secured Notes, in whole or in part, pursuant to an offer to all Holders
of such series of Senior Secured Notes, redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary
tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any series of Senior Secured
Notes, in whole or in part, pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or make an Asset Disposition Offer to all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (in
accordance with the procedures set out below);

(C) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Person engaged in a
Similar Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, such Person is or
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(E) make a capital expenditure;

(F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful
in a Similar Business;

(G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(H) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, provided that, a binding commitment shall be
treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until
the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated, and (y) the 180th day following
the expiration of the aforementioned 360-day period, if the investment has not been consummated
by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth above constitutes “Excess Proceeds.”
Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may temporarily reduce
revolving credit borrowings or otherwise use such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

On the 361st day (or the 541[st ]day if a binding commitment as described in clause (H) is entered into) after
an Asset Disposition, or such earlier time as the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess
Proceeds exceeds £50.0 million, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to
make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all Holders and, to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects, to
all or some holders of other outstanding Senior Secured Indebtedness that is Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the
maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such other Senior Secured Indebtedness that may be
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price, in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, and, in respect of such other Senior Secured Indebtedness, of no more than 100% of the
principal amount thereof, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and in minimum
denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Senior Secured Indebtedness that is
Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less
than the Excess Proceeds, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (the “Retained
**Declined Proceeds”) for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate**
amount of Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall
be allocated among the tendering holders of Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness pro
_rata based on the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness so_

325


-----

tendered and not properly withdrawn. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
tendered in an Asset Disposition Offer that is not denominated in sterling, such principal amount shall be converted
into its Sterling Equivalent as of a date selected by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition
Offer Period or no more than five Business Days prior to the beginning of the Asset Disposition Offer Period. Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are denominated, the
amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the
currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period
of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than
five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase
**Date”), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent**
it elects, Senior Secured Indebtedness required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to such offer (the “Asset
**Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all**
Senior Secured Notes and Senior Secured Indebtedness that is Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response
to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful,
accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured
Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Senior Secured
Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than
the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes
and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum
denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Senior
Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in accordance with
the terms of this covenant. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly
(but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or
deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for purchase. Any Senior
Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred or returned in accordance with
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream) by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e)
of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured
Notes pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligation
to make an Asset Disposition Offer may be waived or modified with the consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding
principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (with such consent, for the avoidance of doubt, to be considered effective
if the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes of consenting Holders represents a majority of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes as a whole and without regard to the level of
consent obtained among Holders of each constituent series of Senior Secured Notes).

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to enter into
or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any
property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (any such transaction

326


-----

or series of related transactions being an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of the greater
of 10% of Consolidated EBITDA and £120 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction, taken as a whole, are not materially less favourable to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could
be obtained in a comparable transaction with a Person who is not an Affiliate at the time of such
transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm’s-length
dealings; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of 20%
of Consolidated EBITDA and £240 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related
transactions have been approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

_Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause_
(9)(b)(ii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on Restricted
_Payments”) or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs_
(1)(b) and (2) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to the terms of, the

(ii) any other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital
Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, (iii) restricted
stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar
employee benefits or consultants’ plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred
compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or (iv)
indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the
Board of Directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in each case, in the ordinary course of
business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(or entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among
Restricted Subsidiaries or any Securitisation Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses

Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through
any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(i) the America Acquisition Transactions and the Richmond Transactions;

(ii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of

agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and
instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or

extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect; and

(iii) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement
pursuant to which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is required
or permitted to file a consolidated tax return, or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated

or consistent with past practice;

(8) transactions with customers, contractors, clients, franchisees, licensees, sub-licensees, crosslicensees, landlords (including superior landlords), lessors, sub-lessors, trade creditors, service

of business or consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the
relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or a
member of Senior Management, or are on terms no less favourable than those that could reasonably
have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or among
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely

members of the Board of Directors in their reasonable determination, and (b) any amendment,

(11) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors in good faith;

(12) any transactions for which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers to
the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to

Intercreditor Agreement (including as described under “—IPO Debt Pushdown” and “Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions Following an IPO”);_
and

(17) any transactions that comply with the parameters prescribed in one or more framework agreements
that establish the terms governing contracts or transactions between the parties from time to time,
_provided the relevant framework agreement or framework agreements have been duly approved by_
the Board of Directors and the terms of such agreement or agreements, taken as a whole, are no less
favourable than could reasonably be obtained in a comparable framework agreement in arm’s-length
dealings with an unaffiliated party at the time of entry into binding documentation.

**_Reports_**

So long as any Senior Secured Notes are outstanding, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will furnish to the
Trustee the following reports:

(1) within 120 days after the end of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s fiscal year, annual reports
containing, to the extent applicable: (i) an operating and financial review of the audited financial
statements, including a discussion of the results of operation, financial condition and liquidity and
capital resources (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will not need to include divisional or segment
financial information other than as required under IFRS); (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement
and balance sheet information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, together with explanatory
footnotes, for any material acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred since the beginning of the
most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (unless such pro forma
information has been provided in a previous report provided pursuant to clauses (2) or (3) below);
_provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available_
without unreasonable expense, in which case the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will provide, in the
case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) the audited consolidated balance
sheet of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as at the end of the most recent fiscal year and audited
consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for
the most recent two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for
and as at the end of such fiscal years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial

Issuer, material affiliate transactions; and a description of all material debt instruments, and (v) a
description of material operational risk factors and material subsequent events; provided that the
information described in clauses (iv) and (v) above may be provided in the footnotes to the audited
financial statements;

(2) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three quarters in each fiscal year of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer ending after the Issue Date, quarterly financial statements containing the
following information: (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s unaudited condensed consolidated
balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash
flow for the most recent quarter or year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance
sheet date and the comparable prior period, together with condensed footnote disclosure (which, for
the avoidance of doubt, will not need to include divisional or segment financial information other
than as required under IFRS); (ii) unaudited _pro forma_ income statement and balance sheet
information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any
material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalisations that have occurred since the beginning of the

329


-----

most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates (provided that such pro
_forma_ financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable
expense, in which case the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will provide, in the case of a material
acquisition, acquired company financials); (iii) a concise operating and financial review of the
unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition,
results of operations and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer; (iv) a discussion of material changes in material debt instruments since the most recent
report; and (v) material subsequent events and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed in
the most recent annual report; provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and (v) may
be provided in the footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; and

(3) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer announces
publicly or any acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material
to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or a senior
executive officer or director changes at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a change in auditors of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a report containing a description of such event; provided that, if
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer intends to make a public announcement of the appointment of a
new senior executive officer other than by means of a report pursuant to this clause (3), the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer may delay furnishing such report to the Trustee until the day on which the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer otherwise makes such public announcement.

In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon
the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities
Act for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are
not “affiliates” under the Securities Act.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Senior
Secured Notes copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the website of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the
Company or any Parent of the Company that delivers the relevant reports pursuant to this covenant.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS and on a consistent basis for
the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports
set forth in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this covenant may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a
basis that applied to such periods. Except as specified in the second succeeding paragraph, no report need include
separate financial statements for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any disclosure with
respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering
Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may satisfy its obligations under the
preceding paragraphs of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual and quarterly reports or
other information of the Company or any Parent of the Company, for so long as the Company or such Parent is either
a Subsidiary or a Parent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. To the extent that material differences exist between the
management, business, assets, shareholding or results of operations or financial condition of such other reporting
entity and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the annual and quarterly reports shall include a concise description and an
unaudited reconciliation of such material differences. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs of
this covenant.

At any time that any of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any
such Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first
paragraph of this covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements
or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted
Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

330


-----

All reports provided pursuant to this covenant shall be made in the English language. In the event that (i) the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a)
with the SEC or (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the
SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) the reporting requirements of
Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits
or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying
with the foregoing requirement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions
contained in this covenant.

Following an initial public offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity or the listing of such Capital Stock
on a recognised stock exchange, the reporting obligations of the reporting entity pursuant to the preceding paragraphs
of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements
of such stock exchange (other than with respect to delivery of a compliance certificate).

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer,
lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person organised
and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom,
Jersey, the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and
delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
and (b) all obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (if any) and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of
such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time
of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able
to Incur at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not
be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that execution and delivery of the binding documentation
providing for such consolidation, merger or transfer and of such supplemental indenture (if any) do
not result in a breach of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect
that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorised, executed and delivered and is a
valid and binding agreement, enforceable against the Successor Company in accordance with its
terms (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), provided that in
giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
(or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any
such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto,

331


-----

shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “—Limitation on
_Indebtedness.”_

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or
substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to any
person other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which properties and assets, if held
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly,
in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve
“substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant)
shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has
complied with the covenant described under “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” or (ii) the creation
of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary.

_The Guarantors_

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the assets of
such Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of
related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor or, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, becomes a Guarantor (pursuant to
a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee);

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or, subject
to the Agreed Security Principles, the transferee Person expressly assumes all of the
obligations of the Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); and (2) immediately after giving effect to the
transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a
Guarantor (in each case other than to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,

_provided, however,_ that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this heading “—The Guarantors” shall
not apply to the extent that compliance with clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1)
any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference,

332


-----

“thin capitalisation” rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or
regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers,
directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the
partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any
Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary
that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of
its properties and assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not
a Guarantor; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) a Guarantor transferring all or part of its properties and
assets to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor in order to comply with any law, rule, regulation or order,
recommendation or directions of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (iv) any consolidation or merger of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not the surviving entity of such
merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under
the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading “—Senior Secured
_Notes Issuer” shall apply to such transaction; (v) a Permitted Reorganisation or the solvent liquidation of any_
Restricted Subsidiary; (vi) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or
combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organised for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that
clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading “—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer” or clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B) under the
heading “—The Guarantors,” as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction; and (vii) any corporate
reorganisations or other steps necessary or advisable to consummate or facilitate the Richmond Transactions.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status
and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that
day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status
(the “Reversion Date”), the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture summarised under the following
captions will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes:

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Indebtedness”;

(3) “—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions”;

(5) “—Additional Notes Guarantees”;

(6) “—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock”;

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer”; and_

(8) “Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions, Ground Rent Transactions and Qualified
_Securitisation Financings Involving Real Property”;_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will cease to be
effective and will not be applicable to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

333


-----

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day
on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to
actions of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance
of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default.
The “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all
Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on
the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” as applicable. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also permit,
without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
to honour any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Senior Secured Notes
cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the
Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Secured Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status.
The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph of this
covenant has been satisfied, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants
described under this covenant to be effective.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade
Status.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not, and in each case, shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of
materially impairing the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that neither the Incurrence
of Permitted Collateral Liens nor any repayment of intercompany receivables from time to time shall be under any
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of
the Trustee and the Holders, and the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not, and in each
case, shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit
of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that:

(i) the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Permitted Collateral Liens and Permitted Liens (including, without limitation, Permitted Liens over
any property or asset of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor subject only to a floating
charge (and not any other Lien) under any Security Document, to the extent such floating charge
has not crystallised into a fixed charge) and the Collateral may be discharged and released and
retaken in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents,
the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent applicable in
each case;

(ii) the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified or replaced, from time to time to: (1) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or
inconsistency therein, (2) further secure the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior
Secured Notes), (3) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure
Additional Senior Secured Notes, (4) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (5) amend the
Security Documents in accordance with the terms thereof, or (6) make any other change to any such
agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect;

(iii) any Permitted Reorganisation may be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture;

(iv) any corporate reorganisations or other steps necessary or advisable to consummate or facilitate the
Richmond Transactions may be implemented; or

334


-----

(v) the Security Documents may otherwise be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented,
released and retaken, or replaced where, contemporaneously with any such action, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer delivers to the Trustee:

(1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an
Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, as applicable, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or replacement,

(2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person confirming the solvency of
the person granting such Security Interests, after giving effect to any transactions related
to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or replacement,
or

(3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the
Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed,
restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any
limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or
Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension,
renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (as
applicable) comply with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to
customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the
Holders.

**_Additional Notes Guarantees_**

No Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor shall Guarantee (i) any Indebtedness of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Guarantor under any Syndicated Term Facilities, (ii) any Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Guarantor under any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending commitments in excess of
£50.0 million at the relevant date of determination, or (iii) any Public Debt, unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or
becomes a Guarantor by no later than 10 Business Days after the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if
applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee; provided that:

(a) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to provide a Notes Guarantee pursuant to this covenant
as a result of Incurring a Guarantee under clause (2)(b) of the definition of “Permitted Debt”;

(b) no Restricted Subsidiary that is a member of the Regulated Group shall be required to provide a
Notes Guarantee pursuant to this covenant; and

(c) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be obligated to become a Guarantor pursuant to this covenant to the
extent that, and for so long as, the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee would be inconsistent with
the Agreed Security Principles or may reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (1) any
breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, “thin capitalisation” rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or
the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk
or liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) which cannot be avoided
through measures reasonably available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or
regulatory filings undertaken in connection with such Notes Guarantee.

335


-----

At the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on such
Guarantor’s liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognise certain defences generally available to guarantors
(including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate
purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally) or
other considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under “—Notes
_Guarantees.” A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Senior Secured Notes_
Issuer if, at the date of such release, there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after
the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture if such
Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary
actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the
Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each
Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in “Risk Factors” and “Certain Insolvency
_Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.”_

**_Financial Calculations_**

When determining whether any transaction is permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer shall be permitted to test it, at its option, (i) on the date binding documentation for such
transaction is entered into, (ii) on the date that any notice of any repayment, redemption, repurchase or refinancing of
any Indebtedness is given to the holders thereof (if applicable), (iii) to the extent the nature or circumstances of a
transaction make (i) or (ii) inapplicable, on the date that notice of such transaction is provided to the Trustee or the
Holders in accordance with the provisions described in “—Notices” below or (iv) the date such transaction is
consummated. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to test the transaction as described in the preceding clauses
(i), (ii) or (iii), the determination as to whether the transaction is permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
shall be made assuming that the transaction and other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith were
consummated on the date binding documentation was entered into or such notice was given to the Trustee or the
Holders (each, an “Alternative Testing Date”), as applicable. If the transaction was permitted on the Alternative
Testing Date chosen by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, it shall continue to be deemed so permitted under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture even if it would have otherwise resulted in a Default or an Event of Default on the date it is
consummated. When determining whether any transaction is permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as
of the Alternative Testing Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make all necessary calculations as set forth under
the definition of “Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio.”

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has elected to test a transaction on an Alternative Testing Date (an
“Alternative Testing Date Election”), the transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on such date for the purposes
of making any other determination under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, until such time (the “Election
**Termination Time”) as (a) the transaction is definitively terminated, cancelled or abandoned, (b) the Senior Secured**
Notes Issuer has revoked its Alternative Testing Date Election and has instead opted to test the transaction on the date
it is consummated, which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be entitled to do, irrevocably and only once, at any
time until the transaction is consummated, or (c) the transaction is consummated. From the time the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer makes an Alternative Testing Date Election to the related Election Termination Time, the provisions of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will apply assuming that the relevant transaction was consummated on the
Alternative Testing Date. No action properly taken by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries between an Alternative Testing Date Election and the related Election Termination Time will constitute
a Default or an Event of Default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture will permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries to honour any contractual commitments undertaken during such period of time, so long as they
were not undertaken in anticipation of the Election Termination Time.

If (x) any restriction, basket, threshold or permission is determined by reference to the greater of a fixed
amount (the “fixed component”) and a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA (the “grower component”) and (y) the
grower component of the applicable restriction, basket, threshold or permission exceeds the applicable fixed

336


-----

component at any time, the fixed component shall be deemed to be increased to the highest amount of the grower
component reached from time to time and shall not subsequently be reduced as a result of any subsequent decrease in
the grower component.

**_Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions, Ground Rent Transactions and Qualified Securitisation_**
**_Financings Involving Real Property_**

The Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not consummate Sale and Leaseback Transactions,
Ground Rent Transactions or Qualified Securitisation Financings involving real property with any Person (other than
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary) that, when taken together with all Sale and Leaseback Transactions,
Ground Rent Transactions and Qualified Securitisation Financings involving real property consummated since the
Issue Date (and, in the case of such Qualified Securitisation Financings involving real property, that remain
outstanding at the date of determination), would yield, in aggregate, gross proceeds of more than £3,000 million
(excluding value added taxes).

**_Events of Default_**

Each of the following is an “Event of Default” under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note issued under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with its other agreements contained in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee
now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately
upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness (“payment
**default”); or**

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross
**acceleration provision”),**

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of
which has been so accelerated, aggregates £60 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary or any group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements
for the Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer), would constitute a Significant
Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(6) failure by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant

337


-----

Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of £60 million (exclusive of any amounts
that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid,
discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment
**default provision”);**

(7) (a) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, and except through the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Trustee or Security
Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in excess of £60.0 million, for any
reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
or the release of any such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents, or (b) any such security interest created thereunder shall be declared invalid or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall assert
in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and, in each case under the
preceding clauses (a) and (b), any such Default continues for 10 days (the “security default
**provision”); provided that the granting of a Permitted Lien over any property or asset of the Senior**
Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor subject only to a floating charge (and not any other Lien) under
any Security Document, to the extent such floating charge has not crystallised into a fixed charge,
shall not be deemed a breach of this security default provision; and

(8) any Notes Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than in
accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) or is
declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or any Guarantor denies or
disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Notes Guarantee and, in each case, any such Default
continues for 10 days (the “guarantees provision”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Default under clauses (4) or (6) of the preceding paragraph will not
constitute an Event of Default unless the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture notify the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of the Default and
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer fails to cure such Default within the time specified in clauses (4) or (6) of the preceding
paragraph, after receipt of such notice, as applicable.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing,
the Trustee by notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, by written notice to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest
will be due and payable immediately. For the avoidance of doubt, the bankruptcy provisions will exclude the
enforcement of Liens described in clause (31) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” including by way of appointment
of a receiver for such purpose.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default
described in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured
Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default
pursuant to clause (4) has been remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness that gave rise to such
Event of Default, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default has been discharged in full, within 30
days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior
Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all other
Events of Default outstanding, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Secured Notes that
became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable
without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

338


-----

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior
Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents
except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any), and rescind any such acceleration with respect
to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an
Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or
powers under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders
have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense.
Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may
pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested
the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss,
liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and
the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not
given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request
within such 60-day period.

Other than in cases where the Senior Secured Notes Indenture permits the Trustee or the Security Agent to
act without instructions from Holders or with instructions given by Holders of a lower percentage of principal amount
of Senior Secured Notes outstanding, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured
Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be entitled to (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting
any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the
Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, (ii) give instructions to the Security Agent for the purpose of taking,
ceasing or refraining from taking any enforcement action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, (iii) give instructions to the Security Agent for the
purpose of granting or withholding any such consent or exercising any such remedy or power as may be required or
contemplated under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents or (iv) give instructions to the Trustee for the purposes of giving or withholding any such consent, taking,
ceasing or refraining from taking any such action or exercising any such remedy or power as may be contemplated
under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in
the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs.
The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee
in personal liability, provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that
is not inconsistent with such direction.

339


-----

Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to
indemnification and/or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses
caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs
and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee must
give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Except
in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the
Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the
Holders. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely
without further inquiry on), within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating
whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Senior
Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry
on), within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would
constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take
in respect thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such
Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action, and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate
pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery
of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not
within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured
Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with
the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding
(including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured
Notes); provided that, if any amendment, supplement, other modification or waiver will only amend, supplement or
waive a default or provision affecting only one series of the Senior Secured Notes, only the consent of Holders
representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such series
shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes affected, then outstanding, an amendment or waiver of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or
the Senior Secured Notes may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,
waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Senior Secured
Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Secured Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Secured Note or change the time at
which any Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “—
_Optional Redemption”;_

(5) make any Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior Secured Note;

340


-----

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional Amounts,
if any, on such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit
for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes;

(7) make any change to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described under “—
_Withholding Taxes” that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in_
any material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result
in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any
obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes (except pursuant to a rescission
of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate
principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted
from such acceleration); or

(9) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence,

_provided, however,_ that if such amendment or waiver described above only affects or would only affect
Holders of one or more series of Senior Secured Notes (but not all series of Senior Secured Notes), only the
consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior
Secured Notes of the series so affected shall be required.

Without the consent of Holders holding not less than 80% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes affected, then outstanding, an amendment or waiver of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the
Security Documents may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a non-consenting Holder, (a) release
all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the applicable Security Documents, or (b) permit all or substantially all of the
relevant Guarantors to be released from their obligations under the Notes Guarantees or the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement
and any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement; provided that, if any such amendment or waiver will only
amend, supplement or waive a default or provision affecting only one or more series of the Senior Secured Notes,
only the consent of Holders representing 80% in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Secured
Notes of the series so affected shall be required.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes
Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender
any right or power conferred upon the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any
material respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of Senior Management) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

341


-----

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness” or “—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees,” to add Notes Guarantees with respect to the Senior_
Secured Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and
evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the
Collateral and the Security Documents) or any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or
securing the Senior Secured Notes when such release, termination, discharge or retaking or
amendment is provided for under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security
Documents or the Senior Secured Notes to any provision of this “Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes” to the extent that such provision in this “Description of the Senior Secured_ _Notes” was_
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor
Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by
the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest
in favour of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities
Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Senior Facilities
Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a
security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a
security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting of such
security interest is not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest” is complied with; or_

(10) as provided in “—Additional Intercreditor Agreements” or in “—Certain Covenants—Impairment
_of Security Interest”;_

_provided that, only the consent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the relevant Guarantors_
or security providers shall be required to give effect to any amendment or supplement providing for additional
Notes Guarantees or security or modifying the terms of Notes Guarantees or security pursuant to the
preceding clauses (3), (6), (7), (9) or (10).

The Trustee and the Security Agent (where relevant) shall, at the direction of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
sign any supplemental indenture or other documentation that gives effect to amendments, waivers or supplements
authorised as described under this heading “Amendments and Waivers” if the amendment, waiver or supplement does
not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent. Except as set forth in the preceding proviso,
it shall only be necessary for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent (where relevant) to
authorise and execute a supplemental indenture or other documentation in order to effect an amendment, waiver or
supplement authorised as described under this heading “Amendments and Waivers.” Unless otherwise specified by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a waiver authorised as described under this heading “Amendments and Waivers” will
become effective once the requisite consent of Holders has been obtained, without execution of any supplemental
indenture or other documentation.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured
Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

342


-----

A written consent to an amendment or a waiver by a Holder shall bind the Holder and every subsequent
Holder of that Senior Secured Note or portion of the Senior Secured Notes that evidences the same Indebtedness as
the consenting Holder’s Senior Secured Note, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the Senior
Secured Note. Unless otherwise specified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the relevant request for consent, such
Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the written consent or waiver as to such Holder’s Senior Secured Note or
portion of such Senior Secured Note if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date on which the
Trustee receives an Officer’s Certificate from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer certifying that the requisite number of
consents have been received. After an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of
determining the Holders entitled to give their written consent or take any other action. If a record date is fixed, then
only those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give
such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons
continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 180 days after
such record date.

For purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes have taken any action under this Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of
Senior Secured Notes will be deemed to be the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior
Secured Notes as of (i) the record date in respect of such action (if a record date has been set with respect to the taking
of such action), (ii) the date the taking of such action by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of such
Senior Secured Notes has been certified to the Trustee by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or (iii) as of a date selected
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is within the consent delivery period or no more than five Business Days prior
to the beginning of the consent delivery period, as specified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the relevant consent
materials.

In formulating their decisions on matters set forth in this Section “Amendments and Waivers,” the Trustee
and the Security Agent shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as they deem necessary,
including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

For avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with any of the
covenants described under, “—Certain Covenants” and any related definitions shall be deemed to impair or affect any
rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on,
the Senior Secured Notes.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, Independent Debt Funds of Permitted Holders)
will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

Subject to the provisions below, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer at any time may terminate all of its
obligations and the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes, the
Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (“legal defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults
and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights,
powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of
Senior Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office or
agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Security
Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at such time will
terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

343


-----

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors’ obligations under the
covenants described under “Certain Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “—Certain Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer”) and “Change of Control” and the default provisions relating_
to such covenants described under “Events of Default” above, the operation of the cross-default upon a payment
default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer and
Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the security default provision
described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may, at its option and at any time, exercise its legal defeasance option
notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer exercises its
legal defeasance option, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default
with respect to such Senior Secured Notes. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option
with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an
Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under
“—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer”), (4), (5) (other than with
respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer), (6), (7) or (8) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit in
trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee for
this purpose), for the benefit of Holders of Senior Secured Notes, cash in sterling or sterling-denominated UK
Government Obligations or a combination thereof for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest on the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes to the applicable date of redemption or Stated Maturity, as the case may be, and
must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Senior Secured
Notes will not recognise income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and
in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance
had not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United
States must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable
U.S. federal income tax law);

(2) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer; and

(3) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or
relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and cease to
be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Senior Secured Notes,
as expressly provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Secured Notes when:

(1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain
lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes, and certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision
for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer) have been delivered to the Principal Paying Agent or the Registrar for cancellation; or
(b) all Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Principal Paying Agent or the Registrar
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated
Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Principal Paying
Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer;

344


-----

(2) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or another
entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose), for the benefit of Holders
of Senior Secured Notes, money or sterling-denominated UK Government Obligations, or a
combination thereof in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the
Senior Secured Notes not previously delivered to the Principal Paying Agent or the Registrar for
cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior
Secured Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as
the case may be;

(3) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(4) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the
funds deposited towards the payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption
date, as the case may be; and

(5) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion
of Counsel (which the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on) each to the effect that
all conditions precedent under the “Satisfaction and Discharge” section of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been
complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters
of fact (including as to compliance with the preceding clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

If requested in writing by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable
notice of redemption or pursuant to the applicable Officer’s Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other
entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts
deposited with it to the Holders prior to the applicable redemption date or Stated Maturity, as applicable, of the Senior
Secured Notes; provided that Holders shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of
doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable redemption date or Stated Maturity, as
applicable, of the Senior Secured Notes as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value
adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Senior Secured Notes are represented
by a Global Senior Secured Note deposited with a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the
beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then
applicable procedures of such clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such
obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note waives and releases all such liability.
The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not
be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver
is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.
The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee
will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and use the same
degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to
take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be construed as an
obligation or duty.

345


-----

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it
become a creditor of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realise on
certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage
in other transactions with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed,
and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders
of a majority in principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or may resign at any time by giving
written notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires actual
knowledge of a conflict of interest in its capacity as Trustee that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain eligibility
requirements or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months
may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment by
the successor Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any
loss, liability, taxes (other than net income or similar taxes), expenses incurred without gross negligence, wilful
misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. Except as otherwise provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to request and rely conclusively and without further investigation upon Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of
Counsel in formulating its opinion or in taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices with respect to the Senior Secured Notes will be published on the website of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, the Company or any Parent of the Company. In addition, for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are
represented by Global Senior Secured Notes, notices to Holders of the Senior Secured Notes shall be delivered via
Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so mailed.
Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or other equivalent
means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice
or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a
notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee
receives it.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this “Description of the Senior Secured Notes,” the notice
requirements in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of Euroclear
and Clearstream for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are held as Global Senior Secured Notes. To the extent the
mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream conflict with any requirements applicable to notices under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, a notice will be deemed to satisfy such requirements if it complies with the
mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream concerning the content, timing and procedure for
delivering notices and otherwise complies with any applicable requirements under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium,
if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior Secured
Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

346


-----

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Sterling-Denominated Restrictions**

Sterling is the required currencies (the “Required Currency”) of account and payment for all sums payable
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the
related Notes Guarantees, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than the Required
Currency, whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the
winding-up or dissolution of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the
Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor in
connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the related Notes Guarantees will only constitute a discharge to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the amount of the Required Currency
which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of
that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is
practicable to do so).

If the amount of the Required Currency is less than the amount of the Required Currency expressed to be due
to the recipient or the Trustee under any Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors
will indemnify such recipient or the Trustee against any loss sustained by them as a result. In any event, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against
the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie
evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it
Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause
of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee (other
than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment,
order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Secured Note or any Notes
Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any sterlingdenominated restriction herein, (i) the Sterling Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a nonsterling currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such nonsterling amount is Incurred or paid, as the case may be and (ii) currency translations shall be made taking into account
any cross currency derivatives entered into by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Where
any such calculations involve the determination of a financial metric over a period of time, they shall be made
consistently with the exchange rate methodology applied in the financial statements included in this Offering
Memorandum or delivered pursuant to the covenant described under “—Reports” for the same period.

**Listing**

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited to list the Senior Secured
Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and to admit the Senior Secured Notes for trading on
the Exchange. There can be no assurance that any such listing will be granted or maintained.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, including judgments with respect to
the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and any purchase
price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors
will in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

Interest Expense will not be Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries following the Calculation Date;

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the
“144A Global Senior Secured Notes”).

The Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States to non-US persons in offshore transactions pursuant
to Regulation S under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes”). The 144A Global Senior
Secured Notes and the Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes are collectively referred to as the “Global Senior
**Secured Notes.”**

On the Issue Date, the Global Senior Secured Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes (“144A Book-Entry Interests”) and
ownership of interests in the Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests”
and, together with the 144A Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and
Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes on behalf of their participants through customers’
securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited
circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Book-Entry Interests for the
Senior Secured Notes will be issued only in denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess
thereof. The Group will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Senior Secured Notes; however, owners
of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts
in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit a
participant’s account on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems with the interest beneficially
owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require
that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form. The foregoing
limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Senior
Secured Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Senior Secured Notes registered
in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Senior Secured Notes in certificated form and will not be
considered the owners or “holders” of Senior Secured Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Senior Secured Notes are held in global form, the common depositary of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their respective nominees), as applicable, will be considered the sole holders of the Global Senior
Secured Notes for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. As such, participants must rely on the
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests to transfer their interests or to exercise
any rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

None of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Initial Purchasers, Registrar, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent,
and Senior Secured Notes Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture nor any of their respective agents will
have any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive
definitive registered Senior Secured Notes in certified form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”) only in the following
circumstances:

389


-----

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to
continue to act as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear
or Clearstream following an event of default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
enforcement action is being taken in respect thereof under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that upon request by an owner of a
Book- Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that Senior
Secured Notes Issuer issues or causes to be issued Senior Secured Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of
Book-Entry Interests and not only to the owner who made the initial request.

In such an event, the relevant Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or
names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream or the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions
received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered
Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, Paying
Agent, Transfer Agent and Registrar and their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any
Definitive Registered Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder
as such. Ownership of the Definitive Registered Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to time at the
registered office of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Senior
Secured Notes.

The Group will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a period
of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Senior Secured Notes, (ii) any date
fixed for redemption of the Senior Secured Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Senior Secured Notes to be
redeemed in part. The Group is also not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Senior Secured Notes
selected for redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered Note, the
Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Transfer Agent may require a holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Group may require a
holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
the Senior Secured Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered Notes
have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated and are surrendered
to the Registrar or at the office of the Transfer Agent, the Group will issue and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (or
an authenticating agent appointed by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee) will authenticate a replacement Definitive
Registered Note if the Senior Secured Notes Trustee’s and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s requirements are met.
The Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Secured Notes Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of
a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee and us to protect us, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent or the Paying Agent appointed pursuant to the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive Registered Note is replaced. The
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Registrar and/or Senior Secured Notes Trustee may charge for expenses in
replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about to
become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of the Senior
Secured Notes, the Group in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay, redeem or
purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in accordance
with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the Transfer Agent

390


-----

a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will
comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Senior Secured Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Redemption of the Global Senior Secured Notes**

In the event any Global Senior Secured Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or
Clearstream (or their respective nominee), as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the
Global Senior Secured Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Senior Secured
Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Senior Secured Note. The redemption
price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Senior Secured Note (or
any portion thereof). The Senior Secured Notes Issuer understands that under existing practices of Euroclear and
Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream
will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or
on such other basis (including by application of a pool factor) as they deem fair and appropriate in accordance with
their respective operational procedures; provided, however no Book-Entry Interest of less than £100,000 principal
amount may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Senior
Secured Notes (including principal, premium, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) to the Paying Agent
for onward payment to Euroclear and Clearstream. In turn, Euroclear and Clearstream will distribute such payments
to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer expects that standing
customer instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests
held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured
Notes Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar and any of their respective agents will treat the
registered holder of the Global Senior Secured Notes (i.e., the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (or
its nominee)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently,
none of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Registrar, the Transfer Agent, the
Paying Agent nor any of their respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

    - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear,
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments
made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest;

    - any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or
indirect participant; or

    - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street name.”

**Currency of Payment for the Global Senior Secured Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Senior Secured Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in pound
sterling.

Payments will be subject in all cases to laws and regulations (including any regulations of the applicable
clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor the Senior Secured Notes Trustee nor
the Initial Purchasers nor any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Senior Secured Note

391


-----

or any other person for any commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency
conversion or rounding effected in connection with any such payment.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that they will take any action
permitted to be taken by a holder of the Senior Secured Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to
whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes are credited and only in respect of such
portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes as to which such participant or participants has
or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents,
waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the Global Senior Secured Notes. However, if there is an event
of default under the Senior Secured Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of the
Senior Secured Notes, reserves the right to exchange the Global Senior Secured Notes for Definitive Registered Notes
in certified form, and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with Euroclear and
Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive
Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Senior Secured Notes to persons in states which require physical
delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Senior
Secured Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the
provisions of each Indenture.

The Global Senior Secured Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice to Investors.”
Book-Entry Interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in
“Notice to Investors.” Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a beneficial
interest in the Regulation S Global Senior Secured Note upon receipt by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the
Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Note Indenture) from the
transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S. Regulation S Book-Entry
Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only upon
receipt by the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who
the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with any applicable state securities laws.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interests for a Rule 144A
Book-Entry Interest or vice versa, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount
of the Regulation S Global Senior Secured Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Rule
144A Global Senior Secured Note or vice versa.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global Senior
Secured Note only as described under “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange” and, if
required, only if the transferor first delivers to the Senior Secured Notes Trustee and the Transfer Agent a written
certificate (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply
with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such Senior Secured Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Senior Secured Notes that is transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Senior Secured Note will, upon transfer, cease to be
a Book-Entry Interest in the first mentioned Global Senior Secured Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the
other Global Senior Secured Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and
other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Senior Secured Note for as long as it retains
such a Book-Entry Interest.

392


-----

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers
of interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be,
they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the
Transfer Agent, the Registrar, the Paying Agent or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Pledges**

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a Book-Entry Interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of
such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions
require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer
beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer provides the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely
for the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Initial Purchasers,
the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent, the Registrar nor any of their respective
agents are responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organisations. They also facilitate the clearance
and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes
in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including
the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities.
Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are
financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other
organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers
and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream
participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect
participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or
entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such
interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that
certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial
interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream
systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes only through Euroclear or
Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Senior Secured Notes represented by the Global Senior Secured Notes are expected to be listed on the
Official List of the Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes between participants in
Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system’s rules and
operating procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers
of interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under no
obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued or modified

393


-----

at any time. None of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Initial Purchaser, the Senior Secured Notes Trustee, the
Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent or the Registrar will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear,
Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Senior Secured Notes will be made in Sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream
holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of trading
of any Book- Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure that settlement
can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and other
communications involving the Senior Secured Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems
are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing transactions
involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States. U.S. investors who wish to
transfer their interests in the Senior Secured Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery of Senior Secured
Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business day in
Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**Clearing Information**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer expects that the Senior Secured Notes will be accepted for clearance through
the facilities of Euroclear and Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers, common codes and
CUSIP numbers for the Senior Secured Notes are set out under “Listing and General Information.”

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

The following is a brief description of certain limitations on the validity and enforceability of the Notes
Guarantees and security interests for the Senior Secured Notes and of certain aspects of insolvency law in each of the
jurisdictions in which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of security in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes are organised, or certain key jurisdictions in which Collateral is held. In the event that any one
or more of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors, the providers of security in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes or any other of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s subsidiaries experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible
to know with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced,
or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and the providers of security to the Senior Secured Notes. The
descriptions below are only a summary and do not purport to be complete or discuss all of the limitations or
considerations that may affect the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees or other security interests. The
application of various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply
and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect payment in full under the Senior Secured
Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable. Prospective investors in the Senior Secured Notes should
consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and considerations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to Our Capital Structure and the Senior Secured Notes.”_

**England and Wales**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, certain of the Guarantors and certain of the providers of Collateral are
companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the “English Obligors”).

**_Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts_**

While the United Kingdom (“UK”) was a member state of the EU, insolvency processes opened in the UK
were subject to both EU and applicable UK domestic legislation. Following the UK’s departure from the EU on
January 31, 2020 and the expiry of the subsequent transition period (the “Transition Period”) on December 31, 2020,
in accordance with the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal
Agreement) Act 2020) EU law as directly applicable in the UK at the end of the Transition Period (subject to certain
exceptions) was transposed into UK domestic law subject to significant amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment)
(EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) (as amended) effected key amendments to both EU insolvency laws
previously directly applicable in the UK, including the EC Regulation No. 2015/848 on Insolvency Proceedings (the
“Recast Insolvency Regulation”) (which, as it applies to the UK, is to be read as a reference to such EU regulation
as it forms part of domestic law), and domestic insolvency laws, including the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “Insolvency
**Act”), the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016 (SI 2016/1024) (the “Insolvency Rules”) and the Cross-Border**
Insolvency Regulations 2006 (SI 2006/1030) (the “Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations”).

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the
Transition Period, in which case the unmodified Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation
govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligors would likely proceed under, and
be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However,
to the extent that an English Obligor has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”) in a member state of the EU, main
insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be
opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, certain foreign
courts may accept jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of an English Obligor where the relevant
jurisdictional thresholds are met for that jurisdiction.

Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings
available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect
of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark)
and an “establishment” in the UK or which is incorporated in an EEA Member State. While this allows English courts
to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of
such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings

395


-----

in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring
_proceedings”)._

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Senior Secured
Notes are guaranteed by the Notes Guarantees and secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency
laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the payment obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
in respect of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and of a Notes
Guarantee against an English Obligor and of the security interests over the Collateral.

The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such limitations.
The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, and their ability to enforce their rights for payment of
the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and/or under the Notes Guarantees
and/or under the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees and therefore may limit the
amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Obligor.

**_Fixed versus floating charges_**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees benefit from fixed and floating charge security over
certain Collateral owned by certain of the English Obligors.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security.

Until floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating
charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the
charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge.

On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge,
may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge had not
crystallised at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security
which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of insolvency
office-holders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration)
properly incurred in an insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including
the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency office-holders appointed to a
charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses
in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured
assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full and in each case provided that the floating charge is
not created or does not otherwise arise under a financial collateral arrangement (see below); (c) an administrator may
dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder
or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of
the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a
“financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or
tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2)
Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”), assets subject to floating
charge security are subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part
for unsecured creditors (see “—Priority on insolvency” below); and (e) there are particular insolvency “clawback”
risks in relation to floating charge security. A floating charge cannot crystallise upon or following entry of the charging
company into a Part A1 Moratorium (as defined below), and charge holders are prevented from imposing restrictions
on the disposal of the charged assets for the duration of the Part A1 Moratorium (see “—Limitation on enforcement—
_Moratoriums” below)._

There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that fixed security interests expressed to be
created by a security document governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description
given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as
fixed security interests rather than recharacterised as floating security interests will depend, among other things, on
whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s ability to deal with the

396


-----

relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice.
Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its
discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question
constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Administration_**

English insolvency statutes empower English courts to make an administration order in respect of any
company within their general jurisdiction (see “—Applicable legal framework and jurisdiction of the English courts”),
any company incorporated in England and Wales or an EEA country (an “EEA State”), any company (irrespective of
its country of incorporation) with its COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other than Denmark), and upon request
from courts in other parts of the UK or certain other countries and territories. In each case and subject to specific
conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to
become “unable to pay its debts” (although this requirement does not apply if the applicant is a holder of a “qualifying
floating charge” (discussed below)) and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of
administration.

A company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its
debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the
amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), in each case under Section 123
of the Insolvency Act. “Cash flow” insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy
a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a
judgment debt (or similar court order).

The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively:
rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the
company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is
reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising
property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to
any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on insolvency”).

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, the debtor company, the directors of such company or
the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as described in “—Qualifying floating charge”) where the floating charge
has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court. Different appointment procedures apply
according to the identity of the appointor.

An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed
and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration
(including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realisation of any property
subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for the satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the
ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “—Prescribed Part”). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the
court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose
of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the
obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. An administrator may also dispose of property of a company
subject to a fixed charge with the consent of the relevant fixed charge holder(s).

In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon
the appointment of an administrator, any existing Part A1 Moratorium (see “—Moratoriums”) will come to an end, a
statutory moratorium is imposed such that no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s
property except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court. The same requirements for consent or
permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress
and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary
factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration
described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order
has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from
such time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of
an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed

397


-----

by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed
by the company or directors).

However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to
realise their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by
virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a
“financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

If an English company was to enter administration, while that company was in administration it would not
be possible to, without permission of the court or consent of the administrator, to enforce any security granted by that
company unless such security constituted a financial collateral arrangement. A demand for payment could be made
under any guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against the company in
connection therewith without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

Accordingly, if any English Obligors were to enter into administration, the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes
Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, may not be enforceable (save to the extent that the Collateral constitutes
a financial collateral arrangement) without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator while the
relevant company was in administration. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the
Security Agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

**_Qualifying floating charge_**

If a company grants security constituting a “qualifying floating charge” to a party for the purposes of English
insolvency law, that party will be able to appoint an administrator out of court (see “—Administration”) or (in limited
circumstances) an administrative receiver (see “—Administrative Receivership”). The holder of a qualifying floating
charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to appoint an administrator,
allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in
place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms of
appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into administration.

A floating charge constitutes a qualifying floating charge if it is created by an instrument which (a) states
that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (being paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act), (b)
purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company, or (c) purports to empower the holder to
appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be
the holder of a qualifying floating charge if such floating charge security, together (if necessary) with other forms of
security granted to that party, relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the property of the relevant company,
and at least one such security interest is a qualifying floating charge. Please note that exclusion of assets from the
scope of the floating charge may impact the analysis of whether the chargee is a “holder of a qualifying floating charge
in respect of a company’s property.” It is a matter of fact whether the extent of the security granted relates to ‘the
whole or substantially the whole’ of the property of a company and there is no statutory guidance as to what percentage
of a company’s assets should be charged to satisfy this test.

**_Administrative receivership_**

Administrative receivership as a creditor remedy has been largely abolished and is only available in very
limited circumstances. The ability to appoint an administrative receiver only applies to holders of a qualifying floating
charge where either the security document granting such charge pre-dates September 15, 2003 or where it falls within
one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act (as amended by the Enterprise Act 2002) to the prohibition on the
appointment of administrative receivers. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an
administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements,” which may apply if the issue of the
Senior Secured Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the
arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in paragraph
1 of Schedule 2A of the Insolvency Act and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments and debt instruments
designed to be rated, listed or traded). An administrative receiver cannot be appointed to a company which is subject
to a Part A1 Moratorium (see “—Moratoriums”).

398


-----

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and
not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and
then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security
pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue,
a preference or an invalid floating charge (see “—Jersey—Transactions at an undervalue,” “—Jersey—Preferences”
and “—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an Obligor’s insolvency
_is within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee (including the Notes_
_Guarantees and the Collateral) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or any other related transaction would not be_
_challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid—Voidable floating charge”). If an administrator is_
appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office.

**_Fixed charge receivership_**

A fixed charge receiver (as opposed to an administrative receiver, who is appointed under certain floating
charges - see “—Administrative receivership”) may be appointed over some or all of the assets secured by a fixed
charge in accordance with the terms of a security document creating a fixed charge or (in limited circumstances)
pursuant to statute under section 101 of the Law of Property Act 1925, although it is standard market practice to
augment the powers of any receiver appointed through the relevant security document.

If appointed pursuant to the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the
charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an
appointment to take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such and a fixed
charge receivership can be run in parallel to a liquidation or an administration. However, an administrator may require
a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or
otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement,” as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral
Regulations (see “—Administration” above).

The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning
(s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor, although certain limited duties are also owed to the chargor.
This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors
as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In
realising the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the
circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities
from the realisations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity
from the appointor).

To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be deducted
from the proceeds of the realisation of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see
“—Prescribed Part”).

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Although not an insolvency proceeding, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts
have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects an arrangement or compromise between a company
and its members or creditors (or any class of its members or creditors). An English Obligor may be able to propose a
scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign Obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the
Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also propose a scheme. In practice,
a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied
where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law
governed or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by
English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will
not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors and/or members will
vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors/members that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights
that such creditors/members and are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or

399


-----

its creditors (although in practice a creditor-led scheme would nonetheless require the cooperation of the company or
its insolvency officeholder). If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors/members
present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors/members vote in favour of the proposed scheme,
irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject
to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors/members, including those affected creditors/members
who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned
by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is
reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional
upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme. In exercising its discretion to sanction a scheme of
a foreign Obligor, the court will likely refuse to sanction a scheme for an unregistered company where to do so would
not be likely to serve any real purpose. Whether the effect of the scheme will be recognised in the jurisdiction of
incorporation of a foreign company or a company with its COMI in a foreign jurisdiction will depend on the
jurisdiction in question. The English court has previously sanctioned schemes where expert evidence was provided
showing that the scheme of arrangement (or its effect) is likely to have effect in such jurisdictions. However, each
case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine
whether or not this test would be satisfied in any given case. Once sanctioned, the scheme of arrangement binds all
affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the scheme of arrangement, which shall be effective (in
accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement to the Registrar
of Companies.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically
trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings. A company may, however, propose a scheme of arrangement while
subject to a Part A1 Moratorium which may remain in place until sanctioning of the scheme (see “—Moratoriums”).

**_Restructuring plan_**

Like a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan is a procedure under the Companies Act 2006, namely
Part 26A thereof, which allows the English courts to effect a compromise of a company’s liabilities between a
company and its members or creditors (or any class of its members or creditors), but with the added possibility of a
‘cross-class cram-down’ to bind dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan proposed. While generally available
to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a
restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that
are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or
arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors and its member (or any class of them) whose
purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties. Save as set
out above, there are no financial eligibility criteria, thereby making it available to both solvent and insolvent companies
(in the latter case, the plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency office holder). Where a convening
application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium (see below), any creditors in
respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” (see “—Moratorium”) may not participate in the
vote and may not be compromised under the restructuring plan without their consent.

A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor or member of the company or any
liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. The consent of the company (or its insolvency officeholder) is
required if the plan is proposed by a creditor or shareholder. The process closely resembles that for schemes of
arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to
convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court
will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring
plan.

As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors and members will vote on the proposed compromise or
arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such
creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given
under the restructuring plan. Creditors/Members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement
must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is satisfied that they
have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference to the “relevant
alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the
restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors/members whose rights are not being compromised under

400


-----

the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for
excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has
jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the proposed
restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details
of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company.

A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors/members present
and voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors/members vote in favour of the proposed compromise. There
is no requirement for the approving creditors/members to constitute a majority in number of those creditors/members
present and voting.

Following approval of the restructuring plan at the relevant meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be
sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory conditions
have been met and may also consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as
to whether to sanction the restructuring plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or
members did not vote in favour of it, thereby “cramming down” dissenting classes provided that the court is satisfied
that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the restructuring plan were to be sanctioned
than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ and (b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least
one class of creditors/members who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in
the event of the ‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes of this assessment is whatever the
court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned.
By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’,
meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors/members do not
vote in favour of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes.

The court also has discretion to make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to
sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights
will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the
court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies or, where the company is an overseas
company, publication of the court’s order in the Gazette.

As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically
trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings but a company may propose a restructuring plan while subject to a Part
A1 Moratorium. Any such Part A1 Moratorium may remain in place until sanctioning of the restructuring plan.

**_Company voluntary arrangement_**

English courts are empowered to oversee company voluntary arrangements in respect of (i) companies
incorporated under the Companies Act 2006 (or the preceding legislation) in England and Wales, (ii) companies
incorporated in an EEA State or (iii) companies with their respective COMI in the UK or an EU member state (other
than Denmark).

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as
applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails
a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of
the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision
procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal or who would have been
entitled to vote if they had notice of the decision procedure. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the rights
of a secured creditor or a preferential creditor, except with its consent.

In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75%
(by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of
unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement,
however, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that its claims are unsecured. A secured creditor who proves in the
company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. The company’s
members will also be asked to vote on the CVA (and will be considered approved if more than 50% in value of the
company’s members present in person or by proxy and voting at a meeting on the resolution approve the company

401


-----

voluntary arrangement). However, if the company’s creditors approve the proposal, the CVA will be implemented
notwithstanding a vote against by the members. Anyone entitled to vote on the proposal may apply to the court to
challenge the approval of a company voluntary arrangement in certain circumstances.

Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not automatically trigger a
moratorium of claims or proceedings. A company may, however, enter into a Part A1 Moratorium (see “—
_Moratoriums”) prior to or while undergoing a company voluntary arrangement process which will terminate upon_
creditor approval of the proposed arrangement.

**_Liquidation/winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realised and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors in the statutory order of priority prescribed by the Insolvency Act (see “—
_Priority on insolvency”). Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the_
Register of Companies.

There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’
voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save
where it follows an administration).

Companies registered in England and Wales or foreign companies with their COMI in England and Wales,
with their COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in England and Wales or which
have a “sufficient connection” with England and Wales to justify the court exercising its jurisdiction may be wound
up via compulsory liquidation. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject to voluntary
liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in an EU member state (except
Denmark) (but which has an “establishment” in England and Wales) may enter a creditors’ voluntary liquidation).

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up.
In a compulsory winding up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s
property made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will
not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial
collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision
taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of
a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding up petition.
Once a winding up order is made by the court, any existing Part A1 Moratorium (see “—Moratoriums”) will come to
an end and a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued
or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose
although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security.

The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is whether the directors of the company are willing to
swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months (if so, the process is a
members’ voluntary liquidation) which must be done not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding-up
resolution. The primary ground for the creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to
pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act - see “—Administration”) and there is no need for the
directors to swear a statutory declaration of solvency (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). Note that
while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the
members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors.

In the context of a voluntary winding up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no
equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary
winding-up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the
continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. Any existing Part A1 Moratorium will terminate upon
commencement of a voluntary winding-up. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for
example, can initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security).

402


-----

On the appointment of a liquidator, the directors’ powers to bind the company automatically cease, save for
those powers that are sanctioned by the liquidator or creditors (as appropriate). A liquidator has, among other things,
the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as
far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property (provided that in respect of the sale
of any property that is secured by a fixed charge in favour of a creditor, if that sale is made without the secured
creditor’s consent, it will be made subject to that security, as the creditor’s consent will be needed to the release of the
security), and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “—
_Avoidance of Transactions”)._

**_Priority on insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going concern,
one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realise the assets of the company in question
and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company’s creditors.

Under and in accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different
classes, with the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of
priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot
be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless
creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are
distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class.

As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being
taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance
owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing
administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as of the date of liquidation or the date on which the
administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is
that the creditor receives full value for its claim to the extent of the amount that it owes the company (in circumstances
where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim).
However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst
other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must
exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual
agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before
the time at which insolvency set-off applies).

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

    - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets_
covers that indebtedness) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full
legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to the assets in which they have a
proprietary interest;

    - _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate e.g. any prescribed fees or expenses of the official_
receiver, moratorium debts, (in certain circumstances) certain “priority pre-moratorium debts” and
expenses of the liquidation or administration (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of
priority in which expenses are paid);

    - _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors._

Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in
relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of
employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per
person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the
termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible
for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit.
As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally;

403


-----

Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and
include (but are not limited to) claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE
income tax, employee NI contributions, student loan repayments and Construction Industry Scheme
deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions which are held by the company
on behalf of employees and customers), as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 of
the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally;

    - _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would_
include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which,
on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset
realisations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to
certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors;

    - _Fifth ranking:_

      - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under
section 74(2(f)) of the Insolvency Act) and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured
creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of
commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These debts rank equally among themselves
unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them. To pay the secured
creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency office-holder can only use realisations from
unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part
unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor
elects to surrender its security;

      - secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual
rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum))
in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation (or any preceding administration,
where applicable) or administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under
the Senior Secured Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes may, if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of
such security recoveries; and

      - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above
and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; and

    - _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds_
exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the
subordination language in the relevant documentation.

Where the debtor company enters into administration or winding-up proceedings within 12 weeks of the end
of a Part A1 Moratorium, certain moratorium-related debts will benefit from ‘super priority’ and will rank immediately
following the first ranking debts, and ahead of the second ranking debts, set out above. The relevant debts comprise
prescribed fees and expenses of any official receiver, debts incurred during the Part A1 Moratorium and priority
pre-moratorium debts (see “—Moratoriums”).

**_Prescribed Part_**

An insolvency officeholder of a company (e.g. an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will
generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for
the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating
charge realisations) (the “Prescribed Part”). This ring-fence applies to (a) 50% of the first £10,000 of the company’s
net property and (b) 20% of the remainder of the company’s net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate
cap of £800,000 (except where the company’s net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking
floating charge created before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed

404


-----

Part must be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the
resulting benefit to creditors. The Prescribed Part will not be available for any shortfall claims of secured creditors.

The requirement of the insolvency officeholder to set aside a Prescribed Part will not apply to any charge
created or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**_Foreign currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claim for their debts, the
office-holder will convert all foreign currency denominated proofs of debt into pound sterling at a single rate for each
currency determined by the office-holder by reference to the exchange rates prevailing on the date when the company
went into liquidation or administration (or where a liquidation was immediately preceded by an administration, the
rate prevailing on the date that the company entered administration). This provision overrides any agreement between
the parties. If a creditor considers the rate to be unreasonable, it may apply to the court.

Accordingly, in the event that an English Obligor goes into liquidation or administration, holders of the
Senior Secured Notes may be subject to exchange rate risk between the date on which such English Obligor goes into
liquidation or administration and receipt of any amounts to which such holders of the Senior Secured Notes may
become entitled. Any losses resulting from currency fluctuations are not recoverable from the insolvent estate.

**_Avoidance of transactions_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by a company of security and/or
guarantees or the entry by a company into a transaction can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the
company is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period after the relevant act. Therefore, if
during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English company, the administrator or
liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by such company, or certain transactions
entered into by the company. Further, the administrator or liquidator may elect to assign such a right of action
(including their proceeds) to another party who would then be entitled to pursue it.

There are five principal provisions of the Insolvency Act under which transactions entered into prior to a
company’s insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii)
preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding
creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244).

These provisions all apply where the company has gone into an English liquidation or administration, with
the exception of section 423 which can be invoked even if the company is not in insolvency proceedings.

**_The Senior Secured Notes Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an Obligor’s insolvency is_**
**_within any of the requisite time periods, the grant of a security interest and/or guarantee (including the Notes_**
**_Guarantees and the Collateral) in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or any other related transaction would not_**
**_be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction as valid._**

_Onset of insolvency_

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid
floating charges (as discussed below) depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise,
the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency
is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company
passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be
the same as for the initial administration.

405


-----

_Connected persons_

If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the
company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any
challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below).

A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions
at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow
director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or
civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s
husband, wife or civil partner.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company (and in this case, directors of a
company are treated as employees of that company). A person is also an associate of any person whom he employs.
A company is an associate of another person if that person has control of it or if that person and persons who are his
associates together have control of it.

A company is associated with another company if i) the same person has control of both companies, or ii) a
person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control
of the other, or iii) if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist of the
same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of
either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company
which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he
is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the
company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these
conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest or
guarantee granted by or any transaction entered into by the English Obligors include, without limitation, the following
described below.

_Transactions at an undervalue_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside
the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or other relevant transaction), or grant other relief where the creation
of such security interest or guarantee (or other relevant transaction) constituted a transaction at an undervalue.

A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence
of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123
of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if it took place within the relevant time (two years before
the onset of the company’s insolvency). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the
company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see “—Connected
_persons”), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the_
company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction and did not become unable to do so as a
consequence of the transaction.

A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the
company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or
money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied
that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at
the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it.

406


-----

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order
as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which
may include reducing payments due under the guarantees or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by
the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether
or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice
any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or
prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the
transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where
the person was a party to the transaction.

_Preferences_

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside
payments, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or other relevant transaction), or grant other relief, where
such payment, creation of security interest or guarantee (or other relevant transaction) constituted a preference.

A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction,
the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency
Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into insolvency within a period of six months (if the
beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected
person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from
the date the company enters into the transaction. A transaction may constitute a preference if the company does
something or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has the effect of putting a creditor of the
company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the
company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had
that thing not been done. However, a court shall not make an order unless the company which entered into the
transaction was influenced by a desire to put that person in a preferential position when taking their decision.

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its
debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of
the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being
the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the
connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them.
The desire to prefer requires a positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s insolvent
liquidation. A preferential effect for a creditor may be foreseen by the company without being desired.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to
restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include
reducing payments due under or setting aside the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Collateral and any
other security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any
obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will
not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for
value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit
from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except
where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the
company.

_Transactions defrauding creditors_

Under English insolvency law, where a transaction was at an undervalue and the court is satisfied that it was
made for the substantial purpose (it does not need to be the sole purpose) of putting assets beyond the reach of a person
who is making, or may make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a
person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court
as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the
transaction including the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK
Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and use of the
provision is therefore not limited to liquidators or administrators. The Insolvency Act does not prescribe a set time

407


-----

limit within which to bring the action and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a
result of, the transaction.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such
order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to
protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside
the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Collateral and any other security interests or guarantees. The
relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the
person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property
which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the
relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for
value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company
unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate Credit Transactions_

An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction
is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either i) the terms of it are (or
were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies)
in respect of the provision of the credit or ii) it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. It is
presumed, unless otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with respect to which an
administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside an extortionate credit transaction in extortionate.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to
three years before the day on which a company entered administration or liquidation (which is slightly different to the
concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences). That order may
set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of
sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction.
The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under
the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted
that there are no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction
(e.g. assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it).

_Voidable floating charges_

Under section 245 of the Insolvency Act, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year
prior to the entry by the company into an English insolvency process (or two years in the case of a floating charge in
favour of a connected person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to do so as a
consequence of the transaction (within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act) will be invalid, except to
the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to; (b) the goods or services supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction
of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain
interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for a company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of granting
the floating charge or to become insolvent as a consequence of doing so does not apply where the floating charge is
granted to a connected person.

An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a
floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is
automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration.

However, if the floating charge is created or otherwise arising under a “security financial collateral
arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as
described in “Administration” above.

If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid, then it will not be possible for the holder of that charge to
appoint an administrator out of court or through the in-court route for qualifying floating charge holders or (if the
holder would otherwise have been entitled to appoint an administrative receiver but for the floating charge being held
invalid), to appoint an administrative receiver.

408


-----

_Recharacterisation of fixed charges_

As referred to above (see “—Fixed versus floating charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being
recharacterised as a floating charge. If purported fixed security that is subsequently recharacterised has been granted
within the suspect period referred to above (see “—Voidable floating charges”), this could render the charge invalid
except to the value of the Consideration.

_Disclaimer_

An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other
property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any
other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise
to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may be detrimental to
creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company
could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power to disclaim onerous property does not apply
to an executed contract insofar as it has been performed, nor can it, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of
releasing the company from any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. Any person suffering loss
or damage in consequence of the operation of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and may prove
for the loss or damage in the winding-up.

**_Security over shares_**

Security over shares of an English company granted by an English Obligor or over shares of an English
Obligor are, under English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a charging
company creates an encumbrance over the property in favour of the chargee and/or transfers the beneficial interest in
the property to the chargee but the charging company retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable
charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion of the court.

The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may
additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured
parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English
company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.

**_Security over bank accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an “Account Charge”) granted by an English Obligor,
the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an “Account Bank”) may have reserved their right at any
time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallisation event under the Account Charge) to exercise the rights
of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other arrangements with that English Obligor.
As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral
constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off
with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised
and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with
respect to the relevant English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral
will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights unless the Account Bank has
expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances.

**_Limitations on enforcement_**

_Constitutional documents, corporate benefit and financial assistance_

The grant of a Notes Guarantee or Collateral by any of the English Obligors in respect of the obligations of
another group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. Among other requirements, such a transaction must
be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents
do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found
to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they

409


-----

are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its
interpretation.

Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its entry
into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that
he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members
as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be
found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court.
Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to
consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when
this shift arises, the UK Supreme Court has held that it takes place when the company in question is either insolvent
or is bordering on insolvency or an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable.

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the
extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law.

_Security registration_

Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document
pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security governed
by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the
Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest (the
“Registration Period”). While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies
to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator,
administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the Registration Period.
When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become
immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify
a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the Registration Period has expired.

The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with
the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly does
not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset registries may
still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets.

_Moratoriums_

As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the
automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable
to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees.

Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “—Administration”) or
liquidation (see “—Liquidation/winding-up”), a standalone moratorium procedure is also available (under Part A1 of
the Insolvency Act) as introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA 2020”) to any
company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act (subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite
conditions). Companies that are ineligible for the standalone moratorium include certain financial services companies
(including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitisation companies as well as parties to any agreement which
is or forms part of a “capital market arrangement” (including the grant of security or a guarantee) under which a party
has incurred, or when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £10 million (at any time
during the life of the capital market arrangement), where the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market
investment). This includes, among other things, secured and unsecured debt that is rated, listed, traded (or designed to
be rated, listed or traded), or bonds or commercial paper issued to certain professional, high net worth or sophisticated
investors. Other exclusions are set out in Schedule ZA1 to the Insolvency Act. The English Obligors are likely to fall
outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital
markets arrangement exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Business and Trade may modify the criteria by
reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as
to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from time to time.

_Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_

Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto
clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency
procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow
suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the
contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under
the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’
(i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation, a moratorium under
Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be
unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant office-holder consents to the termination
or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the
supplier hardship.

The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the
provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees,
contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of,
arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act).

**_Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings_**

_General position_

The recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings in other jurisdictions is governed by
applicable treaties in respect of the mutual recognition (or otherwise) of courts’ jurisdiction, proceedings and
judgments and general principles of private international law such as comity and conflicts of laws rules applicable in
the relevant jurisdictions.

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the
“Model Law”), which was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for
recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if
the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI
is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by
the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model
Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border
Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main
proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main
proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are
restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction
of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of
Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention 2005”), where applicable. As of January 15, 2024, the UK
Government has signed the Hague Convention of 2 July 2019 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign
Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters (the “Hague Convention 2019”), which will come into force 12 months
after ratification and apply to judgments in proceedings commenced after that date. In addition, recognition may still
be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”).

The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing
area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters
relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague
Convention 2005 (or the Hague Convention 2019), or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and
restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties.

411


-----

_Recognition in the EU_

Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer
benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed
between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK
insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border
insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and
increased complexity.

Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached and becomes effective in the future, it is likely to
be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states and for
UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states than when the UK was a member state
of the EU. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law
rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing
the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in
reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be
recognised in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of
contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states.

As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU
member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member
state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognised and
whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.

**Scotland**

None of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Scotland. The Scottish security is limited to fixed
security over real estate located in Scotland and is provided by Guarantors incorporated under the laws of England
and Wales. We therefore refer you to the English law sections above in relation to security and guarantees granted by
English Guarantors in all respects, save for those specifically dealt with below in relation to Scottish fixed security.

In Scotland, forms of fixed security are closely tied to specific types of property. Since Scots law does not
recognise the English law concept of “equity” there is more focus on the legal formalities rather than the intention of
the parties with respect to the creation of fixed security interests. Scots law does not have a concept of
recharacterisation of fixed security as a floating charge (as detailed in “—Fixed versus floating charges”) and so if the
strict legal requirements under Scots law are not met, there will be no security over the relevant assets notwithstanding
the intention of the parties.

In respect of movable property, it is essential that the security holder has some form of possession (which
may take different forms) over the subject in order to create a valid fixed security interest. Scots law does not
differentiate between legal and equitable ownership of property so, for instance, in order to create a security interest
over shares in companies incorporated in Scotland, the security holder (or its nominee) must be registered as the
shareholder. Furthermore, as there is no Scottish equivalent of an English law equitable assignment, a Scottish interest
in incorporeal property will only be created when the assignation is properly notified to the relevant parties.

Fixed charges over land and buildings situated in Scotland may only be created using a “standard security”
(which is the Scots law equivalent of a legal mortgage over an interest of land and is governed by statute, including in
relation to how the security must be enforced).

Scots law does not recognise the office of receiver except in the specific instance of a receiver appointed by,
or on the application of, the holder of a floating charge created as such by a company with such appointments or
applications being subject to the restrictions noted in the sections above relating to English Guarantors (see in
particular “—Administrative receivership”). Rather, enforcement of a standard security over land and buildings in
Scotland is by a procedure called ‘calling up’ which requires a prescribed form notice to be given to the granter of the
security (and certain other prescribed parties) providing the debtor with a two-month period to make repayment of the
secured liabilities referred to in the notice (the two-month period can be shortened in certain circumstances). Where
the secured property is used to any extent for residential purposes, additional requirements need to be complied with

412


-----

including a pre-action protocol and an application to Court. Calling up only entitles the secured creditor to advertise
and sell the property secured by the standard security. It does not provide the secured creditor with control over, or,
any rights in relation to the wider assets of the debtor and/or its business carried on from the property. The process
also exposes the secured creditor to potential liabilities. In an insolvency situation, the insolvency practitioner would
usually sell the property secured by the standard security with the consent of the secured creditor. However, in the
absence of insolvency proceedings, calling up would be the route through which the secured creditor would require to
enforce its standard security.

Whilst a liquidator appointed in England has the power to disclaim onerous contracts and property, the
position is not settled whether a liquidator under English law governed insolvency proceedings can disclaim onerous
heritable property situated in Scotland on the basis the concept of disclaimer does not exist under Scots law.

**Northern Ireland**

**_Insolvency_**

We understand there are no obligors incorporated under the laws of Northern Ireland, and that an analysis of
the insolvency laws of Northern Ireland is not required. However, certain Collateral over assets situate in Northern
Ireland will be provided by companies who are incorporated in England (each a “NI-Related Security Provider”).
Therefore, any insolvency proceedings with respect to such NI-Related Security Providers are likely to be governed
by the laws of England and Wales, save where the enforcement results in the appointment of a fixed asset receiver
over real property situate in Northern Ireland.

The Collateral over real property assets situate in Northern Ireland will be subject to the laws of Northern
Ireland. It will therefore be subject to the provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Acts 1881 and 1911,
and will when drafted also incorporate the powers of a receiver contained in the Insolvency (NI) Order 1989, such
powers being identical to those contained in the Insolvency Act 1986.

It should be noted that the Law of Property Act 1925, which is an English statute, is not applicable in Northern
Ireland.

**_Fixed Versus Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security granted by a NI-Related Provider has an advantage
over floating charge security: (a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can (without the floating charge
holder’s consent) convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use cash subject to a floating charge, to
meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging
company) while in administration in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if
created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against the floating charge over the charged assets;
(c) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of a liquidator) properly incurred in a winding-up are
payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets the subject of the floating charge) in priority
to floating charge claims; (d) until the floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets
that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be
effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating
charge and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge
security; (e) there are particular challenges / risks in relation to floating charge security; and (f) floating charge security
is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme contributions and wages/ salaries
(including holiday pay) owed to employees); from December 1, 2020 secondary preferential creditors in respect of
VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC and to ring fencing.

Under insolvency laws in Northern Ireland, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security
interests expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges because the description
given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed rather
than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the chargee has the requisite degree of
control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether
such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without

413


-----

the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge,
notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Limitation on enforcement_**

As indicated above by reference to England and Wales, any security granted by a NI-Related Security
Provider (including security governed by the laws of Northern Ireland) (together with prescribed particulars of the
relevant security) should ordinarily be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after
the date of creation of the relevant security interest. We therefore refer you to the English law sections above in relation
to security and guarantees granted by English Guarantors in all respects, noting that the NI-Related Security Providers
are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.

**_Foreign currency_**

The lawful currency in Northern Ireland is pound sterling. Northern Ireland, unlike the Republic of Ireland,
does not have euro as its currency.

Under insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claims for their debts, any debt
of a company payable in a currency other than pound sterling must be converted into pound sterling at the “official
exchange rate” prevailing at the date when the company went into liquidation or administration (if the administration
was immediately preceded by a winding-up, on the date the company went into liquidation). This provision overrides
any agreement between the parties. The “official exchange rate” for these purposes is the middle exchange rate on the
London Foreign Exchange Market at close of business, as published for the date in question or, if no such rate is
published, such rate as the court determines.

**Jersey**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the security providers may be incorporated under the laws of Jersey. Consequently, in the event of
an insolvency of any Jersey incorporated security provider insolvency proceedings may be initiated in Jersey. There
are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: désastre and winding-up. The désastre procedure in
respect of a Jersey company may be instigated by the Jersey Financial Services Commission, an eligible creditor or
the company making an application for an Act of the Royal Court (“Royal Court”) of Jersey under the Bankruptcy
(Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the “Jersey Bankruptcy Law”) declaring the property of a debtor to be
“en désastre” (a “declaration”). On a declaration of désastre, title and possession of the property of the debtor vest
automatically in the Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the “Viscount”). With effect from the date of declaration,
a creditor has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence or, except with
the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt.

A secured party may, however, without the consent of the Viscount and without an order of the Royal Court,
exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security Interests) of the Security
Interests (Jersey) Law 2012 (the “2012 Law”). To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to
discharge liabilities owed, that secured party has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor in
respect of the balance of the debt, and may not commence any legal proceedings or, except with the consent of the
Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the balance of the debt.

There are two forms of “creditors’ winding up” available in respect of a Jersey company pursuant to the
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, as amended (the “Jersey Companies Law”): (a) a court ordered procedure (a “court
**ordered creditors’ winding up”) which is instigated by an eligible creditor of the company making an application**
for an order of the Royal Court to commence a creditors’ winding up; and (b) a voluntary procedure (a “non-court
**ordered creditors’ winding up”) which is instigated by a special resolution of the shareholders of the company. On**
a creditors’ winding up, a liquidator is nominated by the applying creditor (in the case of a court ordered creditors’
winding up) or the shareholders (in the case of a non-court ordered creditors’ winding up). The court (in the case of a
court ordered creditors’ winding up) or the creditors (in the case of a non-court ordered creditors’ winding up) may
approve such a liquidator or appoint a different liquidator. In the case of a court ordered creditors’ winding up, the
Royal Court may also appoint a provisional liquidator in the intervening period between the initial application and the

414


-----

order to commence the creditors’ winding up. In the case of a court ordered creditors’ winding up, the liquidator
(including any liquidator appointed provisionally) must, within seven days of their appointment, give known creditors
notice calling a creditors’ meeting to be held 21 days’ after the date of the relevant order of the Royal Court and, in
the case of a non-court ordered creditors’ winding up, the shareholders must give creditors 14 days’ notice of the
meeting to commence the creditors’ winding up, with a meeting of creditors’ to be held immediately following such
commencement meeting. Any liquidator appointed provisionally will carry out such functions as conferred by, and
may have their powers limited by, the Royal Court. Once the creditors’ winding up has commenced, the liquidator
will stand in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of
assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the appointment of a liquidator provisionally or the
commencement of the creditors’ winding up, no action can be taken or proceeded with against the company except
with the leave of the Royal Court. A secured party may, however, without the sanction of a liquidator and without an
order of the Royal Court, exercise any power of enforcement it may have under Part 7 (Enforcement of Security
Interests) of the 2012 Law. To the extent that the proceeds of such enforcement are insufficient to discharge liabilities
owed, that secured party has no other remedy against the company, and may not, without leave of the Royal Court,
take or proceed with any other action to recover the balance of the debt. The corporate state and capacity of the
company continues until the end of the winding up procedure, when the company is dissolved.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, under Article 125 of the Jersey Companies Law, the Royal Court
may sanction a compromise or arrangement (a “Scheme”) between a company and its creditors or shareholders (or a
class of either of them). The Royal Court may, on application of the company (or a creditor or shareholder or, if the
company is being wound up, a liquidator), order a meeting to be called at which the Scheme will need to be agreed to
by a majority in number representing:

    - 75% in value of the creditors (or class of creditors); or

    - 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders (or class of shareholders),

as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy before the Royal Court considers the sanction of
the Scheme. If the requisite majority of creditors or shareholders (or of the relevant class of either of them) agree to
the Scheme and, following such agreement, the Royal Court sanctions the Scheme, the Scheme is binding on all
creditors or shareholders (or on the relevant class of either of them) and on the company (or any liquidator and
contributories of the company if the company is being wound up).

**_Transactions at an undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the Royal
Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en
_désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding-up), set aside a transaction (including any guarantee or_
security interest) entered into by a company with any person (the “other party”) at an undervalue. There is a five-year
look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding-up or declaration of “désastre” during which
transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law
and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what
constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the relevant time and the effect of entering into such a
transaction with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the company.

**_Preferences_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the Royal
Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en
_désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding-up), set aside a preference (including any guarantee or_
security interest) given by the company to any person (the “other party”). There is a 12-month look-back period from
the date of commencement of the winding-up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible
to examination pursuant to this rule (the “relevant time”). The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law
contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a preference, the operation

415


-----

of the relevant time and the effect of entering into a preference with a person connected with the company or with an
associate of the company.

**_Extortionate transactions, onerous property, disclaimer and customary law fraudulent dispositions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law, the Royal
Court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared “en
désastre”) or liquidator (in the case of a creditors’ winding-up), set aside a transaction providing credit to the debtor
company which is or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date of commencement of the
winding-up or declaration of “désastre” during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule.
The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation)
those that define what constitutes a transaction which is extortionate.

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date of
the declaration of “désastre” and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may within six months
following the commencement of a creditors’ winding-up, disclaim any onerous property of the company. “Onerous
**property” is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or other immoveable property if it is situated**
outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money
or perform any other onerous act, and includes an unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the “rights, interests and liabilities of the
company in or in respect of the property disclaimed” and “discharge the company from all liability in respect of the
property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors’ winding-up” but “shall not, except so far as is necessary
for the purpose of releasing the company/debtor, the company/debtor’s property and the Viscount from liability, affect
the rights or liabilities of any other person.” A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is deemed
to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing as a creditor in the désastre
or creditors’ winding-up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions,
including (without limitation) in relation to the power to disclaim onerous property.

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey
customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of defeating
creditors’ claims may be set aside.

**_Enforcement of security and security in insolvency_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have capacity
to grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the extent that any floating
charge or other security interest governed by a foreign law is expressed to apply to any asset, property and undertaking
of a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such floating charge or other security interest is not likely to
be held valid and enforceable by the Jersey courts in respect of Jersey situs assets.

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the
Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not part
of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Jersey courts may not recognise the powers of an administrator, administrative
receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets.

The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy
Law assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity, assist the courts
in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Royal Court thinks
fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law
has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey.

If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature
and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country’s insolvency
regime.

416


-----

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted that the UNCITRAL
provisions will not automatically be followed, as this is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. The Royal
Court’s position may also not be in accordance with EU Insolvency Regulation.

Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its directions.
Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law, and thus the automatic
test of centre of main interests does not apply.

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organisation or other laws of general application relating to or affecting the
rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at an undervalue, preference, extortionate credit transactions,
disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply in Jersey.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_Prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the_
_tax consequences, under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of a purchase of Senior Secured Notes_
_including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale or redemption_
_of, the Senior Secured Notes or any interest therein._

**UK Tax Considerations**

The following applies only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of Senior
Secured Notes and who hold Senior Secured Notes as a capital investment, and does not deal with certain classes of
persons (such as brokers or dealers in securities and persons connected with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) to whom
special rules may apply. The following is a summary of current UK law and published HMRC practice (which may
not be binding on HMRC) relating only to the UK withholding tax treatment of payments of interest in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes. The UK tax treatment of prospective noteholders depends on their individual circumstances
and may be subject to change in the future, possibly with retrospective effect.

This description does not purport to be a complete analysis of all UK tax considerations relating to the Senior
Secured Notes and does not constitute legal or tax advice. In particular, it does not address the UK tax consequences
of the sale, exchange, redemption, or other disposal of the Senior Secured Notes and does not discuss potentially
different consequences applicable to holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes that are redeemed with proceeds
from this Offering. Any prospective noteholders who are in doubt as to their own tax position, or who may be subject
to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom in respect of their acquisition, holding or disposal of the Senior
Secured Notes, should consult their professional advisers. In particular, holders of Senior Secured Notes should be
aware that they may be liable to tax under the laws of other jurisdictions in relation to payments in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes even if such payments may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of tax
under the laws of the United Kingdom.

References to “interest,” “discount” and “premium” in this section “Certain _Tax Considerations—UK Tax_
_Considerations” mean “interest,” “discount” and “premium” as understood in UK tax law. Those statements do not_
take any account of any different definitions of “interest,” “discount” or “premium” which may prevail under any
other law or which may be created by the terms and conditions of the Senior Secured Notes or any related
documentation.

**Interest on the Senior Secured Notes**

_UK withholding tax on interest_

Payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes may be made without withholding or deduction for or on
account of UK income tax provided that the Senior Secured Notes are and continue to be “listed” on a “recognised
stock exchange” within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the “Quoted Eurobond
**exemption”). The Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. The Senior Secured Notes will satisfy**
the requirements of the Quoted Eurobond exemption if they are officially listed on, and are admitted to trading on, the
Exchange in accordance with the rules of the Exchange. Provided, therefore, that the Senior Secured Notes are and
remain so listed, interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be payable without withholding or deduction for or on
account of UK tax.

In all cases falling outside the exemption described above, an amount must generally be withheld from
payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes on account of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%),
subject to such reliefs and/or exemptions as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation
treaty (following a direction from HMRC) or otherwise.

The Senior Secured Notes may be issued at a price that is less than their nominal amount. Any discount
element of the redemption amount will not be subject to withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income
tax.

418


-----

The Senior Secured Notes may be issued with a premium payable on redemption. Any premium payable on
redemption may be treated as a payment of interest for UK tax purposes and may accordingly be subject to the
withholding tax treatment described above.

_Payments by a Guarantor_

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Senior Secured Notes (or in respect of other
amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for such Senior Secured
Notes) such payments may be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%), subject to such relief
as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty (following a direction from HMRC)
or any other relief or exemption which may apply. Such payments by a Guarantor may not, however, be eligible for
the Quoted Eurobond exemption described in the paragraphs above.

_Further UK Tax Issues_

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes constitutes UK source income for UK tax purposes and may be subject
to UK income tax or corporation tax by direct assessment (including self-assessment) even where paid without
withholding or deduction. Accordingly, and subject to certain exceptions applying to various categories of investors
(including, in particular, exceptions applying to persons not resident in the United Kingdom), investors may be subject
to UK tax by direct assessment (including self-assessment) on such payments of interest even when paid without
withholding.

Persons in the United Kingdom paying interest to, or receiving interest on behalf of, another person may be
required to provide certain information to HMRC regarding the identity of the payee or the person entitled to the
interest. In certain circumstances, such information may be exchanged with tax authorities in other countries.

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax_**

No UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax should be payable on the issue of the Senior Secured Notes. No
stamp duty or SDRT will be payable on a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes provided that (i) the interest on the
Senior Secured Notes does not exceed a reasonable commercial return on the nominal amount of the capital, and (ii)
any right on repayment of the Senior Secured Notes to an amount which exceeds the nominal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes is reasonably comparable with what is generally repayable (in respect of a similar nominal amount of
capital) under the terms of issue of loan capital listed in the Official List of the London Stock Exchange.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the purchase, ownership
and disposition of the Senior Secured Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential tax effects.
This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), Treasury
regulations issued thereunder (the “Treasury Regulations”), and judicial and administrative interpretations thereof,
each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This
discussion is limited to consequences relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except for the discussion on FATCA
(as defined under “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act”). This discussion does not address the impact of the
U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S. federal
income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws and does not discuss
potentially different consequences applicable to holders of the Existing Senior Secured Notes that are redeemed with
proceeds from this Offering. No rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) have been or are expected
to be sought with respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a
different position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Senior Secured
Notes or that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be relevant to a
holder in light of such holder’s particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules, such as financial
institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities,
U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, tax-exempt organisations, regulated investment
companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or other pass-through entities or arrangements (including foreign

419


-----

branches) or investors in such entities or arrangements, persons liable for any alternative minimum tax, persons
holding the Senior Secured Notes as part of a “straddle,” “hedge,” “conversion transaction” or other integrated
transaction and persons subject to special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to
the Senior Secured Notes being taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is
limited to persons who purchase the Senior Secured Notes for cash at original issuance and at their “issue price” (the
first price at which a substantial amount of the Senior Secured Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond
houses, brokers or similar persons or organisations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or
wholesalers) and who hold the Senior Secured Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a Senior Secured Note that is, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a corporation
or any entity taxable as a corporation created or organised in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof
or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of
its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over the
administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the
trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the Senior
Secured Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the partner
and the activities of the partnership. A holder that is a partnership, and partners in such partnerships, should consult
their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership and disposition of the Senior Secured
Notes.

Prospective purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax
consequences of holding Senior Secured Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the application of
the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of U.S. federal estate and gift
tax laws, the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net investment income, and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.

**_Effect of the IPO Debt Pushdown Provisions_**

In the event that the issuer of the Senior Secured Notes changes as a result of the provisions described under
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown,” such change in the issuer could result in a deemed
exchange of the Senior Secured Notes for “new” notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event,
U.S. Holders generally would recognise any gain on such exchange (although any loss could be disallowed), and the
“new” notes could be treated as issued with original issue discount (“OID”) or a greater amount of OID for U.S. federal
income tax purposes. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential U.S. federal income tax
considerations in such event.

**_Characterisation of the Senior Secured Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see, _e.g., “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional Redemption,”_
“Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes,” and “Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Change of Control”), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may be obligated to redeem the Senior Secured Notes for an_
amount in excess of their adjusted issue price (plus accrued and unpaid interest), or may be obligated to make certain
payments on the Senior Secured Notes in excess of stated principal and interest. Although the issue is not free from
doubt, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause
the Senior Secured Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury
Regulations. Assuming such position is respected, a U.S. holder would be required to include in income the amount
of any such payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with such U.S. holder’s method
of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s position is binding on a
U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If
the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Senior Secured Notes were treated as contingent payment debt
instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on
such Senior Secured Notes, regardless of the holder’s method of accounting, and to treat as ordinary income, rather
than capital gain, any gain recognised on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a
Senior Secured Note. The balance of this discussion assumes that the Senior Secured Notes will not be considered

420


-----

contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential
application to the Senior Secured Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on a Senior Secured Note (including additional amounts paid in respect of
withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income
of a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance with the
U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognise
interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate of exchange on the date
of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. A cash basis
U.S. holder will not realise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest but may recognise
exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who
otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognised with respect to such
interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognise income for each
taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating
such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate of exchange in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with
respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the
U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied
consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which
the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS)
to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day
of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, if that
date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Senior Secured Notes that uses
the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognise foreign currency gain or loss,
on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment,
determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest
income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income
or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.-source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income
or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Senior Secured Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Senior Secured
Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes exceeds their
issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally,
0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date).

In the event of the Senior Secured Notes are issued with OID, U.S. holders of the Senior Secured Notes
generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax
purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, such U.S. holders generally will include any OID in income in
advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

The amount of any OID with respect to a Senior Secured Note includible in income by a U.S. holder is the
sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Senior Secured Note for each day during the taxable year or
portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Senior Secured Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating
to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a
Senior Secured Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Senior Secured Note, provided
that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either
on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the
excess of (i) the product of the Senior Secured Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period
and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly

421


-----

adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The
adjusted issue price of a Senior Secured Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price,
increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Senior Secured Note is the
discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under
the Senior Secured Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note.

OID, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and
then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third
paragraph under “—Payments of Stated Interest.”

A U.S. holder of a Senior Secured Note will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is
paid (including, upon the disposition of such Senior Secured Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts
attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value
of the foreign currency payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received,
and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all
receipts on such Senior Secured Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Senior Secured
Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the
earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will
constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and
generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and
prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Senior Secured
Notes as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Payments of stated interest generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, depending
on the U.S. holder’s circumstances, will generally be considered “passive” category income for purposes of the rules
regarding the foreign tax credit (or at such holder’s election, a deduction in lieu of such credit). If any non-U.S. income
tax were withheld or paid in respect of payments on the Senior Secured Notes at the rate applicable to a U.S. holder,
such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or, at the election of such holder, a deduction in lieu of such credits)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk
requirements). There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits.
Recently issued final U.S. Treasury Regulations have imposed additional requirements that must be met for a foreign
tax to be creditable. However, a recent notice from the IRS indicates that the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the
IRS are considering proposing amendments to such Regulations and allows, subject to certain conditions, taxpayers
to defer the application of many aspects of such Regulations for taxable years beginning on or after December 28,
2021 and ending before the date that a notice or other guidance withdrawing or modifying the temporary relief is
issued (or any later date specified in such notice or other guidance). U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors
regarding the availability of foreign tax credits under their particular circumstances.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or other Taxable Disposition of the Senior Secured Notes_**

A U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Senior Secured Note generally will equal the cost of the Senior Secured
Note to the U.S. holder, increased by any OID previously included in income by such U.S. holder with respect to such
Senior Secured Note. The cost of a Senior Secured Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value
of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the spot rate of exchange in effect on that
date. If the Senior Secured Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects,
an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Senior Secured Note at the spot rate
of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. The conversion of U.S. dollars to a foreign currency and the
immediate use of that currency to purchase a Senior Secured Note generally will not result in taxable gain or loss for
a U.S. holder.

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note, a U.S. holder
generally will recognise gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realised (other than
amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income in
accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above to the extent not previously included
in income by the U.S. holder) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Senior Secured Note. The amount realised

422


-----

on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note for an amount of foreign
currency generally will be the U.S. dollar value of that amount based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of
taxable disposition. If the Senior Secured Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer
(and, if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the settlement
date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be
applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An
accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognise exchange gain or loss to the extent that
there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss
generally will constitute ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognised by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of
a Senior Secured Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and,
with respect to the principal thereof, generally will be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the
U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Senior Secured Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale,
exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the
Senior Secured Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Senior Secured Note.
The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any,
accrued OID (which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue
_Discount,” as applicable) will be recognised only to the extent of the total gain or loss realised by the U.S. holder on_
the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Senior Secured Note, and will be treated as ordinary
income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

Any gain or loss recognised by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognised on the
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note generally will be U.S. source capital
gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Senior Secured Note for more
than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. If any such gain is subject to
foreign income tax, U.S. holders may not be able to credit such tax against their U.S. federal income tax liability,
unless such income tax can be credited (subject to applicable limitations) against U.S. federal income tax due on other
income treated as derived from foreign sources. Alternatively, the U.S. holder may deduct such taxes in computing
taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that the U.S. holder does not elect to claim a foreign
tax credit for any foreign income taxes paid or accrued for the relevant taxable year. In the case of a non-corporate
U.S. holder (including an individual), net long-term capital gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income
tax rates compared to items of ordinary income if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding
periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a foreign
currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured
Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior
Secured Note.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirement_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code intended to require the reporting of certain tax shelter
transactions apply to transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign currency
transactions. Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to the IRS, including, in
certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note or foreign
currency received in respect of a Senior Secured Note (including in respect of stated interest and, if any, OID) to the
extent that any such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition or receipt of foreign currency results in a
tax loss in excess of an applicable threshold amount. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors to determine the
tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the Senior Secured Notes, including any requirement to
file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, payments of interest (including the accrual of OID, if any) and the proceeds from sales or other
dispositions (including retirements or redemptions) of Senior Secured Notes held by a U.S. holder may be required to
be reported to the IRS unless the U.S. holder is an exempt recipient and, when required, demonstrates this fact. In

423


-----

addition, a U.S. holder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to such payments or proceeds unless it
provides a correct taxpayer identification number or certification of exempt status and, in the case of payments of
interest, certifies that such holder is not subject to such withholding, and otherwise complies with applicable
certification requirements. In general, a U.S. holder may comply with this requirement by providing the applicable
withholding agent with a duly completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-9 (or substitute form).

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited
against a U.S. holder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund, _provided that the_
appropriate information is timely furnished to the IRS.

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. holders who are individuals (and certain entities) that hold an interest in “specified foreign
financial assets” (as defined in section 6038D of the Code) are required to report information relating to an interest in
the Senior Secured Notes on an IRS Form 8938, subject to certain exceptions (including an exception for Senior
Secured Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions). If such U.S. holder does not file a required
IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the statute of limitations on the assessment
and collection of all such holder’s U.S. federal income taxes for the related tax year may not close before the date
which is three years after the date on which such report is filed. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated
as an individual for purposes of the foregoing rules. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect,
if any, of this requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Senior Secured Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as “FATCA”) and subject
to the proposed regulations discussed below, a “foreign financial institution” and certain other foreign entities may be
required to withhold U.S. tax on certain “foreign passthru payments” (a term not yet defined) made after December 31,
2018 to the extent such payments are treated as attributable to certain U.S. source payments.

Under proposed Treasury Regulations, withholding on “foreign passthru payments” on Senior Secured Notes
that are not otherwise grandfathered (as described below) would apply to “foreign passthru payments” made on or
after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the U.S. Federal Register of applicable final regulations
defining “foreign passthru payments.” Taxpayers generally may rely on these proposed regulations until final
regulations are issued. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable
final regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are published in the U.S. Federal Register generally would be
“grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is treated
as a foreign financial institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the Senior Secured Notes only if there is a
significant modification of the Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States (and additional
non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement FATCA in a manner that alters the
rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors on how these rules may apply to their investment
in the Senior Secured Notes. In the event any withholding under FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on
the Senior Secured Notes, there will be no additional amounts payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Certain Jersey tax considerations**

The following summary of the anticipated treatment of the Initial Purchasers and holders of Senior Secured
Notes (other than residents of Jersey) is based on Jersey taxation law and practice as they are understood to apply at
the date of this Offering Memorandum and is subject to changes in such taxation law and practice. It does not constitute
legal or tax advice and does not address all aspects of Jersey tax law and practice. Prospective investors in the Senior
Secured Notes should consult their professional advisers on the implications of acquiring, buying, selling or otherwise
disposing of the Senior Secured Notes under the laws of any jurisdiction in which they may be liable to taxation.

If you are in any doubt as to your tax position you should consult your professional tax adviser.

424


-----

**_Taxation of the Initial Purchasers_**

The Initial Purchasers are not regarded as resident for tax purposes in Jersey. Therefore, the Initial Purchasers
will not be liable to Jersey income tax other than on Jersey source income (except where such income is exempted
from income tax pursuant to the Income Tax (Jersey) Law 1961, as amended) and payments in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes may be paid by the Initial Purchasers without withholding or deduction for or on account of Jersey
income tax. The holders of Senior Secured Notes (other than residents of Jersey) will not be subject to any tax in
Jersey in respect of the holding, sale or other disposition of such Senior Secured Notes.

**_Stamp duty_**

In Jersey, no stamp duty is levied on the issue or transfer of the Senior Secured Notes except that stamp duty
is payable on Jersey grants of probate and letters of administration, which will generally be required to transfer the
Senior Secured Notes on the death of a holder of such Senior Secured Notes where such Senior Secured Notes are
situated in Jersey. In the case of a grant of probate or letters of administration, stamp duty is levied according to the
size of the estate (wherever situated in respect of a holder of Senior Secured Notes domiciled in Jersey, or situated in
Jersey in respect of a holder of Senior Secured Notes domiciled outside Jersey) and is payable on a sliding scale at a
rate of up to 0.75% of such estate and such duty is capped at £100,000. Where the Senior Secured Notes are in
registered form and the register is not maintained in Jersey such Senior Secured Notes should not be considered to be
situated in Jersey for these purposes.

Jersey does not otherwise levy taxes upon capital, inheritances, capital gains or gifts nor are there other estate
duties.

in making its investment decision with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. It has had access to such
financial and other information concerning us and the Senior Secured Notes as it has deemed
necessary in connection with its decision to purchase any of the Senior Secured Notes, including an

Memorandum;

(4) It is purchasing the Senior Secured Notes for its own account, or for an account with respect to
which it exercises sole investment discretion and for which it is acting as a fiduciary or agent, in
each case for investment, and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act or any other applicable securities laws, subject
to any requirement of law that the disposition of its property or the property of such investor account
or accounts be at all times within its or their control and subject to its or their ability to resell such
Senior Secured Notes pursuant to Rule 144A, Regulation S or any other exemption from registration

(5) It understands and agrees on its own behalf and on behalf of any investor account for which it is
purchasing Senior Secured Notes resold pursuant to Rule 144A, and each subsequent holder of the
Senior Secured Notes by its acceptance thereof will be deemed to agree, to offer, sell or otherwise
transfer such Senior Secured Notes prior to the date (the “Resale Restriction Termination Date”)

other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the foregoing cases, to require that

and delivered by the transferor to the Transfer Agent or the Registrar (as applicable). The foregoing
restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date;

(6) It understands that each Regulation S Note will bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

-----

(7) It agrees that it will, and each subsequent holder is required to, give to each person to whom it
transfers the Senior Secured Notes notice of any restrictions on the transfer of such Senior Secured
Notes, if then applicable;

(8) It acknowledges that until 40 days after the commencement of the Offering, any offer or sale of the
Senior Secured Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in the
Offering) may violate the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made
otherwise than in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act;

(9) It acknowledges that the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will not be required to accept for
registration or transfer any Senior Secured Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence
satisfactory to us, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have
been complied with;

(10) It acknowledges that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely
upon the truth and accuracy of its acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements
and agrees that if any of the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed
to have been made by its purchase of the Senior Secured Notes are no longer accurate, it shall
promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring any Senior Secured Notes as a fiduciary or
agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole investment discretion with
respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the foregoing
acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements on behalf of each such investor
account;

(11) It understands that no action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction (including the United
States) by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Senior Secured
Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other
offering or publicity material relating to us or the Securities in any country or jurisdiction where
action for such purpose is required. Consequently, any transfer of the Senior Secured Notes will be
subject to the selling restrictions set forth in this Offering Memorandum;

(12) It confirms that it, or the investor account for which it acts, is not a retail investor. For the purposes
of this paragraph, the expression “retail investor” means: (a) in relation to an EEA Member State, a
person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a “retail client” as defined in point (11) of
Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution
Directive where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of
Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II; or (b) in relation to the United Kingdom, a person who is one (or more)
of the following: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No
2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA, or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to
implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;

(13) It understands that: (i) the Senior Secured Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise
made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor
(as defined above) in the EEA or the United Kingdom, and (ii) no key information document
required by the EU PRIIPs Regulation or the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Senior
Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or the United
Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise
making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United Kingdom may be unlawful
under the EU PRIIPs Regulation or the UK PRIIPs Regulation;

(14) It understands that any investment or investment activity to which this Offering Memorandum
relates is available only to (i) qualified investors (as defined in the EU Prospectus Regulation) in
any member state of the EEA; and (ii) qualified investors (as defined in the UK Prospectus
Regulation) in the UK; and

429


-----

(15) It understands that none of the Initial Purchasers, or any person representing any of the foregoing,
have or will circulate in Jersey any offer for subscription, sale or exchange of the Senior Secured
Notes without the consent of the Jersey Financial Services Commission unless a relevant exemption
to such consent applies.

-----

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer intends to offer the Senior Secured Notes through the Initial Purchasers.
Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) dated on or around
the date of the final offering memorandum, by and among, inter alios, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has agreed to sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have
agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the entire principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or refuses to purchase the Senior Secured Notes which
it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the purchase commitments of the other Initial
Purchasers may be increased or that the Purchase Agreement may be terminated.

Senior Secured Notes will initially be offered at the price set forth on the cover page hereof. After the initial
Offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Senior Secured Notes may, from time to time, be varied by
the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to
investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. The Initial Purchasers may participate in the offer or sale of the
Senior Secured Notes through certain of their affiliates or through registered broker dealers. The Initial Purchasers
have not and will not enter into any contractual arrangement with any distributor with respect to the distribution of the
Senior Secured Notes (other than the Agreement Among Initial Purchasers, as defined in the Purchase Agreement,
dated the date of the Purchase Agreement among the several Initial Purchasers), except with their affiliates or with the
prior written consent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept delivery
of the Senior Secured Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.
The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will indemnify the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the Initial
Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

Persons who purchase Senior Secured Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty,
taxes and other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering
price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer has agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers
certain customary fees for their services in connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain
out-of-pocket expenses. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer has also agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial
Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

**Senior Secured Notes Are Not Being Registered under the Securities Act**

Each purchaser of the Senior Secured Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgements, representations
and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors.”

The Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the
Securities Act or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States unless the Senior Secured
Notes are registered under the Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
is available. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Senior Secured Notes for resale in transactions not requiring
registration under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule 144A and in
reliance on Regulation S. Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has agreed that it will not offer or sell the
Senior Secured Notes except to persons it reasonably believes to be “qualified institutional buyers” as defined in and
in reliance on Rule 144A or pursuant to offers and sales to non-US persons outside of the United States in reliance on
Regulation S. For a description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Senior Secured Notes, see
“Notice to Investors.”

**Sales outside of the United States**

In connection with sales outside the United States, each Initial Purchaser has acknowledged and agreed that
it will not offer, sell or deliver the Senior Secured Notes to, or for the account or benefit of, US persons (other than
“distributors” within the meaning of Regulation S) (a) as part of its distribution at any time or (b) otherwise until
40 days after the later of the commencement of the Offering or the date the Senior Secured Notes were originally

431


-----

issued. Each Initial Purchaser will send to each dealer to whom it sells the Senior Secured Notes in reliance on
Regulation S during the 40-day distribution compliance period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the
restrictions on offers and sales of the Senior Secured Notes within the United States or to, or for the account or benefit
of, US persons. In addition, until the expiration of the 40-day distribution compliance period, an offer or sale of the
Senior Secured Notes within the United States by a dealer (whether or not participating in this Offering) may violate
the registration requirements of the Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with
Rule 144A under the Securities Act or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the Securities Act.

Each purchaser of the Senior Secured Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgments, representations,
warranties and agreements as described under “Notice to Investors” in this Offering Memorandum.

**UK PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors**

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has, severally and not jointly, represented and agreed that
it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Senior
Secured Notes to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of this provision:

(i) the expression “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(1) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it
forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(2) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that
customer would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1)
of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA;
and

(ii) the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient
information on the terms of the offer of the Senior Secured Notes to be offered so as to enable an
investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Senior Secured Notes.

Consequently, no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling
the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPS Regulation.

**Other UK regulatory restrictions**

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented, warranted and
agreed that it:

(1) has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning
of section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Senior
Secured Notes in circumstances in which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the
communication; and

(2) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Senior Secured Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United
Kingdom.

432


-----

**EU PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has, severally and not jointly, represented and agreed that
it has not offered, sold or otherwise made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Senior
Secured Notes to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, (1) a “retail investor” means a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II, or (ii) a customer within the
meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II; and (2) the expression “offer” includes the communication in
any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer of the Senior Secured Notes to be
offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Senior Secured Notes. Consequently, no
key information document required by the EU PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Senior Secured Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the
Senior Secured Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under
the EU PRIIPS Regulation.

**Prohibition of Sales in Jersey**

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented, warranted and
agreed that it has not and will not circulate in Jersey any offer for subscription, sale or exchange of the Senior Secured
Notes without the consent of the Jersey Financial Services Commission unless a relevant exemption to such consent
applies.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, the EEA, Canada and the United
Kingdom, by any of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a
public offering of the Senior Secured Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum
or any other material relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors, the Senior Secured Notes or the
Notes Guarantees in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes
may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering
material or advertisements in connection with the Senior Secured Notes may be distributed or published, in or from
any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or
jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in
any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering
Memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering
of the Senior Secured Notes, the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of Senior Secured Notes. See
“Notice to Investors.”

The Initial Purchasers expect to make offers and sales both inside and outside the United States through their
selling agents. Any offers and sales in the United States will be conducted by broker-dealers registered with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC and, therefore, may not make sales
of any Senior Secured Notes in the United States, except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations. To
the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Senior Secured Notes in the United States, they will
do so only through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S. securities
law. If a jurisdiction requires that the Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the Initial Purchasers or any
affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction, the Offering shall be deemed to be
made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in such jurisdiction.

**Settlement**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer expects that delivery of the Senior Secured Notes will be made to investors
on or about     , 2024, which will be the       business day following the date of this Offering Memorandum
(such settlement being referred to as “T+      ”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the “Exchange Act”), trades in the secondary market are required to settle two business days (until the
end of the period of transition to a settlement cycle of T+1 on May 28, 2024), unless the parties to any such trade
expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, the purchasers who wish to trade on the date of this Offering Memorandum
or the next       succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the Senior Secured Notes

433


-----

initially settle in T+    , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement at the time of any such trade to prevent a
failed settlement. Purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes who wish to trade the Senior Secured Notes prior to their
date of delivery hereunder should consult their own advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise
dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or its subsidiaries, and having a tenor of more than one year (other than the Senior Secured Notes
and the Notes Guarantees) during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through and including the date
that is 30 days after the Issue Date, without the prior written consent of the representatives of the several Initial
Purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes under the Purchase Agreement.

**New Issue of Securities**

There is currently no established trading market for the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the Senior Secured
Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under “Notice to Investors.” The Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will apply for the Senior Secured Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the Exchange;
however, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes will be approved for listing
or that such listing will be maintained. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading
markets for, the Senior Secured Notes, nor that you will be able to sell your Senior Secured Notes at a particular time
or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favourable.

The Initial Purchasers may, but are not obligated to, make a market in the Senior Secured Notes as permitted
by applicable law after completion of this Offering. Any market making activity may be discontinued at any time at
the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making activity will be subject
to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
cannot assure you that any market for the Senior Secured Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop
or that you will be able to sell any Senior Secured Notes at a particular time or at a price that will be favourable to
you, if at all. If the Senior Secured Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price,
depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, the operating performance and financial
condition of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries, general economic conditions and other factors.

**Overallotment, Price Stabilisation and Short Positions**

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Senior Secured Notes in the
open market and may, but are under no obligation to, engage in overallotment, stabilising transactions, covering
transactions and penalty bids in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Overallotment involves sales in
excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilising transactions
permit bidders to purchase the underlying Senior Secured Note so long as the stabilising bids do not exceed a specified
maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Senior Secured Notes in the open market after the
distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim
a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Senior Secured Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer
are purchased in a stabilising or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the Offering, Barclays Bank PLC (the “Stabilisation Manager”), or one of its affiliates
or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilise, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the
Senior Secured Notes. Specifically, the Stabilisation Manager, or one of its affiliates or persons acting on its behalf,
may bid for and purchase Senior Secured Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining
the price of the Senior Secured Notes. The Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot
either the Offering (which involves sales in excess of the offering size), creating a short position for the Initial
Purchasers, and may bid for and purchase Senior Secured Notes in the open market to cover such short position. In
addition, the Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Senior Secured Notes
in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. This occurs
when a particular Initial Purchaser repays to the Initial Purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by
it because the Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, have repurchased Senior Secured Notes sold by
or for the account of such Initial Purchaser in stabilising or short covering transactions. These activities may stabilise

434


-----

or maintain the respective market price of the Senior Secured Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail.
The Stabilisation Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.
Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Senior Secured Notes.

These stabilising transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Senior
Secured Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may
begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced,
may be discontinued at any time without notice at the sole discretion of the Stabilisation Manager. If these activities
are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar days after the Issue Date and 60 calendar days
after the date of the allotment of the Senior Secured Notes. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter
market or otherwise. Neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation
or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price
of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in various
activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial advisory, investment
management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and brokerage activities. The Initial
Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed, and may, currently and/or in the future,
perform various financial advisory (including buy-side advisory services to TDR Capital LLP and Mohsin Issa CBE
and Zuber Issa CBE), investment and corporate banking, commercial lending and banking, hedging, consulting and
other commercial services in the ordinary course of business for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, TDR Capital LLP
and Mohsin Issa and Zuber Vali Issa and their respective subsidiaries, affiliates or portfolio companies, as applicable,
and may have from time to time in the past held, and may in the future hold, positions in each of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer’s, TDR’s and Mohsin Issa’s and Zuber Vali Issa’s and their respective subsidiaries’, affiliates’ or
portfolio companies’, as applicable, securities or enter into hedging or general derivative transactions with the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, TDR Capital LLP and Mohsin Issa and Zuber Vali Issa and their respective subsidiaries,
affiliates or portfolio companies, as applicable, in the ordinary course of business, for which they received or will
receive customary fees and commissions and reimbursement of expenses.

In addition, some or all of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are arrangers of and/or lenders
under the Senior Facilities. It is expected that the gross proceeds of the Offering together with the borrowings under
Facility B (EUR) and cash on hand will be used by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to, among other things, prepay
and cancel Facility B, and the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates, as lenders under Facility B, will therefore
each receive a portion of the proceeds of the Offering. Such entities may act as counterparties in the hedging
arrangements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its respective subsidiaries execute in the ordinary course of
business and/or expect to enter into in connection with the Transactions. Barclays Bank PLC acts as facility agent for
the Senior Facilities. Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch acts as security agent for the Existing Senior Secured Notes,
the Existing Senior Notes, the Senior Facilities and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Initial Purchasers or their
respective affiliates will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such capacities.

The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may receive allocations of the Senior Secured Notes. In addition,
the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hold Existing Senior Secured Notes, which are subject to the Richmond
Tender Offer described under “Summary—Richmond Tender Offer.” Therefore, they may (i) tender and receive
consideration for any such Existing Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the
terms of the Richmond Tender Offer, or (ii) otherwise receive payment in connection with the repayment of any
Existing Senior Secured Notes at their stated maturity or First Optional Par Redemption Date, as applicable, in each
case funded with the net proceeds of the New Financing, including the Offering. Barclays Bank PLC is acting as
dealer manager in connection with the Richmond Tender Offer.

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold
a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial
instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments

conditions), which could affect future trading of the Senior Secured Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their
affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its respective affiliates routinely
hedge their credit exposure to them, and the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may in the future otherwise act as
hedge counterparties to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries, in each case consistent with their
customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure
by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short
positions in the securities of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer its subsidiaries, including potentially the Senior Secured
Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Senior Secured
Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

The consolidated financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2023 included in this Offering Memorandum have been audited by KPMG LLP, independent
auditors, as stated in their reports appearing herein. KPMG LLP is a member of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales.

The audit report of KPMG LLP for the years ended December 31, 2023, which is included in this Offering
Memorandum, includes a statement, in accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in
England and Wales, that KPMG LLP does not assume responsibility to anyone (including holders of the Senior
Secured Notes) other than the Group and the Group’s members as a body, for its audit work, audit reports or opinions
it has formed. KPMG LLP has undertaken its audit work, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies
Act 2006, to state to the Group’s members those matters that it is required to state to them in an auditor’s report and
for no other purpose.

The consolidated financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries as of and for the years
ended December 31, 2021 and 2022 included in this Offering Memorandum have been audited by Ernst & Young
LLP, independent auditors, as stated in their reports appearing herein. Ernst & Young LLP is a member of the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

The audit reports of Ernst & Young LLP for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, which are
included in this Offering Memorandum, include a statement, in accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, that Ernst & Young LLP does not assume responsibility to anyone
(including holders of the Senior Secured Notes) other than the Group and the Group’s members as a body, for its audit
work, audit reports or opinions it has formed. Ernst & Young LLP has undertaken its audit work, in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, to state to the Group’s members those matters that it is required to
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.

Investors in the Senior Secured Notes should understand that these statements are intended to disclaim any
liability to parties (such as purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes) other than to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
its subsidiaries with respect to those reports. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a
registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities
Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the
limitation above, the recourse that investors in the Senior Secured Notes may have against the independent auditors
based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to
which auditors have responsibility or liability to third parties is unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including
the United Kingdom, and the legal effect of these statements in the audit reports is untested in the context of an offering
of securities. The inclusion of the language referred to above, however, may limit the ability of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes to bring any action against our auditors for damages arising out of an investment in the Senior Secured
Notes.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors are companies incorporated under the laws of England
and Wales. All the directors and executive officers of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors live outside
the United States. Substantially all of the assets of the directors and executive officers of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and of the Guarantors are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to serve
process on such persons, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Guarantors in the United States or to enforce
judgments obtained in U.S. courts against them based on civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United
States.

**England and Wales and Scotland**

The United Kingdom does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for the reciprocal
recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States. based on civil
liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognised or
enforceable in England and Wales or in Scotland. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales
or Scotland, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales or
Scotland (as applicable). In such an action, the courts of England and Wales or Scotland would not generally
reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it
would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment (or summary decree in Scotland) on such a claim (assuming
that there is no good defence to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the courts of England and Wales or
Scotland can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a
U.S. judgment by a court of England and Wales or Scotland in such an action is conditional upon (among others) the
following:

    - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original
proceedings according to the private international law rules of England and Wales or Scottish rules of
private international law (in other words, it does not matter that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according
to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according to the private international law rules of
England and Wales or Scotland);

    - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and

    - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in
respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that court of England and Wales or Scotland
court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law.

A court of England and Wales or Scotland may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor
satisfies the court that:

    - the U.S. judgment contravenes the public policy of England and Wales or Scotland or the European
Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made
thereunder, to the extent applicable);

    - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as
compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of
Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1
of the Act;

    - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of the principles of natural or substantial
justice of England and Wales or Scotland;

    - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by a court or another court of England
and Wales or Scotland whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales or Scotland or
conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court;

440


-----

    - the enforcement proceedings in England and Wales or Scotland were not commenced within the relevant
limitation period; or

    - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the resolution of disputes under which the
dispute in question was to be resolved otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose
jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit).

Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales or Scotland
that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that
those judgments will be recognised or enforceable in England and Wales or Scotland. In addition, we cannot assure
you whether a court of England and Wales or Scotland would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the
original action was commenced in England and Wales or Scotland, instead of the United States, and predicated solely
upon U.S. federal securities laws. The foregoing assumes that such enforcement action takes place outside of any
bankruptcy or insolvency process: it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or Scotland or
to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings. Finally, note that,
in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any set off or counterclaim that could have been
brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales or Scotland unless the subject of the
counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings. If an English or Scottish court gives judgment for the
sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English or Scottish judgment will be enforceable by any methods generally
available for this purpose. However, the courts of England and Wales and Scotland have discretion to grant a stay/sist
of enforcement if an appeal against the U.S. judgment is pending with a higher court in the United States.

**Northern Ireland**

The United States and the United Kingdom do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (although the United States and the United Kingdom are
both parties to the New York Convention on Arbitral Awards). Any judgment rendered by any federal or state court
in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities law, would
not be directly enforceable in Northern Ireland. In order to enforce such a monetary judgment in Northern Ireland,
under common law rules proceedings must be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a
Northern Irish Court. Summary judgment may be applied for and in this type of action, a Northern Irish court generally
will not (subject to among other things, the matters identified below) reinvestigate the merits of the original matter
decided by a U.S. court if:

    - the relevant U.S. court had territorial, procedural and substantive jurisdiction (under the UK rules of
private international law applicable to Northern Ireland) to give the judgment; and

    - the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum
payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or
otherwise based on a U.S. law that a Northern Irish Court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public
law).

A Northern Irish court may refuse to enforce such a judgment for reasons including if it is established that:

    - the enforcement of such judgment would contravene natural justice, public policy or statute in Northern
Ireland;

    - the enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the amount of
the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as
compensation for the loss or damage sustained);

    - the Northern Irish proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period;

    - before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had been the subject of a
final judgment of a Northern Irish Court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is
enforceable in Northern Ireland;

441


-----

    - the judgment has been obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles of natural justice were
breached;

    - the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which the
dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to whose jurisdiction
the judgment debtor did not submit); or

    - an order has been made and remains effective under section 9 of the UK Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal
Enforcement) Act 1933, applying that section to U.S. courts, including the relevant U.S. court.

If a Northern Irish Court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the Northern Irish
judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. In addition, it may not be possible to
obtain a Northern Irish judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is or becomes subject to any
insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment
creditor. Notwithstanding the above there can be no assurance that any judgment described will be recognised or
enforceable in Northern Ireland. In addition there can be no assurance that a Northern Irish Court will accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Northern Ireland, instead of the United
States, and predicated solely on US federal securities law.

**Jersey**

The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final
judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or
not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognised or enforceable in
Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of
competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an action, a Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the
original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain
summary judgment on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). Recognition and enforcement of a
U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

    - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts of laws
principles;

    - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in
the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money (although there are
circumstances where non-money judgments may also be recognised);

    - the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

    - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in
respect of a penalty or fine;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of
Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the
Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

    - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural justice
or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and

    - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial matters
that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, there can be no assurance that those judgments
will be recognised or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a Jersey court would accept

442


-----

jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Jersey, instead of the United States, and
predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023

**1** **Accounting** **policies**

**General** **information**
The Company is a private company limited by share capital, incorporated and domiciled in England under the
Companies Act 2006 (registration number 12855336).

The address of its registered office is:
ASDA House
Great Wilson Street
Leeds
LS11 5AD
UK

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as
"the Group").

These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board on 2 April 2024.
6

**Statement** **of** **compliance**
The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by directors in accordance with UK-adopted
international accounting standards ("UK-adopted IFRS").

**Summary** **of** **significant** **accounting** **policies** **and** **key** **accounting** **estimates**
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.
Other than the change adopted in the year to the Group's policy in how it applies guidance set out in IAS 36 Impairment (see prior year adjustment narrative below), the accounting policies set out below have been applied
consistently to all periods presented in these group financial statements.

**Basis** **of** **preparation**
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards
("UK-adopted IFRS").

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's
accounting policies.

The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundreds of
thousands of pounds (£0.1m) except where otherwise stated.

As described in the Strategic Report, the main activities of the Group are the retailing of food, food service,
clothing, general merchandise products, fuel and services throughout the United Kingdom and online.

The key risks and opportunities arising from climate change are detailed in the Non-financial and Sustainability
Information Statement in the Strategic Report. These have been informed by the Group’s risk identification
process, as described in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section. The risk assessment indicates that the
potential exposure to climate risks in the near-term is very limited, with lower to moderate potential risks in the
medium term. Management will continue to monitor climate-related risks, and any potential impact on the
financial position of the Group, as they evolve in future periods, through its risk management processes. Further
detail is provided in note 15 of how the expected transition to alternative fuel vehicles is expected to impact on
the Group’s future cashflows, and how this has been taken into account in the impairment tests performed in
relation to the Group’s long-lived assets.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Going concern**
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2023 have been prepared on the going concern basis
as the Directors have determined that the Group has sufficient resources and liquidity facilities to meet its
liabilities as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of approval of the financial statements
(‘the going concern period’).

In assessing the Group’s ability to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have reviewed the Group's
annual corporate planning process which includes profitability, cashflow and liquidity forecasting and have
based their projections for the going concern period on the FY24 plan and extrapolated forecasts for a period
covering 12 months after approval of the financial statements.

The Group’s Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring
forecasts of the Group’s cash flows and maintaining a sufficient level of standby facilities via the Revolving
Credit Facility (RCF). Any capital repayments of long-term financing are forecast in the cash flow model used
in the going concern scenarios. There are no significant maturities of the Group’s long-term financing
arrangements during the going concern period. The Directors continue to assess how to best manage these
medium-term and long term maturities through maintaining adequate standby facilities or refinancing to ensure
the Group maintains a long-term sustainable capital structure.

The Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn at the year end and no utilisation is forecasted in the base case
cash flow model for the going concern period. For more information on liquidity risk and maturity of financial
liabilities see note 21.

In assessing the Group’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have tested the
ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due during the going concern period, in the event of
various cash flow scenarios, including a severe but plausible downside scenario. This scenario applies severe but
plausible economic downsides to our base case forecast, modelling the impact of a sales decline due to a
significant shift in market share, change in consumer preferences, major business disruption or a reputational
incident, alongside the risk of fuel margin decline, inflationary pressures and risk of not achieving forecast
levels of cost transformation activities.

Mitigating actions that are in the control of management have been considered such as reducing non-essential
capital expenditure and discretionary spend. These mitigating actions are not required to be implemented to
ensure sufficient headroom in the severe but plausible downside scenario.

The Directors consider that a scenario with no mitigating actions is not realistic as all modelled mitigating
actions are readily accessible.

The Group is subject to a maintenance covenant whereby the senior secured net leverage ratio cannot exceed
4.90:1. This covenant is required to be tested if, as at the quarter end, drawings on the RCF exceed 40% of the
facility. The Directors have also considered whether the above scenarios trigger the requirement to test the
Group’s financial covenant and have confirmed that there would be no requirement to test financial covenants
under the cashflow scenarios modelled during the going concern period.

The model has been reverse stress tested to determine the level of sales and margin decline that would erode
remaining headroom and lead to the Group breaching the level of available facilities or covenants. The Directors
consider that the likelihood of such a significant deterioration of cash flows or profitability is remote.

On the basis of these assessments, the Directors can conclude it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Prior year adjustment - Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Right of Use Assets**

During the year, the Directors have undertaken a detailed review of the Group’s application of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets in relation to testing for impairment of long-lived assets. In particular, the Directors have
reassessed the application of the IAS 36 with respect to the following stages of the impairment review:

- Identifying CGUs which exhibit impairment triggers;

- Calculating the carrying value of Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”) which are tested for impairment; and,

- Calculating value-in-use (“VIU”) as part of determining the recoverable amount of CGUs

_Identifying Cash Generating Units (CGUs) which exhibit impairment triggers_
In previous years, the Directors applied judgement when assessing which indicators to use in the identification
of CGUs exhibiting impairment triggers. CGUs were considered to exhibit indicators of impairment where their
rolling twelve-month cashflows were negative and where this was the case the Directors would assess the
recoverable amount of the CGU. Following the review undertaken during the year, the Directors have adopted
additional indicators, both qualitative and quantitative, to broaden the assessment of impairment triggers. These
indicators now include the following:

a) Negative cashflows generated by CGUs in the preceding twelve months
b) Adverse cashflow performance against budget and year-on-year cashflow deterioration
c) Specific CGU qualitative factors such as environmental damage and store closure

In relation to a), the Directors have updated the method of allocating central costs when determining the net
cashflows generated by a CGU. In previous years, cashflows generated by CGUs were calculated by allocating
only those central costs which were deemed to be variable and incrementally generated by those CGUs - notably
variable distribution costs incurred in delivering goods to stores. Following the review undertaken during the
year, all relevant central costs incurred by the Group have been allocated to CGUs as part of the calculation of
the cashflows generated by CGUs in the preceding twelve months. This has significantly increased the number
of CGUs exhibiting quantitative impairment triggers compared to previous years.

_Calculating the carrying value of CGUs which are tested for impairment_
As detailed in the significant judgements and estimates section of note 1 to the accounts, the Directors consider
that each store site constitutes a CGU for the purposes of impairment testing as each store site generates
cashflows independently from other store sites. During the year, the Directors have reconsidered how the
carrying value of central assets (for example, the carrying value of long-lived assets relating to the Group’s
distribution centres and home offices) is allocated to CGUs. In previous years, the carrying value of central
assets was not allocated to CGUs but was tested for impairment by estimating the recoverable amount of the
Group’s long-lived asset base as a whole by reference to the aggregate cashflows and fair value of the business
as a whole.

As part of the review undertaken during the year, the Directors have determined that central assets can be
allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis prior to testing those CGUs for impairment by reference
to revenue by CGU.

_Calculating value-in-use (“VIU”) as part of determining the recoverable amount of CGUs_
In addition, in tandem with the review of the allocation of central assets to CGUs, the Directors have also
determined that central costs can also be allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis when
determining the cashflows which are generated by CGUs by reference to revenue by CGU.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Previously, the forecast cashflows prepared by the Directors to calculate the VIU of CGUs which are tested for
impairment included only those central costs which were by the Directors’ judgement deemed variable and
incrementally generated by those CGUs.

In addition, the Directors now also allocate working capital movements in determining the forecast cashflows
used in VIU calculations.

_Impact on Financial Statements of the change in how the Group applies the requirements of IAS 36_
Given that the changes adopted during the year by the Group in relation to how IAS 36 is applied has increased
the number of CGUs to be tested; reducing the cashflows generated by CGUs in the preceding twelve months;
and of reducing the VIU of those CGUs for which impairment testing is performed, and after considering the
fair value of each CGU, these changes have resulted in a material increase in the pre-tax cumulative impairment
charge recorded by the Group at 31 December 2023 compared to the cumulative impairment charge that would
have been recorded under the previous application of the accounting standard. As set out in note 5, the
cumulative net impairment charge for the years ended 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2023 is £151.7m
(post-tax £128.8m).

The Directors have considered the guidance set out in IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting
Estimates and Errors and have also taken account of the stated objective of financial statements as set out in IAS
1 - Presentation of Financial Statements to provide information about the financial position and financial
performance of an entity which is useful to a wide range of users. As the reassessment of the Group’s
application of IAS 36 has been applied in order to provide readers with more reliable information about the
carrying value of the Group’s long-lived assets at the balance sheet date, the Directors have applied judgement
to conclude that the effect of the revised allocation of central costs to both the assessment of impairment triggers
and the forecast cashflows used in the VIU calculations and the allocation of central assets to CGUs should be
applied to the impairment review conducted at 31 December 2022.

The Directors have also carried out the same impairment review at 31 December 2021 and concluded that no
changes in presentation are required as there were no significant changes in the property values in the period
since the acquisition of the Asda in February 2021 to the year end.

This results in a pre-tax impairment charge for the year ended 31 December 2022 of £377.4m (post-tax
£312.2m) of which £357.5m (pre-tax) was not previously recorded in the 2022 financial statements. As this
amount results from a change in application of the requirements of IAS 36, the Directors have recorded a prior
year adjustment as per the requirements of IAS 8.

Further detail regarding Group accounting policies in relation to impairment are provided in note 1 and further
detail relating to impairment charges recorded during the current and prior year is provided in notes 12 and 13.

A summary of how the above prior year restatements have impacted the Consolidated Income Statement and
Consolidated Balance Sheet for the year ended 31 December 2022 is set out below.

As the total restated impairment charge for 2022 of £377.4m (see note 5) is material and outside the normal
course of business, the full 2022 impairment charge has been classified as non-underlying in line with the
Group's policy on non-underlying items (see note 1 for further detail). Impairment charges included in the 2022
financial statements of £19.9m were not previously reported as non-underlying costs as they were not material.
As a result, operating profit pre non-underlying items for the year ended 31 December 2022 has increased by
£19.9m from a previously reported figure of £405.5m to £425.4m. Similarly, profit before tax pre
non-underlying items has increased from £74.4m to £94.3m and profit for the year pre non-underlying items has
increased from £91.2m to £111.1m.

**New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective**
There are no issued but not yet effective standards, interpretations and amendments, which have not been
applied in these financial statements, that will or may have a material impact on the Group financial statements
in future.

**Judgements, estimates and assumptions**
Management are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies
and reported assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually
evaluated and are based on historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The key judgements, estimates and assumptions impacting the carrying value of assets and liabilities are
discussed further below.

_Judgements_

_Business combinations - acquisition date relating to the Group's purchase of the share capital of Arthur_
_Foodstores Limited_

On 30 October 2022, ASDA Stores Limited ("ASDA Stores") agreed to purchase 100% of the entire issued
share capital of Arthur Foodstores Limited (‘Arthur Foodstores’). The acquisition will support and accelerate
ASDA’s existing strategy to expand in the convenience market.

On 26 October 2022 the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order
(“IEO”) under section 72 (2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Asda Stores Limited; Asda Group Limited; Mr
Mohsin Issa; Mr Zuber Issa; TDR Capital LLP; TDR Capital III Portfolio No. 2 L.P.; TDR Capital III
Investments (2019) L.P.; Co-operative Group Limited and Arthur Foodstores Limited. The IEO commenced on
30 October 2022.

The Directors have considered the criteria set out in IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ required to
establish control over a subsidiary which are as follows and all of which need to be met to consolidate an
investee as a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements:
(a) power over the investee, for example through voting or other rights;
(b) exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the Group's returns.

The IEO placed restrictions on the Group which included to hold separate the Arthur business. This restricted
the Group’s ability to direct relevant activities including, for example, preventing the Group from managing
employees of Arthur, setting retail prices for the grocery and fuel business, and placing other restrictions such as
performing any integration activities, or exchanging of commercially sensitive information. To comply with the
IEO restrictions, an independent management team was appointed to run the Arthur business and an
Outsourcing and Interim Franchising Agreement (“OIFA”) with the previous owner was executed. Further, the
Group sought certain derogations during the period to ensure that the Arthur business runs on a going concern
basis as per the IEO.

The Group held 100% of share capital and was exposed to the variable returns during the IEO period, however,
did not have power over Arthur Foodstores whilst the IEO remained in place.

As at 31 December 2022, as a result of restrictions as explained above, the Group concluded that it did not have
control of Arthur Foodstores Limited at that date (from October 30 to December 31, 2022) and therefore the
results of the business were not consolidated in the prior year consolidated financial statements.

On 30 May 2023, when the CMA accepted the Group’s undertaking which involved divesting of 13 petrol
filling stations, restrictions imposed under the IEO were lifted by the CMA. Upon lifting of the IEO, the Group
was able to direct relevant activities to affect the returns to be generated from Arthur Foodstores. From that date,
the Directors have concluded that the Group has met the conditions set out in IFRS 10 to establish control over
Arthur Foodstores and as such, the results of the Arthur business are consolidated within the Group financial
statements in the current year from that date.

_Business combinations - acquisition date relating to the Group's purchase of the share capital of Euro Garages_
_(Jersey) Limited_

On 31 October 2023 Project America Bidco Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco PLC,
completed its acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Ltd (“EGJL”), comprising the majority of EG Group’s UK
business. The business is a fuel, grocery and foodservice retailer operating throughout the United Kingdom.

The business was acquired for consideration of £2.025bn on a debt-free basis, without any restrictions placed on
the group by the CMA.

The Directors considered the criteria set out in IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ required to
establish control over a subsidiary which are as follows and all need to be met to consolidate an investee as a
subsidiary for in the consolidated financial statements:
(a) Power over the investee, for example through voting or other rights;
(b) Exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement in the investee; and
(c) The ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the Group’s returns.

There were no restrictions on the Group’s ability to direct the relevant activities of the EGJL business as at and
subsequent to the 31 October 2023. Therefore, the results of EGJL have been consolidated since 31 October
2023 as this was the date that the Group gained control of the business.

IFRS 3R ‘Business Combinations’ requires the acquiror to determine whether there are any pre-existing
arrangements between the acquiror and acquiree which were entered into before negotiations for the business
combination began, or whether there are arrangements entered into during the negotiations for acquisition which
do not form part of the business combination for the purposes of acquisition accounting. EGJL was a related
party of the Group prior to entering into the negotiations for the business combination and there were already
pre-existing trading relationships and real estate leases in place between the Group and the acquiree before
negotiations for the business combination began. None of these arrangements included any settlement
provisions. These arrangements are detailed in Note 30. The Directors have assessed the terms of these
arrangements at the acquisition date and concluded that they were on current market terms. As such, the
consideration and total identifiable net assets acquired have not been adjusted to reflect these pre-existing
relationships.

At completion, the Group entered into a number of arrangements with EG Finco Limited, including a
Transitional Services Agreement (TSA) and an integration support arrangement. These arrangements were all
negotiated concurrently with the acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited. Directors have concluded that
these arrangements are not part of the business combination and therefore, have been accounted for separately
from the business combination.

The Directors are required to identify the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the business
combination and perform fair value assessments of these assets and liabilities. Fair value measurements are
estimates of the amounts for which assets or liabilities could be transferred at the acquisition date, based on the
assumption that such transfers take place between participants in principal markets and, where applicable, taking
highest and best use into account. These valuations therefore require the Directors to make estimates of the fair
value of these assets and liabilities using appropriate valuation techniques, including acquired property, related
tangible assets and identified intangible assets. The valuation methodologies adopted for the valuation of
property, related tangible assets, intangible assets and short term leases are outlined below:


-----

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_Freehold and long-leasehold property and leasehold improvements_
Freehold and long-leasehold properties have been valued using an income capitalisation approach to value the
assets. These are trading properties and as such the assets have been valued as fully equipped operational
entities. The rental values and property yields for the units vary according to the location and trading potential of
the properties. The values have been arrived at by analysing historic trading data and considering comparable
transactional evidence. In assessing the rental value of the properties, the Directors have had regard to the
trading history of the properties, economic market conditions and arrived at a considered opinion of fair and
maintainable trading performance. The fair values for the long leasehold properties exclude the lease liability
but do reflect the unexpired lease term.

Leasehold improvements have been valued based on depreciated replacement cost.

_Investment properties_
Investment properties have been valued using an income capitalisation approach which reflects the unexpired
lease term followed by a reversion with no contracted income at the valuation date. The reversionary value
reflects the estimated rental values for the individual units as opposed contractual rent under the leases. The
rental values and property yields for the units vary according to the location and trading potential of the
properties. The properties have been valued individually rather than as a portfolio.

Investment properties assumed as part of the acquisition are freehold properties where the group has entered into
lease arrangements with subsidiaries of EG Finco Limited. These lease arrangements are underwritten by a
guarantee from EG Finco Limited.

_Short term leases_
Short term leases have been valued based on an income approach, whereby the differential between contractual
rent and market rent is calculated up to the concluded lease expiry date and discounted back to calculate net
present value lease favourability or unfavourability.

_Intangible assets_
The intangible asset relating to the LEON brand has been valued using the relief from royalty approach. The
brand intangible has been assumed to have useful life of 20 years.

_Accounting for leases as a lessor_
The Group has entered into a number of lease arrangements with subsidiaries of EG Finco Limited at
completion relating to properties owned or leased by the Group, including freehold properties which have been
valued as investment properties.

The classification of these lease arrangements as either operating or finance leases has been assessed in
accordance with IFRS 16. For the freehold properties which are investment properties, the value of the
properties and minimum lease payments have been bifurcated between the land and buildings and assessed
separately. The lease of the land has been classified as operating leases and the fair value of the land recognised
as investment properties on acquisition. The lease of the buildings has been classified as finance leases and a
finance lease receivable equivalent to the net investment in the lease has been recognised on acquisition.

Where the properties are leased by the group, the sub-lease has been assessed as to whether it should be
classified as a finance lease or operating lease at acquisition by reference to the related right of use asset. Where
the arrangements provide for the sub-lease to be back-to-back with the headlease such that the payments under
the headlease are passed through to the lessee and the sub-lease is for the remaining term of the headlease, the
leases have been classified as finance leases. Consequently, at acquisition, the right of use asset has been
derecognised and a finance lease receivable recognised based on the net investment in the lease at acquisition.

_IFRS 16 lease term_
IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the period covered by
options to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option, and the period covered by an
option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise the option. The Group applies
judgement to whether an extension should be added to the non-cancellable lease term with reference to the
following:

- Extension options in the contract. Consideration as to whether any option is reasonably certain to be
exercised is based on whether an economic incentive exists to do so. This incentive is assessed by reference
to multiple factors including but not limited to current operational performance of the site and future
performance projections, length of time to the option exercise date and future capital requirements. The
majority of the Group's leases do not have extension options in the contract but, where they do, most lease
terms include the extension period.

- Geographical factors. A term extension on any lease for sites in England and Wales may be judged
reasonably certain on the basis of security of tenure if an economic incentive to remain in the lease beyond
the contractual term is deemed to exist. This incentive is assessed by reference to the same factors listed
above. If an extension is judged reasonably certain, the typical additional term applied is 10 years.
Geographical factors are not considered for sites outside England and Wales.

In the event of changing circumstances or new information that may impact judgements taken, lease terms will
be re-assessed on a lease by lease basis. Term reassessments are identified on an ad-hoc basis in light of new or
updated information which would impact the assumptions originally recognised. Any change in lease term could
result in a recalculation of the lease liability and a material adjustment to the associated right-of-use asset. There
were two examples of term reassessment in 2023 which led to a £9.7m reduction in the right-of-use asset and
£10.1m reduction in the lease liability (2022: nil).

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_IFRS 16 discount rate_

IFRS 16 requires that lease liabilities are discounted at the interest rate implicit in a lease, or where this isn’t
available, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The majority of the Group’s leases do not include an interest
rate implicit in the lease, and therefore the incremental borrowing rate is utilised to calculate these lease
liabilities.

The incremental borrowing rate is considered a key judgement and under IFRS 16 reflects the rate of interest a
lessee would incur to borrow over a similar term, with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of
a similar value in a similar economic environment.

We consider the following factors in determining the incremental borrowing rate:

- The risk free rate of return in the UK market; and,

- The credit risk spread which reflects the additional risks associated with lending specifically to the Group,
taking account of factors such as our credit rating, the term of the lease, and the geographic location.

The risk free rate is observable in the market and is the base of our calculation, however there is significant
judgement in determining the additional credit risk spread specific to the Group on the basis that there is limited
market observable data on which to make this judgement, particularly for lease terms in excess of 10 years. As a
result we utilise rates from other geographical regions (e.g. US) for companies with a similar credit rating where
there is more market observable data on which to base our judgement. The geographical locations utilised,
alongside the specific data selected for inclusion are considered a key judgement.

Due to the extent of the Group’s lease portfolio, small changes in discount rate can significantly impact the
accounting recognition and could result in a material difference to the right-of-use asset, lease liability, and
associated depreciation and interest charge recognised in the Income Statement.

Further, the Group has leases for a wide range of different terms, from 1 year to in excess of 100 years.
Judgement is used by the Group to apply a cap of 30 years to the discount rate on the basis that data relating to
loans for terms in excess of 30 years is rare and as such, no more reliable rate than a 30 year rate can be
determined.

The Group also applies judgement in determining the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis.
Management have asserted that by updating the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis, we ensure that
the discount rate used remains relevant, current and materially correct. Should events and conditions change in
the interim period we would consider whether the discount rate should be updated on a more frequent basis.

_Supply Chain Finance_

Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be
classified as trade payables or as another line item on the Balance Sheet. In determining the classification, the
Group reviews each arrangement against a number of characteristics to assess whether the substance of
liabilities owed by the Group to the participating banks under the contractual terms of the arrangements is
consistent with other trade payables. These include:

- Whether participation in the schemes is voluntary for suppliers;

- Whether the Group is involved in the negotiations and agreements between the banks and suppliers or
tri-partite agreements exist;

- Whether payment terms have been extended outside industry norms for trade payables;

- Whether interest is accrued on outstanding balances or fees are receivable by the Group;

- Whether the banks require parent guarantees in respect of the Group’s obligations;

- Whether the Group retains its rights to offset credits or withhold payment.

The nature of the Group’s liabilities under supply chain financing arrangements when considering these
characteristics supports classification of amounts owed by the Group under its supply chain financing
arrangements as trade payables. Accordingly, purchases of goods under supply chain financing arrangements are
recognised within operating costs and settlement of liabilities under supply chain financing arrangements are
classified as operating cashflows (see note 21 for amounts utilised under supply chain finance agreements).

_Litigation_

Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance
with IAS 37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters
are made in relation to contingent liabilities (see note 29).

_Estimates_
_Estimates in the business combination_
Forecasts of future performance of the acquired business are utilised in the calculation of the fair value of assets
acquired. The group uses third party valuation specialists to calculate the fair value of intangibles and property,
plant and equipment who use these forecasts as an input into the valuations.

For leasehold properties the fair value of right-of-use assets is determined using market rentals, determined with
the support of property surveyors, these market rentals are discounted based on an IFRS 16 discount rate as that
date of acquisition. As noted in the ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’ section above, there is inherent judgement included
in the determination of the appropriate discount rate.

_Impairment of non-financial assets_
The Group tests intangibles (including goodwill) and other non-current assets for impairment as discussed in
notes 12, 13 and 15. Forecast cashflows are used in the impairment models and estimates of long term growth
rates are identified to extrapolate cashflows past the 3 year planning horizon.

_Estimation of store inventory losses_
Adjustments to store inventory are recorded based on the results of physical inventory counts, which are
performed throughout the year by an independent third party. Store inventory losses arising between the dates of
physical counts and the balance sheet date are estimated and provided for as a percentage of sales arising
between physical inventory counts. The provision is recorded on store-by-store basis and takes into account
several factors - most notably the most recent physical inventory count result of the store analysed by trading
department, and wider trends in store inventory loss experienced by the Group.

During the year, taking into account recent experience of trends in inventory loss observed by the Group and the
wider retail industry, the Directors have updated the estimation basis for store inventory loss provisions at the
Balance Sheet date from a three count average to being based on the most recent physical count. The provision
for store inventory loss at 31 December 2023 is £140.2m (2022: £95.9m).

As a result of updating the estimation basis for store inventory loss as described above, the Group has
recognised a charge to operating costs of £33.8m during the year. This is included in cost of goods sold in the
table disclosed in note 5.

At 31 December 2023, an increase in the inventory loss provision amounting to 0.01% of sales since the most
recent physical count of each store would increase the provision for inventory loss at 31 December 2023 by
£1.0m.

_Deferred gains and losses relating to sale-and-leaseback transaction_
The Group estimates the gain or loss on sale to be recognised in the Income Statement based on the amount of
the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The remaining gain or loss is deferred as a
reduction or increase to the right-of-use asset relating to the leaseback. This estimate requires determining the
fair value of the properties transferred and calculating the lease liability of the leaseback. As noted in the ‘IFRS
16 discount rate’ section above, there is inherent judgement included in the determination of the appropriate
discount rate. The fair value of properties transferred is determined using third party valuation specialists. Please
see further detail on financial amounts in note 10.

**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Bellis Finco PLC and all its
subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which Bellis Finco PLC has control. The Group has control over
another entity when the Group has all of the following:
(a) power over the investee, for example through voting or other rights;
(b) exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the Group's returns.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement from
the date that control is established or up to the date at which control is lost, as appropriate. Where necessary,
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with
those used by the Group.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its
subsidiaries, which are related parties, are eliminated in full.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Business combinations and goodwill**
Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition
date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of
non-controlling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets
is determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in
operating costs. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for
appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the
consideration transferred and any amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the fair value of
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the
contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities
representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably.

If the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and any amount recognised for
the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the
difference represents a gain on bargain purchase (negative goodwill) and is recognised in the Consolidated
Income Statement as other income.

The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured at acquisition date fair
value in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ with the exception of income taxes, employee
benefits, reimbursement assets, reacquired rights, share-based payments and assets held-for-sale.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to
each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of
whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit, or group of units, to
which goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored
for internal management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the
goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when
determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured
based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

**Foreign currency**
The presentational currency of the Group is Sterling. The primary functional currency of the parent and
subsidiary companies is also Sterling.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement,
except when hedge accounting is applied and differences are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rate reflecting the cost of settling any liabilities incurred in purchasing them, taking into account gains
and losses on foreign currency forward contracts where relevant.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the spot rate ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate
approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.

Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive
income. They are released into the Consolidated Income Statement upon disposal.

**Non-underlying items presented in the consolidated Income Statement**
In order to provide stakeholders with additional insight into the year on year performance of the Group, and to
align presentation more closely with how financial performance is monitored internally by the Executive
Committee and the Board of Directors, items in the consolidated Income Statement are shown on a basis which
excludes the impact of non-underlying items alongside the reported IFRS numbers.

Determining which items are to be presented as non-underlying items requires judgement and is based on an
assessment of the size and nature of Income Statement amounts. This includes identifying material amounts
which do not arise in the normal course of business, or are non-recurring, and are individually significant
enough to impact a reader's assessment of the Group's financial performance.

Profit excluding non-underlying items is not an IFRS measure and as such is not directly comparable to other
companies.

Further detail of amounts classified as non-underlying items in the current and prior year is provided in note 5.

**Intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired are carried initially at cost. Following initial recognition, the historic cost model is
applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Software costs**
Intangible assets include software costs. Software costs capitalised consist of both costs from third parties and
costs of internal resources involved in development activities. When considering whether software costs can be
capitalised, the Directors perform an assessment of whether the Group controls the underlying asset. Factors
considered when assessing whether the Group controls an asset include where and how the software is hosted
and the ability the Group has to make changes to the software.

Costs are only capitalised once a project is in the development stage and approval for the project as a whole to
be completed has been obtained. Costs incurred in the research stage are expensed as incurred. Integration costs
between different software are capitalised where it can be demonstrated that these are separate intangible assets
and control is evident.

In relation to Software as a Service (“SAAS”) contracts, where it cannot be demonstrated that the Group
controls the underlying assets' development, costs incurred are immediately recognised as an expense in the
Consolidated Income Statement other than software licence fees which are included in prepaid expenses and
amortised over the period of the respective licence. The factors noted above in relation to how the software is
hosted and whether the Group has the ability to make or direct changes directly to the underlying software as
part of the SAAS contract are considered as part of this assessment.

Where implementation costs are incurred as part of a SAAS contract, these implementation costs are separately
considered to identify whether they represent an intangible asset in their own right as detailed above. If the
Directors conclude that implementation costs do not meet the recognition criteria of a separate intangible asset,
an assessment is then made as to whether the costs represent configuration of the software product or
customisation. If configuration, these costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred,
whereas if customisation the Directors will assess whether these should be recognised over the term of the
SAAS contract if they are not distinct from the underlying software product itself. Purchases of hardware are
capitalised as Property, Plant and Equipment.

Costs associated with interim software solutions which do not meet the Group’s policy of a 3 year minimum
useful economic life are expensed as incurred.

**Brand licences**
Brand licences are capitalised when acquired as part of a business combination if they are separable or arise
from contractual or other legal rights. A brand licence is initially measured at fair value using an appropriate
valuation methodology (e.g. relief-from-royalty approach). Brand licences are not amortised where they have an
indefinite useful life. Costs in relation to internally generated brands are not capitalised.

**Customer relationships**
Customer relationships are capitalised when acquired as part of a business combination if they are separable or
arise from contractual or other legal rights. A customer relationship is initially measured at fair value using an
appropriate valuation methodology (e.g. multi-period excess earnings method). Customer relationships are
amortised over their useful economic life of 10 years.


-----

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Amortisation**
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their
expected useful lives, with charges included in operating costs, as follows:

Software and development costs 4 years
Customer contractual relationships 10 years

The purchased goodwill of the Group and brand licence intangibles are regarded as having an indefinite useful
economic life and in accordance with IAS 38, are not amortised but are subject to annual tests for impairment.

**Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Items of property, plant and equipment under construction are valued at cost and not depreciated. Depreciation
is charged from the date that the assets are available for use.

All property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment at least annually in accordance with IAS 36
‘Impairment of Assets’.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the
asset is included in the Income Statement.

**Depreciation**
Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as
follows:

Freehold properties 3 - 50 years
Leasehold improvements Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term
Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings Shorter of 3 - 50 years or the lease term

**Investment properties**
Property held to earn rental income is classified as investment property and is measured initially at cost,
including transaction costs. Following initial recognition, investment properties are carried at cost less any
accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.

There is no depreciation on freehold land. Investment property under construction is held at cost until such time
as the property is available for use. Properties held under lease are not treated as investment property with the
exception of leasehold improvements relating to the leased properties.

Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property
is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gains or
losses on the retirement or disposal of investment properties are recognised in the Income Statement in the
period of de-recognition. Transfers are made to or from investment property only when there is a change in use.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Impairment of non-financial assets**
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine
whether there is any indication of impairment. Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent
from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which the
asset belongs. If any such indication exists, the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount is estimated. Indefinite
lived intangibles (such as Goodwill) are tested annually for impairment regardless of whether any indicators for
impairment exist.

An asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in
use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be
impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time-value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses on continuing operations are
recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the
impaired asset.

The Group considers each store as a separate CGU. A CGU may include a combination of grocery store, PFS
and/or Foodservice outlet. The carrying value of each CGU includes property, plant and equipment, lease
right-of-use-assets, allocation of central assets and allocation of working capital. Central assets including
distribution warehouses and head office assets are allocated to CGUs using sales as the benchmark to estimate
level of use of these assets.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated first to reduce the carrying
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and second, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in
the unit on a pro-rata basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that
are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Assets held for sale**
The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that
it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn.

Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one
year from the date of the classification.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for
sale. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

**Provisions**
A provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as
a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect is material,
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time-value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Leases**

**_The Group as a lessee_**

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. The Group recognises a
right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the
lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). For these leases,
the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from
the leased assets are consumed.

_Lease liability_

The lease liability is initially measured at the value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement
date, discounted to present value.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

- Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

- Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

- The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and,

- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to
terminate the lease.

Lease liabilities are presented as separate current and non-current amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liability (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease
payments made.

The Group re-measures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use
asset) whenever:

- The lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in
the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is re-measured by
discounting the revised lease payments using the current discount rate;

- The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using an unchanged discount rate; or,

- A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case
the lease liability is re-measured based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised
lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.

_Discount rate_

When discounting payments to present value, the Group uses the interest rate implicit in the lease if this rate can
be readily determined. For a small volume of high value leases, the rate implicit in the lease can be calculated
and has therefore been used.

Otherwise, for the majority of leases the rate used is based on an estimated incremental borrowing rate. Further
detail on the calculation of the incremental borrowing rate is detailed in the ‘Key judgements’ section of this
note under the heading ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_Right-of-use Assets_

Right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made
at or before the commencement day (including lease buy out payments made to previous tenants) less any lease
incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term. If the lease includes an option to transfer ownership of
the underlying asset, or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase
option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. Depreciation is
charged from the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified
impairment loss as described in the ‘Impairment of non-financial assets' policy above.

_Non-lease components and variable rent expense_

As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for
any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has taken this election with
the exception of IT and printer leases where other charges included in the contract (maintenance and
replenishment) are accounted for separately within related cost lines.

The primary non-lease components recognised within lease payments are property costs (service charges and
insurances) paid to landlords and included within the terms of lease contracts. These costs are included within
the lease payments at commencement date if fixed, or within variable rent expense as incurred if not. The
majority of these payments are variable and therefore not included in the lease liability.

As a lessee, the Group does not have any rent payment terms linked to sales or other variable metrics.

**_The Group as a lessor_**

The Group has entered into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to certain owned and leased property.
Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating leases. Whenever the terms of the
lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a
finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Rental income from operating leases, including
the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the head lease and sub-lease are accounted for as two separate
contracts and assessment of classification is made with reference to the right-of-use asset resulting from the
head lease rather than the underlying asset. Where the sub-lease is classified as a finance lease, the lease
right-of-use asset is derecognised and replaced by a finance lease receivable, reflecting the discounted future
value of minimum rentals due.

Third party lessees are subject to credit checks prior to entering into a lease contract with the Group and may be
required to provide a guarantor depending on the outcome of these checks. Additionally, some leases contain
clauses enabling upwards revision of the rental charge according to prevailing market condition at points within
the lease contracts.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Financial instruments**
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.

_Financial assets and liabilities_
The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities in the following categories: non-interest-bearing financial
assets, interest bearing receivables, derivatives designated as hedging instruments, cash and cash equivalents,
non-interest-bearing financial liabilities and interest-bearing borrowings. The Group's accounting policies
relating to lease liabilities are described above.

Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.

All financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. The Group assesses financial assets for
impairment using the expected credit losses model and recognises impairment losses as required.

_Non-interest-bearing financial assets and interest-bearing receivables_
These categories include trade and other receivables and intercompany receivables which are held with the sole
objective of collecting contractual cash flows and are therefore carried at amortised cost. They are included in
current assets except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.

_Derivatives designated as hedging instruments_
Derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign
currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations.

Derivatives are stated at their fair value. The fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts is their market
value at the Balance Sheet date. Market values are calculated using mathematical models and are based on the
duration of derivative together with quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
market volatility at the Balance Sheet date.

The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is measured using a swap valuation model, this model
incorporates various observable market inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange
spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the respective
currencies and interest rate curves.

The fair value of interest rate swaps is measured using a swap valuation model, this model incorporates various
observable market inputs including the credit quality of counterparties and interest rate curves.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship
is formally designated and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will
be measured throughout its duration.

All of the Group’s hedges are considered to be cash flow hedges, hedging exposure to variability in cash flows
that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable
forecast transaction. The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk in
forecast transactions and firm commitments (refer to note 21 for further details). In addition, the Group uses
cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk, floating interest rate risk
relating to its foreign currency borrowings and interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to floating interest rate risk
relating to a proportion of the Apollo facility, which is a variable rate sterling term loan.

For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in
other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
For hedges of foreign currency purchases the gain or loss is recognised within cost of inventories. For
cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps, the gain or loss is recognised in finance costs or
finance income. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Consolidated Income
Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.

If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated Income Statement. If the hedging instrument expires
or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked,
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the
forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement.

_Non-interest-bearing financial liabilities_
The Group’s non-interest-bearing financial liabilities include trade and other payables and intercompany
payables, which are recognised at amortised cost.

_Interest-bearing borrowings_
The Group’s interest-bearing borrowings include intercompany borrowings and external borrowings and are
recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or losses arising on repurchase, settlement or
cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income or finance costs. Borrowings are
classified as current liabilities except for those with contractual maturities greater than 12 months after the
Balance Sheet date.

_Offsetting of financial instruments_
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet only when there is a
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

_Fair values_
Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent
arm’s length transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same,
discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Inventories**
Inventories comprise goods for resale and goods not for resale and are stated at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price (excluding VAT) less all costs which
would need to be incurred to facilitate sale.

_Goods for resale_
Warehouse inventories are valued at weighted average cost. Inventories at retail outlets are valued using the
Retail Inventory Method to estimate average cost. Expenditure incurred in acquiring the goods and bringing
them to their existing location and condition (including applicable supplier income, import duties and freight
costs as appropriate) are included in inventories.

Adjustments relating to inventory gains and losses in stores are recorded based on the results of physical
inventory counts, which are performed throughout the year by an independent third party. Store inventory losses
arising between the dates of physical counts and the balance sheet date are estimated and provided for based on
recent count results.

Adjustments to the carrying value of inventory are recorded when the net realisable value of inventory is
estimated to be lower than cost - for example, where items are slow moving or obsolete.

_Goods not for resale_
Goods not for resale primarily comprise fuel for own use and are valued at cost on a first in, first out basis.

**Taxation**
The tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement,
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised as other comprehensive income, in which case the tax is
also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.

Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes except:

- the initial recognition of goodwill or of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit
other than in a business combination;

- in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences
will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and,

- deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the asset can be utilised.

The amount of deferred tax provided is measured on an undiscounted basis based on the expected manner of
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the Balance Sheet date.

In line with the requirements of IAS 12 - Income Taxes, provisions are recognised for uncertain tax positions
where a risk of an additional tax liability is identified and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle
that tax. This will be measured based on management’s expectation of the outcome of decisions by the relevant
tax authority, assessed on a case-by-case basis using in-house tax experts, professional firms and previous
experience.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Trade and other receivables**
Trade and other receivables are stated at their original invoiced value (discounted if material) as reduced by
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are
assessed as uncollectible. Trade receivables are presented net where a legally enforceable right of set off exists.

**Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, credit and debit card receivables, short-term deposits and
short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. In the vast majority of
cases, credit and debit card receivables are settled on the first working day after the Balance Sheet date.

**Trade and other payables**
Trade and other payables, other than intercompany loans, are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal
value.

**Borrowing costs**
Borrowing costs are recognised in the Group’s Income Statement except for costs that are directly attributable to
the construction of buildings which are capitalised and included within the initial cost of a building.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when the property is ready for use. The interest rate applied is based on
the average rate of general borrowings outstanding during a period.

**Defined contribution pension plans**
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an operating expense in the
consolidated Income Statement as incurred.

**Defined benefit pension assets and liabilities**
The Group’s liabilities in respect of the Unapproved Unfunded Retirement Benefits Scheme ("UURBS") are
calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in
prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value. The calculation is performed by a
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

The expense relating to the unwind of the discount on the liabilities is recognised within finance costs.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income
in the period in which they occur.

**Investments**
In the Group's financial statements, investments in subsidiaries which are not consolidated are stated at cost less
amounts written off. Provision against the underlying value of the investments in subsidiary undertakings is
made where, in the opinion of the Directors, there is impairment to the value of the underlying business.

_Investments- unquoted equity_
The fair value of unquoted equity investments is determined using a market (or "income") approach. Any
change in the fair value of these investments is recognised in the Income Statement.

**Dividend distributions**
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Revenue recognition**
_Revenue from store and online sales_
Revenue represents sales to customers through retail outlets and online, excluding value added tax. Revenue is
recognised net of customer returns, ASDA Rewards pounds earned, intercompany transactions, colleague and
Blue Light discounts, coupons and the free element of multi-save transactions. Revenue is recognised at the
point at which the Group has satisfied its performance obligations under a contract with the customer and
control of the goods has passed to the customer. For non-fuel and fuel revenue generated through customer sales
in retail outlets and online, proceeds are recovered from the customer either immediately through the receipt of
cash at the point of sale or on settlement of card transactions which occurs one working day after the point of
sale in the vast majority of cases. For store sales, revenue is recognised at the point of sale as that is the point at
which the Directors determine that control of the goods has passed to the customer. For online sales, revenue is
recognised at the point of despatch of goods to the customer (for goods delivered directly from the Group’s
fulfilment centres to customers) or collection of goods by the customer (where customers utilise Click &
Collect) as this is the point at which the Directors determine that control of the goods has passed to the
customer.

_Wholesale revenue - Grocery_
The Group engages in wholesale of grocery items to third party wholesale partners who subsequently sell these
goods to third party customers in their own retail outlets. As part of these arrangements, the Group receives
goods from third party suppliers into its distribution network and assumes responsibility for delivery of goods to
the retail outlets of the wholesale partners. The Group also assumes inventory risk for the period from supplier
deliveries of goods into the Group’s distribution network to the point at which delivery of goods to wholesale
partners’ retail sites is completed. Wholesale revenue is recognised when goods are delivered to the wholesale
customers’ retail outlets as this is the point at which the Group has satisfied its performance obligations under its
contracts with the wholesale partners. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the Directors consider that the
Group is acting as principal in the sale of goods to wholesale partners and as such, revenue is recognised on a
gross basis, net of VAT, according to the consideration received by the Group from the wholesale partners.

Since the Group established control over its principal wholesale partner - Euro Garages Limited - on 31 October
2023, wholesale revenue recognised in revenue by a subsidiary of the Group (ASDA Stores Limited) in respect
of sales to Euro Garages Limited has been eliminated on consolidation within the Group financial statements.
As such, revenue included in the consolidated Income Statement since that date relating to goods delivered to
Euro Garages Limited by ASDA Stores Limited represents sales to third party customers by Euro Garages
Limited which is recognised in line with the policy on revenue from store sales as set out above.

_Wholesale revenue - Fuel_
The Group acts as an agent on behalf of certain wholesale partners in the procurement of fuel for sale in the
retail outlets of those partners. Under these arrangements, fuel is delivered directly to the retail outlets of the
wholesale partners by third party suppliers. The Group settles liabilities to third party fuel suppliers in respect of
these purchases and is reimbursed by wholesale partners for payments to the third-party suppliers, including a
commission. The Group does not take physical ownership of fuel delivered to wholesale partners through these
arrangements, has no direct involvement in the distribution of the fuel inventory between the third-party
suppliers and the wholesale partners and assumes no inventory risk. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the
Directors consider that the Group is acting as an agent and accordingly, revenue is recognised on a net basis
according to the value of the commission received by the Group from the wholesale partners, excluding VAT.
Commission revenue is recognised at the point that the Group determines that the third-party suppliers have
delivered fuel to the sites of the wholesale partners as that it the point at which the Group recognises a liability
to the third-party supplier for the fuel and simultaneously is the point at which the Group becomes entitled to
reimbursement by the wholesale partner. As such, that is the point at which the directors determine that the
Group has satisfied its contractual performance obligations to the wholesale partners.

Since the Group established control over its principal wholesale partner - Euro Garages Limited - on 31 October
2023, commission revenue recognised in revenue by a subsidiary of the Group (ASDA Stores Limited) in
respect of fuel delivered directly by third-party suppliers to Euro Garages Limited sites has been eliminated on
consolidation within the Group financial statements.

_Interest and dividend income_
Interest income is recognised in the Income Statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Dividend income is recognised in the Company's profit on the date the Company’s right to receive payments is
established.

_Income from concessions and commissions_
Income from concessions and commissions is based on the terms of the contract and is included within other
income (see note 4 for further detail).

**Supplier income**
Supplier incentives, rebates, fixed income and discounts (collectively known as “supplier income”) are
recognised, as a deduction from cost of inventories recognised as an expense, as they accrue in accordance with
the terms of each relevant supplier agreement. All supplier income is supported by agreements and, in the
majority of instances, these agreements begin and end within the Group’s financial year. In a small number of
instances, contractual periods may extend over the Group’s year end. In such cases the amount of any income
accrued in relation to these agreements is supported by detailed calculations.

Supplier income is split into three classifications:

- Supplier incentives and discounts - which are usually expressed in the supplier agreement as an agreed
amount per item sold. This type of supplier income is mechanically calculated and therefore no judgement is
required in determining the amount of income to record in the financial year;

- Annual supplier rebates - these are earned and billed within the Group’s financial year in the majority of
cases. The rebates are linked to pre-agreed volumes of sales or purchases of specific products and are
supported by explicit contractual terms; and,

- Fixed amount supplier income - this is earned and billed within the Group’s financial year in the majority of
cases. Fixed monetary amounts are agreed with suppliers relating to certain promotional activities including,
for example, new product listings, increased product distribution or specific promotional events.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Unbilled amounts of income to which the Group is contractually entitled are included in trade and other
receivables. Billed amounts unpaid at the year-end are included in trade receivables or offset against
corresponding trade payables where a contractual right of offset exists.

Supplier income recognised in the Income Statement and accounted for within trade receivables at the year-end
for which estimation and judgement is required is £0.9m (2022: £1.2m). This represents the net amount of
accrued income of £0.9m (2022: £1.2m) and deferred income of £nil (2022: £nil) on deals running across the
year-end.

**Share-based payments**
For liabilities arising from share-based payment arrangements the Group has applied IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based
Payments’.

During the prior year, management shares in the immediate parent company of the Group were issued to eligible
members of senior management employed by the Group as part of a Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) in
exchange for proceeds determined by an independent calculation of fair value at the issue date. Under the MIP,
an intermediate holding company of the Group - Bellis Midco 2 Limited - has entered into an agreement with
the holders of MIP management shares (“MIP scheme members”) whereby MIP scheme members are granted a
put option which, when exercised, enables them to sell their management shares to Bellis Midco 2 Limited or
another non-Group entity for a value determined by an independent valuation determined at the exercise date.

MIP scheme members are required to be employed by the Group at the grant date of the MIP shares. If a
member of the scheme ceases to be employed by the Group during the vesting period, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, a
parent of Bellis Finco PLC, has the option to repurchase, or nominate another entity of the Group to repurchase,
the shares during the 12 month period after the member’s leave date. As such, the Directors have determined
that the MIP scheme falls within the scope of IFRS 2. The difference between the IFRS 2 fair value and the fair
value paid by MIP scheme members at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period (i.e. the period from
date on which the MIP shares are granted to the estimated exercise date) as an expense in the consolidated
Income Statement.

As neither MIP shares nor put options over MIP shares are issued by entities within the Group, and as there is
no recharge agreement in place which requires any entity within the Group to settle liabilities in respect of MIP
shares, changes in the fair value of MIP shares are accounted for on an equity-settled basis.

**Reimbursement assets**
Where it is virtually certain that the Group will be reimbursed by a third party for part or all of the expenditure
required to settle a provision then it recognises the reimbursement as a separate reimbursement asset. The
amount recognised for the reimbursement is based on the amount that the Group is expected to be reimbursed
limited to the amount of the provision recognised. In the Consolidated Income Statement, the reimbursement
amount is presented separately within Reimbursement Income.

**Contingent liabilities**
The Group may, from time to time, be subject to legal proceedings. Where a liability is not probable or the
amount cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recognised. However, where a loss is not considered
probable but a liability is possible and may be material, such matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities.

**2** **Business Combinations**

_Arthur Foodstores Limited_
On 30 October 2022, ASDA Stores Limited ("ASDA Stores") agreed to purchase 100% of the entire issued
share capital of Arthur Foodstores Limited ('Arthur Foodstores'). The acquisition will support and accelerate
ASDA’s existing strategy to expand in the convenience market.

An Initial Enforcement Order (IEO) was served by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on 30
October 2022, which restricted the Group’s ability to run or make changes to Arthur Foodstores. On 14 March
2023, the CMA issued its findings which stated that the acquisition may result in a substantial lessening of
competition in certain areas. On 28 March 2023, undertakings were offered to the CMA which involved
divesting of 13 petrol filling stations. On 30 May 2023 these undertakings were accepted by the CMA, and the
IEO was lifted other than for the 13 petrol filling stations. Control is deemed to have transferred to ASDA
Stores on 30 May 2023 and Arthur Foodstores has been consolidated from this date. See note 1 for further
detail.

The consideration transferred was £457.4m. This comprises cash consideration of £228.6m which was settled by
ASDA Stores on 28 October 2022, further consideration funded by issue of a bridge loan for net proceeds of
£195.0m (£200.0m loan less £5.0m bank fees) which was drawn down on 28 October 2022, further cash
consideration of £4.4m which was settled by ASDA Stores on 24 May 2023 and payables novated from the
seller of £29.4m.

**2** **Business Combinations (continued)**

Costs directly relating to completion of the business combinations in the period since legal completion in
October 2022 of £6.7m were included in operating costs in the prior year consolidated Income Statement and
£3.2m have been expensed in the current year. These acquisition-related costs include stamp duty and advisory
fees in respect of legal, accounting, property valuation and other professional matters.

For the year ended 31 December 2023, Arthur Foodstores Limited contributed revenue of £587.8m and loss
before tax of £5.9m to the Group’s results. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023, management
estimates that consolidated revenue for the year ended 31 December 2023 would have been £26,012.7m, and the
consolidated profit before tax for the twelve-month period would have been £191.2m. In determining these
amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, that arose on the date of acquisition would
have been materially the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023.

**2** **Business Combinations (continued)**

_Business combinations - acquisition date relating to the Group's purchase of the share capital of Euro Garages_
_(Jersey) Limited_

On 31 October 2023, Project America Bidco Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco PLC, acquired
100% of the entire issued share capital of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited from EG Finco Limited, a related party
of the Group for consideration of £2.025bn on a debt-free basis. The acquisition will support and accelerate
ASDA's existing strategy to expand in the convenience market. Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited and its
subsidiaries are consolidated within the Group from this date.

The cash consideration transferred as of 31 December 2023 of £2,000.1m and professional and bank fees
transferred of £109m were funded through a combination of a £401m subordinated shareholder loan, a £684m
private placement, £646m of proceeds from a sale and leaseback transaction, a £290m bridge loan and £88m of
cash on balance sheet. The bridge loan was refinanced via a further ground rent property transaction which
completed on 12 December 2023 for proceeds of £400m. After repaying the bridge loan, the remaining proceeds
from the ground rent transaction were retained on the balance sheet and in part used to settle transaction fees.
Estimated deferred consideration of £25.3m has been included in trade and other payables at 31 December 2023.
Settlement of deferred consideration is expected to be funded by cash on balance sheet.

At completion, the Group entered into a number of arrangements with EG Finco Limited, including a
Transitional Services Agreement (TSA), an integration support arrangement and lease agreements for properties
owned or leased by the Group from which subsidiaries of EG Finco Limited continue to operate franchise
foodservice and electric vehicle charging businesses post-acquisition. These arrangements were all negotiated
concurrently with the acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited, are interdependent with the terms of the
acquisition, and were negotiated as a single transaction. The Directors have assessed that purchase price agreed
with the seller of £2.07bn and the terms of the transaction as being on an arm’s length basis. The purchase price
of £2.07bn is prior to adjustments for working capital and net debt as outlined in the sale and purchase
agreement.

Under the TSA, a subsidiary of EG Finco Limited will provide Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited and its
subsidiaries with IT and other centralised services for an initial term of two years. During this initial term, these
services are provided at £nil cost to the Group, subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, EG Finco
Limited has also agreed for a period of two years to reimburse the Group for certain centralised costs which
transferred as part of the transaction perimeter and are required to support the acquired business. This
arrangement is not considered to be part of the business combination and therefore, £27.3m of the consideration
transferred has been allocated to the TSA arrangement based on the fair value of the services provided
subsidiaries of EG Finco Limited and the estimated costs to be recharged by the Group to EG Finco Limited.
This has been recognised within prepayments and will be recognised within operating expenses in the
Consolidated Income Statement over the initial two-year term of the TSA. The carrying value of the prepayment
at 31 December 2023 is £25.0m.

Under the integration support arrangement, the Group and EG Finco Limited entered into an agreement whereby
EG Finco Limited would support the costs associated with the integration of the acquisition by the Group for a
fixed amount of £11.3m over two years with the payments made quarterly. The full amount has been recorded
as an adjustment to the purchase consideration and recognised within Other Debtors. The carrying amount of the
receivable at 31 December 2023 is £11.3m.

The Group has entered into a number of lease arrangements with subsidiaries of EG Finco Limited at
completion relating to properties owned or leased by the Group. A number of these lease arrangements have
been classified as finance leases and a finance lease receivable has been recognised on acquisition with respect
to these leases. The carrying value of the finance lease receivable at 31 December 2023 is disclosed in note 13.
For leases which are classified as operating leases, the rentals recognised through the income statement in the
year and the amounts outstanding at 31 December 2023 are disclosed in note 30.

The fair value of acquired receivables is materially equal to the contractual amounts receivable.

The fair value adjustments to the assets and liabilities assumed are final. The total consideration remains
provisional at the balance date and is management’s best estimate at this time. Consideration will be finalised
once completion accounts are agreed with the seller. Any adjustments to consideration arising out the agreement
of the completion accounts will be taken to goodwill.

Costs directly relating to completion of the business combination of £53.2m have been included in operating
costs in the Consolidated Income Statement in the current year.

For the year-ended 31 December 2023, Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited contributed revenue of £410.9m and
profit before tax of £17.7m to the Group’s results. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023,
management estimates that consolidated revenue for the year-ended 31 December 2023 would have been
£27,551.0m and the consolidated profit before tax would have been £251.4m. In determining these amounts,
management has assumed that the fair value adjustments which arose on the date of acquisition would have been
materially the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023.

**3** **Segment reporting**

The Group is engaged in a single reportable operating segment of business, being the retailing of food, clothing,
general merchandise, fuel and services in a single geographical segment, the United Kingdom and online. The
Group is not reliant on any individual major customers.

In line with the Group’s reporting framework and management structure, key operating decisions are made by
the Executive Committee of ASDA Group Limited which is considered to be the Chief Operating Decision
Maker for the Group. All significant revenue is generated by the sale of goods through retail outlets in the UK
and through the Group's online channels. The operations of all product areas of the business are subject to
similar economic characteristics and are sold in a similar retail environment.

The Group has taken these factors into account together with the core principles of IFRS 8 in determining that it
has a single reportable operating segment.

The analysis of the Group's revenue for the year from continuing operations is as follows:

**Year ended 31** **Year ended 31**
**December 2023** **December 2022**
**£m** **£m**
Sale of goods 21,898.4 20,452.3
Fuel 3,718.5 4,025.5

**£m** **£m**
Concession and commission income 57.2 57.5
Rental income 13.7 12.3
Total other income 70.9 69.8

Concession and commission income mainly relates to commission income earned through concessions and
in-store variable rental income.

Rental income relates to income earned by the Group as a lessor from sites located in the proximity of certain
stores. In the prior year, £12.3m of rental income which was previously netted against operating costs has been
included in other income.

Other income disclosed in note 4 of the 2022 financial statements was £42.5m. Following a detailed review,
amounts totalling £15.0m which were previously netted against operating costs have been included in the
amount in the table above of £57.5m to better reflect their nature.

included elements of other income, mainly related to concessions, commission and rental income. These
elements have now been included within Other income to better reflect the nature of these items (note 4) and the
prior year Income Statement presentation has been restated as a result.

As detailed in note 1, the Group has updated its accounting policy in respect of application of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets. Accordingly, impairment charges for the prior year have been restated in the table above.

_(i) Other operating costs include various expenses associated with operating the business. These include but are_
_not limited to business rates, property maintenance, energy and utility costs, marketing expenses and insurance._

**Non-underlying items**

**5** **Operating costs (continued)**

(i) Relates to third-party advisory fees incurred during the year in respect of the acquisition of Euro Garages
(Jersey) Limited.

(ii) Since the acquisition of ASDA Group Limited in the period ended 31 December 2021, the Group has
embarked on a programme, Project Future, to separate its IT systems from its previous owner Walmart. A
Transitional Services Agreement ("TSA") is in place with Walmart. The separation programme will transition
the Group to a standalone, leading edge IT infrastructure which will enable it to improve operating efficiencies,
make better use of data, improve experience for customers and colleagues, and enable the business to be more
agile in responding to customers’ needs.

Amounts classified as non-underlying during the current year and prior year relate to costs incurred outside the
normal course of business in respect of research spend, design and build costs relating to IT infrastructure and
SAAS solutions which cannot be capitalised (see note 1 for further detail), consultancy costs incurred in relation
to the management of the programme, run costs relating to standalone systems where equivalent legacy Walmart
systems are still in use by the business, and costs of interim software solutions which do not meet the criteria of
the Group's policy to capitalise (see note 1 for further detail).

Where legacy Walmart systems are still in use, the costs of these are included in charges relating to the TSA.
The total IT spend included in underlying operating costs reflects management’s expectation of the level of
annual spend required to operate the business on standalone IT systems in the normal course of business which
includes the charges incurred under the TSA and a proportion of Project Future costs.

(iii) Reimbursed settlement relating to historic tax reliefs: As detailed in note 11, the Group's tax and interest
liabilities to the tax authorities arising out of settlement of this matter were settled in full in the prior year by a
fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent of ASDA Holdings UK Limited ("AHUKL" - the former
immediate parent of ASDA Group Limited). This satisfied AHUKL's obligations to the Group arising out of this
matter as set out in the sale and purchase agreement relating to the Group's acquisition of ASDA and as such,
there were no cashflow impacts on the Group during the prior year or current year.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**10 Sale-and-Leaseback transaction**

On 10 August 2023, the Group entered into a sale-and-leaseback of 22 of its properties. Further
sale-and-leasebacks for three properties were completed on 30 August 2023, 13 September 2023 and 15
November 2023 respectively. The properties were sold at fair value to a third party.

In accordance with IFRS 15, it was determined that the transfer of the properties to an independent third party
for proceeds of £645.6m is considered a sale. In the period ended 31 December 2023, assets relating to the
properties with a Net Book Value of £625.7m were sold and the Group has recognised a gain on sale of £3.3m
representing the amount of the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The remaining gain
of £16.6m is deferred as a reduction to the right-of-use assets relating to the leaseback.

Similarly, the cash proceeds arising from the sale-and-leaseback transaction have been separately classified as
investing (£136.2m) to reflect the relative proportion of the proceeds relating to the transfer of rights to the
buyer-lessor with the remaining proceeds classified as financing (£509.4m).

These properties were leased back to the Group on terms of 35 years (including the assumption that leases will
be extended by 10 years). The Group continues to lease these properties from entities controlled by the Buyer
and has adjusted the right of use assets and lease liabilities to reflect amended terms of the leases on transfer to
the third-party entities at that date.

The leasebacks of the properties, taking into account the deferral of a proportion of the disposal gain into the
right-of-use asset and subsequent modification to the lease term, resulted in an increase in right-of-use assets of
£492.8m and lease liabilities of £509.4m.

Total tax credit

The standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom for the year ended 31 December 2023 is 23.52%
(2022: 19%). On 1 April 2023, the standard rate of corporation tax increased to 25%. The deferred tax liability
is calculated using the tax rate at which it is expected to unwind of 25%.

(a) The prior year current tax expense in 2022 includes £40.3m relating to corporation tax reliefs claimed in the
years ending 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2017. This tax together with interest of £9.0m was reimbursed
by ASDA Holdings UK Limited (“AHUKL”) – a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walmart Inc. - under an
indemnity it provided to the Group when AHUKL sold its interest in ASDA Group Limited on 16 February
2021. The total reimbursement income of £49.3m was included as reimbursement income in the income
statement. This is non-taxable income for the Group. AHUKL settled this tax and interest directly on the
Group's behalf and as such, no amounts are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in respect of
the settlement or the reimbursement.

In May 2023, amendments were made to IAS 12 for income taxes. These amendments provide companies with a
temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impact of the top-up tax, and introduce
disclosure requirements in relation to Pillar Two.

Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group
operates. The legislation is effective for the Group’s financial year beginning 1 January 2024. The Group has
performed an assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes.

This assessment is based on the most recent information available regarding the financial performance of the
constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment performed, the transitional safe harbour relief applies.
Therefore, the Group does not expect an exposure to Pillar Two top-up taxes.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**11 Taxation (continued)**

The opening deferred tax liability includes the restatement for impairments, resulting in a reduction in the
opening deferred tax liability of £65.2m. In addition, following amendments to IAS12, deferred tax liabilities in
relation to right of use assets and deferred tax assets in relation to lease liabilities have been separately
disclosed. The deferred tax asset in relation to dilapidation provisions of £9.1m (2022: £7.1m) has been
reclassified from property, plant and equipment to provisions within the deferred tax disclosure note.

A net deferred tax liability of £42.3m arose on the acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Limited, and a net deferred
tax liability of £237.4m arose on the acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited and subsidiaries.

Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise
to deferred tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered, with the exception of certain
capital losses.

A deferred tax asset of £69.3m (2022: £99.0m) has been recognised in relation to trading losses carried forward
of £277.0m (2022 restated: £400.0m). A deferred tax asset of £82.9m (2022: £68.0m) is also recognised in
relation to disallowed interest carried forward under the UK Corporate Interest Restriction of £332.0m (2022:
£272.0m). The utilisation of these assets is dependent upon future taxable profits, which we expect to arise
through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. These attributes can be carried forward
indefinitely.

Capital losses carried forward at 31 December 2023 are £66.7m, for which a deferred tax asset of £3.1m is
recognised. No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of £54.7m of these losses. As at 31 December 2022,
capital losses were £68.6m, for which a deferred tax asset of £6.1m was recognised. No deferred tax asset was
recognised in respect of £44.5m of these losses. Capital losses are not recognised where, at the balance sheet
date, it is not considered probable that the losses will be used.

The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in relation to unrealised capital losses on land. The unrealised
loss on land is £1,606.4m (2022: £1,775.9m). The movement in the year is due to the reversal of land
impairments, the sale-and-leaseback disposals (see note 10 for further detail on the sale-and-leaseback
transaction), partially offset by the acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Limited. A deferred tax asset is not
recognised as it is not considered probable that the losses could be used once realised.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**12 Property, plant and equipment (continued)**

**Investment properties**
The Group acquired £39.1m of investment properties on acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited, all of
which was freehold land. The cost model is applied to these investment properties. The estimated fair value of
these properties is considered to be equal to the carrying value due to the proximity of the acquisition date to the
balance sheet date.

**Impairment**
In accordance with IAS 36, the Group has assessed each store CGU against the following impairment triggers to
determine whether there is an indicator of impairment:

a) Negative cashflows (after allocation of all relevant central costs) generated by CGUs in the preceding twelve
months
b) Adverse cashflow performance against budget and year-on-year cashflow deterioration
c) Specific CGU qualitative factors such as environmental damage and store closure

For each store CGU that has shown an indicator of impairment as at 31 December 2023, the Group has
calculated a value-in-use model.

The value-in-use is calculated using the following methodology:

- Estimates of future cashflow performance - the cash flow models are prepared based on the Group’s one- and
three-year planning process and are extrapolated beyond three years using estimated long term average growth
rate of 2.0%

- The assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts reflect management’s current climate strategy

- Discount rate - the pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow projections are between 8.1% and 8.9%
(2022: 8.2% - 8.6%)

- Allocation of all relevant central costs to each location on a reasonable and consistent basis

Management have also considered the fair value of each CGU. For Freehold sites a vacant possession valuation
was performed with the support of external property valuers. Key estimates in these valuations include market
rental and yield assumptions.

As discussed in note 1, the Directors have undertaken a detailed review of the Group’s application of IAS 36
Impairment of Assets and updated the Group accounting policy in relation to testing for impairment of
long-lived assets which has resulted in a prior year restatement of impairment recognised in the 2022
comparative period.

This results in a pre-tax impairment charge at 31 December 2022 of £377.4m (comprising £232.8m of property,
plant and equipment impairment and £144.6m of right-of-use asset impairment (see note 13)) of which £357.5m
was not previously recorded in the 2022 financial statements and a net pre-tax impairment reversal of £225.7m
(comprising £148.9m of property, plant and equipment impairment and £76.8m of right-of-use asset impairment
(see note 13)) being recorded in the Income Statement in 2023. This is consistent with a material year on year
improvement in the Group’s financial performance in 2023 and an improvement in the Directors’ outlook of
future cashflows compared to equivalent forecasts at 31 December 2022.

The Group have considered the risks and opportunities facing the business in assessing the sensitivities to the
value in use calculation and determined that the calculation is most sensitive to change in the discount rate and
long-term growth rate:

_Discount rate_

- For the year ended 31 December 2022, an increase in the discount rate by 1%, would result in an additional
impairment of £51.7m and a decrease in the discount rate by 1%, would result in a reduction in the impairment
for the year ended 31 December 2022 of £48.5m.


-----

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**12 Property, plant and equipment (continued)**

- For the year ended 31 December 2023, an increase in the discount rate by 1%, would result in a decrease in the
impairment reversal of £32.2m and a decrease in the discount rate by 1%, would result in an increase in the
impairment reversal of £29.4m.

_Terminal growth rate_

- For the year ended 31 December 2022, an increase in the terminal growth rate by 1%, would result in a
decrease of £49.5m in the impairment and a 1% decrease would result in an increase in the impairment of
£51.4m.

- For the year ended 31 December 2023, an increase in the terminal growth rate by 1%, would result in an
increase in the impairment reversal of £29.1m and a 1% decrease would result in a reduction in the impairment
reversal of £29.9m.

**Reclassification from intangible assets**
In 2023 the Directors identified that hardware assets with a net book value of £39.2m were originally classified
as intangible assets. These have been reclassified to plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings during the year. There
has been no change to the useful economic life of these assets and as such this reclassification has had no impact
on the consolidated income statement.

**Disposals**
The Group disposed of net book value of assets of £626.2m (2022: £78.1m) which predominantly relates to the
sale-and-leaseback of 25 properties that completed in 2023. See note 10 for further details of this transaction.

**Assets held for Sale**
Assets relating to a distribution property with a net book value of £20.5m were classified as held for sale at the
year ended 31 December 2023. See note 14 for further details.

**13 Right-of-use assets (continued)**

The Group leases various offices, stores, warehouses, vehicles and equipment under agreements within the
scope of IFRS 16.

Leases of land and buildings have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights, however they commonly
include either a market rent review or index linked rent review with a cap and collar. The timing of when rent
reviews take place differs for each lease. They have no purchase options.

As discussed in note 1, the Directors have undertaken a detailed review of the Group’s application of IAS 36
Impairment of Assets and updated the Group accounting policy in relation to testing for impairment of
long-lived assets which has resulted in a prior year restatement of impairment recognised in the 2022
comparative period.

This results in a pre-tax impairment charge allocated to right-of-use assets at 31 December 2022 of £144.6m, of
which £137.7m was not previously recorded in the financial statements and a net pre-tax impairment reversal of
£76.8m being recorded in the Income Statement in 2023. See note 1 and note 12 for further details on
impairment policy and assumptions.

In determining the impairment of right-of-use assets management have calculated the fair value of right-of-use
assets using a discounted market rental approach to determine the recoverable amount of the asset. This
approach requires an estimates of market rentals using assumptions on market participant demand and rental
yields alongside a discount rate which is determined in line with the Group’s incremental borrowing rate under
IFRS 16.

For details of sensitivity analysis of impairment charges see note 12.

Average remaining lease term is 35 years (2022: 37 years).

Leases of plant, vehicles and equipment have various terms but typically do not include mid-term rent reviews
or extension options. They have no purchase options. The average remaining lease term is 4 years (2022: 4
years).

Additions during the year relate primarily to the sale-and-leaseback of 25 stores (see note 10); renewals or
modifications of previously existing leases for land and buildings; and new leases for plant, vehicles and
equipment.

For further details of lease liabilities please see note 27.

_Distribution property held for sale_

During the year ended 31 December 2023, a non-operating distribution property with a carrying value of
£20.5m was reclassified as held for sale within current assets. It was determined that this asset met the criteria
for being classed as held for sale. The asset held for sale has been recognised at fair value less cost to sell.

_Disposal of Arthur Foodstores Limited (“Arthur”) stores_

On 30 May 2023, the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) accepted undertakings to dispose of 13
stores owned by Arthur Foodstores Limited for which it expected a substantial lessening of competition were
the Group to own and operate these stores. These 13 stores have been classified as held for sale from 30 May
2023 as the Directors have determined that:

- the stores are available for immediate sale in their present condition; and

- the sale is highly probable as the stores are being actively marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to
their estimated current fair values and;

- there is an expectation that the sales process will be completed within one year from the date of classification.

As the store assets were recognised as held for sale on acquisition, they have been recognised at fair value less
cost to sell.

In the year ended 31 December 2023, 2 of the 13 properties previously held for sale had been disposed of and a
£6.6m loss, including allocated goodwill of £6.5m, was recognised on sale.

The major classes of assets and liabilities of Arthur Foodstores Limited classified as held for sale as at 31
December 2023 are included in the table above.

**15 Intangible assets (continued)**

**Reclassification to Property, Plant & Equipment**
In 2023 the Directors identified that hardware assets with a net book value of £39.2m were originally classified
as intangible assets. These have been reclassified to plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings during the year. There
has been no change to the useful economic life of these assets and as such this reclassification has had no impact
on the consolidated income statement.

**Impairment testing of indefinite life intangibles**

**_George brand licence and ASDA Brand_**
These assets relate to the acquisition in 2021 of a perpetual licence to use the George brand in the UK and
elsewhere in Europe with a carrying value of £463.8m (2022: £463.8m), and the ASDA brand which has a
carrying value of £863.4m (2022: £863.4m). These brands have been tested for impairment as at 31 December
2023 in combination with other long-lived assets utilised in the ASDA and George business by assessing the
present value of forecasted cash flows arising from the business.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from
financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period.

For cashflows arising out of the grocery, clothing and general merchandising activities of the business, forecasts
are extrapolated beyond three years using estimated long term average growth rates. The pre-tax discount rate
applied to the cash flow projections is 8.9% (post-tax 6.7%) alongside a long term growth rate of 2.0%.

For cashflows arising out of ASDA’s fuel retailing business, the cashflow forecast includes an assumed decline
in sales volumes beyond the three-year forecast with an accompanying unwind of working capital over the
medium term due to an expected transition to alternative fuel vehicles. In line with guidance in IAS 36, these
forecasts do not include cashflows arising out of expansionary capital expenditure. The pre-tax discount rate
applied to the fuel retailing cash flow projections is 11.4% (post-tax 8.5%).

Based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis undertaken, management believe that no reasonably
possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be lower than the
carrying value of the brands and other long-lived assets used in the ASDA and George business.

Please refer to note 13 of the 2022 financial statements for details of methodology and key assumptions included
in the prior year impairment testing of the George and ASDA brand intangibles.

**15 Intangible assets (continued)**

**_Goodwill arising on acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Limited_**
As set out in note 2, during the year, the Group obtained control of Arthur Foodstores Limited (“Arthur”) with
goodwill arising of £290.5m, of which £30.4m has since been allocated to assets held for sale. This goodwill has
been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2023 in combination with other long-lived assets utilised in the
Arthur business by assessing the present value of forecasted cash flows arising from the business.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from
financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period.

In line with guidance in IAS 36, these forecasts do not include cashflows arising out of expansionary capital
expenditure. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 11.4% (post-tax 8.5%).

For cashflows arising out of Arthur’s grocery convenience retailing business, cashflows included in the initial
three-year forecast are extrapolated to five years based on management's expectations and beyond five years
using estimated long term average growth rates. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is
11.4% (post-tax 8.5%) alongside a long term growth rate of 2.0%.

Based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis undertaken, management believe that no reasonably
possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be lower than the
carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets used in the Arthur business.

**_Goodwill arising on acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited_**
As set out in note 2, during the year, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Euro Garages (Jersey)
Limited (“EG(J)L”) with goodwill arising of £922.1m. This goodwill has been tested for impairment as at 31
December 2023 in combination with other long-lived assets utilised in the EG(J)L business by assessing the
present value of forecasted cash flows arising from the business.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from
financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period.

In line with guidance in IAS 36, these forecasts do not include cashflows arising out of expansionary capital
expenditure. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 11.4% (post-tax 8.5%).

For cashflows arising out of EG(J)L’s grocery convenience retailing business, cashflows have been forecast
over the same medium term period as fuel cashflows with a terminal value calculated at the end of that period
using estimated long term average growth rates. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is
11.4% (post-tax 8.5%). A long term growth rate of 2.0% has been used in the calculation of the terminal value.

Based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis undertaken, management believe that no reasonably
possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be lower than the
carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets used in the EG(J)L business.

_Prior year - Acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Limited by Asda Stores Limited - a wholly owned subsidiary of_
_Bellis Finco PLC_

On 29 October 2022, Asda Stores Limited - a wholly owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco PLC - purchased 100%
of the share capital of Arthur Foodstores Limited, a grocery retailer operating in the United Kingdom for an
initial purchase price of £461.8m. This comprised initial cash consideration of £423.6m, of which £228.6m was
funded from cash in hand and £195.0m was raised through the issue of additional senior facilities of £200.0m,
less bank fees of £5.0m; and a loan balance owing to Arthur Foodstores Limited of £38.2m. Prior to completion
of the acquisition, the seller owed a balance of £38.2m to Arthur Foodstores Limited. This liability was novated
to the Group on completion at 29 October 2022 as part of the Sale and Purchase Agreement.

The final purchase price for Arthur Foodstores Limited was £457.4m, as a result of a £4.4m post-completion
adjustment comprising a reduction of £8.8m in the Group's payable to Arthur Foodstores Limited offset by
£4.4m additional cash consideration which was paid prior to 30 May 2023, when control was deemed to have
transferred to the Group.

On 26 October 2022 the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order
(“IEO”) under section 72 (2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Asda Stores Limited; Asda Group Limited; Mr
Mohsin Issa; Mr Zuber Issa; TDR Capital LLP; TDR Capital III Portfolio No. 2 L.P.; TDR Capital III
Investments (2019) L.P.; Co-operative Group Limited and Arthur Foodstores Limited. The IEO commenced on
30 October 2022. The IEO required the Group to hold separate the Arthur business. An independent
management team was appointed to run the Arthur business during the IEO period and the parties were
prohibited from performing any integration activities or exchanging of commercially sensitive information.

At 31 December 2022, as a result of the IEO restrictions, the Group concluded that it did not have control of
Arthur Foodstores Limited and therefore the results of the business were not consolidated in the 2022 financial
statements.

On 14 March 2023 the CMA delivered its Phase 1 decision in respect of its investigation into the Group’s
acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Ltd. They identified 13 potential areas for competition concern, with the
potential for local remedies. The Group offered to dispose of the 13 sites in question.

On 30 May 2023 these undertakings were accepted by the CMA, and the IEO was lifted. Control is deemed to
have transferred to the Group on 30 May 2023 and Arthur Foodstores has been consolidated from this date in
these financial statements.

Trade receivables are non interest-bearing and are generally on 30 day terms. Trade receivable balances have
been assessed to determine the value of expected credit losses ("ECLs") using the simplified approach in IFRS
9.

Trade receivables are presented net where a legally enforceable right of set off exists. The Group routinely
recovers receivables from suppliers with which a legal right of offset exists by settling payables with those
suppliers on a net basis at the earliest point following the balance sheet date at which payables of a value equal
to or in excess of the receivable amount are due for settlement. Included in the above is an offset of £190.4m
(2022: £166.1m). The trade receivable prior to the offset is £317.8m (2022: £260.8m).

Other receivable balances have been assessed to determine the value of ECLs as per the requirements of IFRS 9
and the impact is less than £0.1m (2022: less than £0.1m).

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**18 Trade, other receivables and derivative assets (continued)**

The Group considers its trade and other receivables in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due.
However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a trade or other receivable to be in default when internal
or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full
before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A trade or other receivable is written off
to the Consolidated Income Statement when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual
cash flows.

The non-current intercompany receivable balance of £773.2m (2022: £747.4m) has arisen largely from the
sale-and-leaseback transaction that occurred in 2021, as properties owned by the Group were sold to a fellow
wholly-owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent undertaking in exchange for an intercompany receivable balance
for which the counterparty is Bellis Midco 2 Limited - a fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent,
which itself owns a 100% interest in the Group. This receivable matures on 23 June 2026 and attracts on interest
rate of 3.45%. See note 30 for further detail.

In order to assess the probability of default and to determine the value of expected credit losses in respect of the
Group’s intercompany receivables, the directors have modelled an orderly settlement of all intercompany
balances between entities within the Group and entities outside the Group which are fellow wholly-owned
subsidiaries of the ultimate parent.

This analysis is based on the directors’ forecast of future cashflows. Downside sensitivities to the base case
assumptions within this forecast have been modelled and in all scenarios, the value of cashflows realised is
sufficient to enable full and orderly settlement of all balances. As such, the directors have determined that the
probability of default in relation to the Group’s intercompany receivables is remote and the impact of expected
credit losses is immaterial. Accordingly, the carrying value of the Group’s expected credit losses provision in
respect of intercompany receivables is less than £0.1m (2022: less than £0.1m).

In the prior year, loans receivable of £26.6m included a balance of £23.6m arising out of cash lent to Arthur
Foodstores Limited, largely in order to enable that entity to satisfy short-term working capital requirements; and
a further balance of £3.0m which was transferred to the Group on 29 October 2022. These balances were
assessed to determine the value of ECLs as per the requirements of IFRS 9 and the impact in the prior year was
less than £0.1m.

The remaining balance at 31 December 2023 has been eliminated in these financial statements as the results of
Arthur Foodstores Limited have been consolidated since 30 May 2023 (see note 2).

As at 31 December 2023, trade receivables at nominal value of £1.2m were impaired and fully provided for
(2022: £1.1m). Movements in the allowance for expected credit losses in the year were as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**

Group’s policy to abide by these terms when satisfactory invoices have been received.

Trade receivables are presented net where a legally enforceable right of offset exists. Included in the above is an
offset of £190.4m (2022: £166.1m). The trade payable prior to the offset is £3,931.5m (2022: £3,407.5m).

The £409.1m non-current shareholder loan balance comprises of a £401.0m subordinated shareholder loan used

**_Movements in liabilities arising from financing activities_**
External borrowings comprise the financing drawn down to fund the acquisition of ASDA Group Limited, a
loan entered into during the prior year to finance the acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Limited, which has been
repaid in full during the current year and loans entered into during the year to fund the acquisition of EG
Garages (Jersey) Limited. Further details of external borrowings are disclosed in note 22.

During the year, the Group extended the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) which was entered into in a previous
year, from a limit of £500.0m to a limit of £667.3m. The RCF expires in August 2025. The carrying amount of
RCF fees at 31 December 2023 was £5.5m, which includes £2.5m in relation to the RCF extension entered into
during the year (2022: £5.1m). Amortisation of £2.1m (2022: £2.1m) was charged in the year.

On 31 October 2023, the Group entered into a loan of £683.9m to part-fund the acquisition of Euro Garages
(Jersey) Limited (“EG”). This loan attracts interest per annum of 6.75% plus SONIA. The loan matures on 31
October 2029 and has therefore been classified as non-current. In addition, the Group entered into a bridge
facility of £290.0m to part-fund the acquisition of EG. The bridge facility attracted interest per annum of 7.0%
plus SONIA. The facility was repaid in full on 21 December 2023.

On 12 December 2023, the Group entered into a Corporate Ground Rent transaction and received a £400.0m
loan. The loan is split into Facility A and Facility B which attract interest per annum of 3.79% and 3.97%
respectively. The facility matures in December 2073 and has therefore been classified as non-current.

The £409.1m non-current shareholder loan balance comprises of a £401.0m subordinated shareholder loan used
to partially fund the acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited and £8.1m interest accrued on this balance.

Total lease cash outflow in the year was £350.3m (2022: £300.4m). Amounts included in financing activities in
the cash flow statement are cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability £148.5m (2022:
£131.9m) and cash payments for the interest portion of the lease liability of £175.9m (2022: £145.2m). £25.9m
(2022: £23.3m) has been included in operating activities in the cash flow statement and relates to short term and
variable lease expenses.

During the prior year, the Group had access to a facility that provided the Group with a credit facility pursuant
to which payment to the relevant beneficiaries and suppliers is made by ASDA Stores Limited using the facility
on the relevant invoice due date, with ASDA Stores Limited then settling these liabilities in the normal course of
business. An amount of £39.1m was outstanding on this facility at 31 December 2022 and was fully repaid
during the current year. The Group no longer utilises this facility and the balance at 31 December 2023 was £nil.

On 24 July 2022, the Group entered into a framework agreement in respect of a short-term financing facility.
The facility was unused as at 31 December 2022. The Group no longer has access to this facility.

Other movements in the current year are due primarily to the elimination on consolidation of a balance at
£41.0m at 31 December 2022 which was owed by the Group to Arthur Foodstores Limited ("Arthur"). The
results of Arthur have been consolidated since 30 May 2023 (see note 1 and note 2).

Other movements in the prior year relate primarily to non-cash settlement of an intercompany payable balance
using an intercompany receivable- see prior year financial statements for further detail.

**_Security pledged_**
In previous years, the Group pledged certain assets as security for the indebtedness of parent undertakings in the
form of a first-ranking charge over certain material bank accounts, material intercompany receivables, the shares
owned by the Group in ASDA Stores Limited, McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood House Group
Limited, and a first-ranking floating charge over all present and future assets (other than customarily excluded
assets) of ASDA Group Limited, ASDA Stores Limited, McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood
House Group Limited.

Part of the security pledged is in relation to some of the Group’s existing supply chain finance agreements in the
form of fixed and floating charges over certain of the Group’s assets. There were no other changes to the terms
of these supply chain finance agreements which impact on the nature of amounts owed to the bank under these
arrangements. Given consideration of this and the other factors set out in note 1, the Directors have concluded
that the substance of the Group’s liabilities under all supply chain financing agreements remain consistent
overall with that of a trade payable and accordingly will continue to be accounted for and classified as trade
payables.

On 13 August 2021, the Group entities that guarantee the Senior Secured Notes issued by Bellis Acquisition
Company PLC, the Term Loan Facilities and the Forecourt Bridge Facility borrowed by Bellis Acquisition
Company PLC and the Revolving Credit Facility made available to the Group granted first-priority security
interests over their Material Real Property to secure their obligations under those instruments. With the
completion of this security grant, the Group discharged the requirement to deliver post-closing collateral under
the various financing arrangements established in connection with the acquisition of ASDA by the Group. Upon
the issuance of additional Senior Secured Notes on 5 November 2021 by Bellis Acquisition Company PLC, the
Group is required to grant further first-priority security interests over their Material Real Property to secure their
obligations under these instruments. This grant of this security was completed on 5 May 2022.

On 29 October 2023, an additional fixed charge on the existing security pledged over certain material bank
accounts and the shares owned by the Group in ASDA Stores Limited, McLagan Investments Limited and The
Burwood House Group Limited was pledged in relation to the bridge facility agreement that was entered into by
Bellis Acquisition Company PLC on the same date.

On 20 December 2023, Asda Propco Limited, a subsidiary of the group, entered into a £400m loan facility
agreement as part of a Corporate Ground Rent transaction. As part of this transaction 55 store properties,
including leases back to Asda Stores Limited as tenant, have been transferred into Asda Propco Limited and a
first floating charge over all property and assets of Asda Propco Limited has been granted to the lenders.

_Derivatives_
Forward contracts - these derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of
forward contracts entered into and are split between in-the-money (assets) and out-of-the-money (liabilities). At
31 December 2023, the Group held £0.5m (2022: £24.0m) in-the-money assets, and £22.3m (2022: £17.3m)
out-of-the-money liabilities in respect of its forward contracts. During the year, the Group recognised net gains
on revaluation of hedged monetary liabilities from historical cost to period-end spot rate of £4.9m (2022: £2.7m
loss). The fair values of the Group’s financial derivatives have been calculated at the observable unquoted
interest rates and are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

Cross-currency interest rate swaps - these derivatives are measured at fair value using a swap valuation model.
The model incorporates various observable market inputs (Level 2) including the credit quality of
counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency basis
spreads between the respective currencies and interest rate curves. The model incorporates a credit valuation
adjustment attributable to derivative counter-party default risk. These derivatives are measured at fair value by
estimating the future settlement rates of cross-currency interest rate swaps entered into and are split between
in-the-money (assets) and out-of-the-money (liabilities). At 31 December 2023, the Group held £nil (2022:
£36.0m assets) in-the-money assets, and £2.9m (2022: £nil) out-of-the-money liabilities in respect of its
cross-currency interest rate swaps.

Interest rate swaps - these derivatives are measured at fair value using a swap valuation model. The model
incorporates various observable market inputs (Level 2) including the credit quality of counterparties and
interest rate curves. The model incorporates a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative counter-party
default risk. These derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of interest rate
swaps entered into and are either in-the-month (assets) or out-of-the-month (liabilities). At 31 December 2023,
the Group held £nil (2022: £nil) in-the-money assets and £6.4m (2022: £nil) out-of-the-money liabilities in
respect of its interest rate swaps.

_Investments- fair value through profit and loss - prior year_
The fair value of the investment in Arthur Foodstores Limited on initial recognition was considered to be the
purchase price. Prior to acquiring the investment in Arthur Foodstores Limited the Directors performed a
valuation exercise using a “market” (or “income”) approach. As the acquisition occurred in close proximity to
31 December 2023 and the Directors were not aware of any material changes to the underlying business, they
were satisfied that the price paid equated to fair value at that date. Further detail is provided in the 2022
financial statements. Control of Arthur Foodstores Limited is deemed to have transferred to the Group on 30
May 2023 and as such, the results of Arthur Foodstores Limited have been consolidated from this date.

**_Financial risk management_**

_Market risks_
In the ordinary course of the Group’s business, it is exposed to a variety of market risks arising in relation to its
financial assets and liabilities, including interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and capital risk. The Group has a
risk management programme in place through which it seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of these market
risks. In addition, the Group hedges interest and exchange rate exposure on foreign currency debt obligations
and hedges interest rate risk on a proportion of its loan facilities with interest rates linked with SONIA. The
Group does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

_Interest rate risk_
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate liabilities (based on SONIA and EURIBOR)
primarily composed of the Senior Facilities, which consist of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A, Term
Loan B and an additional Term Loan entered into during the year. During the year, the Group was exposed to
interest rate risk on the Arthur Additional Bridge Facility, this was settled in full on 23 October 2023. The
EURIBOR interest rate risk on Facility B is hedged through entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps to
fix the interest payments in pound sterling at rates between 3.70% - 3.76% which expired on 16 February 2024.
The SONIA interest rate risk on the Term Loan entered into during the year is hedged through entering into
interest rate swaps to fix a proportion of the interest payments at a fixed interest rate between 4.75% - 4.78%
which expires on 16 November 2025. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes is
charged at fixed rates between 3.25% and 4.50%.

The Group, after the impact of hedge accounting, is exposed to possible changes in SONIA on its outstanding
floating rate loans (Term Loan A and a proportion of the Term Loan entered into during the year). It is
anticipated that a 0.5% increase in the SONIA rate would give rise to an annualised decrease in profit before tax
of £1.8m (2022: £1.2m).

The Group’s Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities were impacted in the prior year by the interest rate
benchmark reform. The Group transitioned these agreements to the new UK risk-free rate benchmark, SONIA,
which was applied to the Group’s interest period starting 1 April 2022.

_Foreign currency risk_

_Forward currency hedging contracts_

The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be
affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are
managed using forward contracts.

The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31
December 2023, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward
currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of future purchases. The terms of the
forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none
exceed a period of more than 18 months after 31 December 2023. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive
income are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.

The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31
December 2023, a net unrealised loss of £12.2m (2022: £36.2m gain) was included in the hedge reserve in
respect of hedging contracts. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect
of these hedging contracts was £15.8m (2022: £7.5m loss) and a gain of £32.6m was reclassified to retained
earnings during the year (see note 26). This consists of a £36.3m loss (2022: £14.4m gain) on not-yet-matured
contracts during the year, £15.3m of loss reclassified to the Income Statement during the year (2022: £23.4m
gains) and a £5.2m taxation credit (2022: £1.5m credit).

Under the Group’s hedging policy, forward currency contracts can be used for both goods for resale and goods
not for resale. The only items for which forward currency contracts are in place as at 31 December 2023 are
forecast purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 100% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses
attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the
Income Statement at the point of sale. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash
flows would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the year,
therefore, amounts recognised in the Income Statement in relation to ineffective forward contract hedges is £nil
(2022: £nil).

At 31 December 2023, the Group held £1,234.4m (2022: £760.2m) of outstanding forward foreign currency
contracts, designated as cash flow hedges. These forward contracts are largely in relation to purchases of US
Dollars (notional $1,470.0m) and Euros (notional €71.4m) with varying maturities up to June 2025. For the
above currencies the rates ranged from USD/GBP from 1.210 to 1.302 (2022: 1.098 to 1.369) and Euro/GBP
1.142 to 1.164 (2022: 1.132 to 1.157).

As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure using forward currency contracts, changes in
exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short-term profitability or cash flow. It is
anticipated that a 5% movement in the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management’s
assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of
£47.2m (2022: £34.6m).

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**21 Financial instruments (continued)**

_Cross-currency swap_
The Group has entered into a floating rate Euro denominated Term Loan B. The non-GBP interest and principal
repayment cash flows from the Euro debt agreement expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates that impact the consolidated Income Statement.

Under the Group’s hedging policy, the Group hedges both the foreign exchange and interest rate risk associated
with a portion of the Group’s existing, Euro foreign-currency denominated debt using EUR-GBP cross currency
interest rate swap contracts to effectively eliminate variability in the Group’s functional currency equivalent
cash flows due to variability in the EUR-GBP exchange rate and the variable interest rate. The hedge ratio is
100% on a current notional basis. The Group has excluded from the cross-currency interest rate swap both the
time value and currency basis elements of the cross-currency interest rate swap. Ineffectiveness could arise from
movements in counterparty credit spread, the non-zero fair value at the hedge designation date due to market
changes that have occurred since the instrument’s inception and changes to critical terms (e.g. reset dates, index
mismatches, payment dates). To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method
and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the change in fair value of the
hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. The amounts recognised in the Income Statement for the period
ended 31 December 2023 relating to ineffectiveness and excluded items was £0.3m (2022: less than £0.1m).

At 31 December 2023, the Group holds cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) with a total nominal value
of €844.5m, designated as cash flow hedges. These swaps result in a fixed GBP interest rate ranging from
3.70% to 3.76% and EUR/GBP rate of 1.1412. On 16 February 2024 - following the expiration of the CCIRSs in
place at the Balance Sheet date - the Group entered into new CCIRSs with an expiration date of 16 February
2025 with the same counterparty banks. This eliminates variability in the Group’s functional currency
equivalent cash flows in relation to Term Loan B for the Group for the 12 month period to 16 February 2025
and fixes the interest rate on Term Loan B at fixed GBP interest rates of between 8.03% and 8.06%.

The CCIRSs were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2023, a net unrealised gain of £3.1m
(2022: £21.2m gain) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net loss recognised in the
cash flow hedge reserve during the year in respect of these swaps was £18.1m (2022: £14.5m gain). This
consists of a £2.6m gain reclassified to the Income Statement during the year (2022: £35.5m gain), a £21.8m
loss (2022: £54.9m gain) on the fair value of the swaps at period end and a taxation credit of £6.3m (2022:
£4.8m charge).

The value of the CCIRSs are sensitive to movements in EURIBOR and EUR/GBP exchange rates. A 0.5%
change in EURIBOR results in a £2.8m (2022: £2.9m) change in value of the CCIRSs and a 5% change in the
EUR/GBP exchange rates results in a £40.2m (2022: £38.9m) change in the value of the CCIRSs. The amounts
charged to the income statement are not sensitive to a change in interest rates but a 5% increase in the FX rate
increases the amount of ineffectiveness by £nil (2022: £nil).

_Interest rate swaps_
The Group has entered into a Term Loan with interest rates calculated based on SONIA. The variable interest
rate exposes the Group to interest rate fluctuations that impact the consolidated Income Statement.

At 31 December 2023, the Group holds interest rate swaps (IRS) with a total nominal value of £540.0m,
designated as cash flow hedges. The hedge ratio is on a 79% current notional basis. These swaps result in a
fixed GBP interest rate ranging from 11.50% to 11.53%.

The IRSs were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2023, a net unrealised loss of £4.8m
(2022: £nil) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net loss recognised in other
comprehensive income during the year in respect of these swaps was £4.8m (2022: £nil). This consists of a
£0.4m gain reclassified to the Income Statement during the year (2022: £nil), a £6.0m loss (2022: £nil) on the
fair value of the swaps at year end and a taxation credit of £1.6m (2022: £nil).


-----

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**21 Financial instruments (continued)**

The value of the IRSs are sensitive to movements in SONIA. A 0.5% change in SONIA results in a £10.9m
(2022: £nil) change in value of the IRSs.

_Credit risk_
The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is included in their carrying value as at the
Balance Sheet date. See note 18 for further information on trade receivables and intercompany receivables and
details of recoverability.

The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default in relation to trade receivables including
detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted.

Surplus cash is placed in both short-term deposits and money market funds with various global financial
institutions. This is managed by the Group Treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to
identify the best terms of deposit in keeping with internal objectives. This includes monitoring the credit rating
of counterparties and investing in accordance with our internal policy. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed
on a monthly basis, and may be updated throughout the financial year. The limits are set to minimise the
concentration of risk and are set taking into account the type of financial asset and the credit rating of the
financial institution.

Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses model under IFRS 9 and
the impact is not material. As such, the provision for expected credit losses is less than £0.1m (2022: less than
£0.1m).

_Liquidity risk_
The Group’s Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring
rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash flows. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity
of funding and flexibility using operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At 31 December 2023, the
RCF and overdraft facilities are unutilised.

_Capital risk management_

The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure may not be sufficient to support the growth of its
business and maintain its existing credit rating. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt obligations
(including the Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes, Term Loans and the Senior Unsecured Notes) and
equity (issued share capital, share premium and reserves).

**23 Employee costs and benefits (continued)**

Historically, ASDA Stores Limited (“ASDA Stores”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, has provided
retirement benefits for eligible employees through two defined benefit plans in the UK, one funded, the ASDA
Group Pension Scheme (“AGPS”) and one unfunded, the Unapproved Unfunded Retirement Benefit Scheme
("UURBS”).

On 9 July 2021, the Trustees of AGPS completed a full buy-out of this scheme with a third party insurer. The
buy-out extinguished ASDA Stores’ responsibility for funding the AGPS as sponsoring employer and as such,
all assets and liabilities of the AGPS were de-recognised from the Group consolidated balance sheet during the
2021 financial year other than a small proportion of liabilities which have been settled in full during the year and
have a carrying value at 31 December 2023 of £nil (2022 carrying value: £0.5m).

ASDA Stores remains the sponsoring employer of the UURBS and as such, liabilities relating to future pension
payments to UURBS members are accounted for as employee benefit liabilities in the Group balance sheet.

**Defined benefit pension schemes**

_Background to the AGPS buy-in and buy-out_
For further detail, please refer to the Group's financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022.

_Amounts recognised in the consolidated Income Statement_
Interest expense of £0.4m (2022: £0.3m) has been recognised during the year in relation to the unwind of
discount on the liabilities of the UURBS.

_Amounts recognised in Other Comprehensive Income_
Pre-tax net losses of £0.1m (2022: net gains of £5.5m) have been recognised during the year in relation to
actuarial movements on the liabilities of the UURBS.

**Share-based payments**

Share-based payment transactions are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payments’.

The total expenses recognised for the year arising from share-based payments are as follows:

**December** **December**
**2023** **2022**
**£ m** **£ m**

Equity-settled share-based payment charge

_Management Incentive Plan_
During the prior year, management shares in the immediate parent company of the Group were issued to eligible
members of senior management employed by the Group as part of a Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) in
exchange for proceeds determined by an independently determined fair value calculated at the issue date. Under
the MIP, an intermediate holding company of the Group - Bellis Midco 2 Limited - has entered into an
agreement with the holders of MIP management shares (“MIP scheme members”) whereby MIP scheme
members are granted put options which, when exercised, enable them to sell their management shares to Bellis
Midco 2 Limited or another non-Group entity for a value which is based on an independent valuation
determined at the exercise date.

MIP scheme members are required to be employed by the Group at the grant date of the MIP shares. If a
member of the scheme ceases to be employed by the Group during the vesting period, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, a
parent of Bellis Finco PLC, has the option to repurchase, or nominate another entity of the Group to repurchase,
the shares during the 12 month period after the member’s leave date. As such, the Directors have determined
that the MIP scheme falls within the scope of IFRS 2.

The difference between the IFRS 2 fair value and the fair value paid by MIP scheme members at the grant date
is expensed over the vesting period (i.e. the period from the date on which the MIP shares are granted to the
estimated exercise date) as an expense in the consolidated Income Statement.

As neither MIP shares nor put options over MIP shares are issued by entities within the Group, and as there is
no recharge agreement in place which requires any entity within the Group to settle liabilities in respect of MIP
shares, changes in the fair value of MIP shares are accounted for on an equity-settled basis.

The fair value of the options outstanding under the MIP scheme at 31 December 2023 is £4.2m (2022: £4.8m).

An amount of £0.9m (2022: £0.7m) has been accounted for as an equity-settled share based payments expense
in respect of the MIP in accordance with the proportion of the vesting period which has elapsed during the year.

Current liabilities

Non-current liabilities

The insurance provision above relates to claims liabilities arising from past events such as accidents in our
depots and stores which are not covered by third party insurance. The value of the provision is established using
independent actuarial assessments or a reasonable estimate based on past experience. These provisions are
expected to crystallise within 5 years. Insurance liabilities are not discounted as the impact would not be
material.

Where the Group settles insurance claims for which it has recourse to a third-party insurer, the amount due from
the insurer is included within trade and other receivables. The carrying value of these amounts at 31 December
2023 is £nil (2022: £nil).

The dilapidation provision represents provisions for the cost of works required to remove leasehold
improvements within leasehold properties at the end of their lease term. The amount of the provision recognised
is adjusted based on the length of the lease remaining to reflect the uncertainty in the value of the provision
where a lease has a substantial remaining term (greater than 35 years). The amount provided during the year is
accounted for as an increase or decrease in the cost of property, plant and equipment and the impact of this will
be recognised as depreciation over the lease terms of the sites to which the provision relates. The increase in the
year is due primarily to additions relating to the sale & leaseback transaction (see note 10), and liabilities
acquired during the year relating to the leasehold property of Arthur Foodstores Limited and subsidiaries of
Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited.

A discount rate of 4.2% (2022: 4.0%) has been used in determining this provision. The provision will be utilised
at the end of the respective terms of the leases giving rise to these liabilities.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to

The share premium account is used to record amounts received in excess of the nominal value of shares on issue
of new shares.

Included in the number of shares issued were 50,000 shares issued at par for a nominal value of £0.1m and an
additional share issued at a premium for a value of £1,280.0m.

**26 Reserves**

_Cash flow hedge reserve_
The cash flow hedge reserve of £(13.9)m (2022: £57.4m) represents the gains and losses arising on revaluation
of derivatives, being forward currency contracts, cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.

_Retained earnings_
The retained earnings balance of £2,658.8m (2022 restated: £2,430.8m) represents the brought forward retained
earnings, £194.5m profit during the year and £0.9m share-based payment charges relating to the equity-settled
MIP scheme (see note 23).

During the year, gains of £32.6m previously reclassified in the cash flow hedge reserve were reclassified to
retained earnings. This amount relates to forward contract derivatives which were in place on 16 February 2021

- the date that the group acquired the entire issued share capital of ASDA Group Limited (“the acquisition
date”). At the acquisition date, forward contracts entered into by ASDA Group Limited prior to that date were
out of the money with a post-tax unrealised loss of £32.6m recognised as a net liability within the carrying value
of net assets acquired by the Group on that date. This had the impact of reducing the bargain purchase gain
recognised on the acquisition within the 2021 Income Statement (see 2021 financial statements for further
detail). During the period between the acquisition date and 31 December 2021, realised losses on these contracts
were recognised within cost of goods sold and tax expense with a corresponding gain recognised in the cash
flow hedge reserve but as the unrealised losses were also recognised as a charge within the gain on bargain
purchase, this resulted in an overstatement of the cash flow hedge reserve of £32.6m and a corresponding
understatement of retained earnings of £32.6m at 31 December 2021. This has been corrected by transferring the
amount from the cash flow hedge reserve to retained earnings in 2023 with no impact on total equity
shareholders’ funds at 31 December 2023 or 31 December 2022, no impact on profit for the current or prior
year, and no impact on net assets at 31 December 2023 or 31 December 2022.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)

**28 Commitments**

**Capital commitments**
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had entered into contracts of £22.8m (2022: £14.3m) to purchase property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets.

**Other financial commitments**
As at 31 December 2023, the Group had entered into contracts to purchase US Dollars for £1,174.6m (2022:
£742.9m) and energy for £243.7m (2022: £254.5m).

**29 Contingent liabilities**

_Equal Value Claims_
ASDA Stores Limited ("ASDA"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, has been served with circa 53,000
employment tribunal claims (and notified of an additional 6,410 High Court claims that have not been served
and are stayed pending the outcome of the employment tribal claims). The claims have been presented on behalf
of current and former ASDA store employees, who allege that their work in ASDA's stores is of equal value in
terms of the demands of their jobs to that of employees working in ASDA's distribution centres, and that the
differences in pay and terms and conditions between the different jobs are not objectively justified. The
claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the distribution centres and those
higher wage rates and more favourable terms and conditions on a prospective basis as part of these equal value
proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be served.

At present, the Directors cannot predict the number of claims that may be served, and cannot reasonably
estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings.

There are three stages to these proceedings:

- Comparability - on 26 March 2021, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision that the work of
hourly-paid workers in distribution centres and the work of hourly-paid workers in stores can be compared.

- Equal Value - this stage is a legal process to determine whether any of the claimants’ roles are of equal value
to any of the comparator roles. A court hearing on this stage of the proceedings is scheduled to commence on 9
September 2024.

- Material Factor Defence - if it is established that any roles are of equal value, there will be a further legal
process to determine whether there are objective, non-discriminatory reasons for these differentials in pay and
other terms.

At the balance sheet date and the date of approval of the accounts, the proceedings are at the Equal Value stage.

The Directors believe that there are substantial factual and legal defences to these claims and intend to defend
the claims vigorously. No provision continues to be recognised on the basis that any potential liability is only a
possible obligation, as it has yet to be confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an
outflow of resources embodying economic benefits.

Following the acquisition by the Group of the entire issued share capital of ASDA Group Limited (the
immediate parent of ASDA Stores Limited) on 16 February 2021, the Group has entered into an indemnification
agreement which is guaranteed by a wholly owned subsidiary of the former ultimate parent of ASDA Stores
Limited, Walmart Inc. ("Walmart") with respect to these claims. Walmart has indemnified the Group for these
claims up to a contractually agreed amount.

In addition to the above, the Group paid consideration of £2,000.1m to EG Finco Limited to acquire Euro
Garages (Jersey) Limited. At the same time, the Group entered into a Transitional Services Agreement ("TSA")
with consideration allocated to this transaction of £27.3m. Furthermore, the Group also entered into an
integration support agreement for a fixed amount of £11.3m payable over 2 years. Further to this, the Group has
estimated deferred consideration of £25.3m which is included in trade and other payables. Please see further
detail of these balances in note 2.

Up to 31 October 2023, transactions between the Group and Euro Garages Limited and Leon Grocery Limited
are disclosed as related party transactions. The results of both entities have been consolidated from 31 October
2023 so are eliminated within the Group consolidated results from that date.

At 31 December 2022, an amount of £41.0m (see note 21) was payable to Arthur Foodstores Limited ("Arthur").
Prior to consolidation of Arthur's results from 30 May 2023, the amount was reduced by £8.8m following the
finalisation of completion accounts (see note 2 for further detail). The remaining outstanding payable has been
eliminated in the consolidated results of the Group from 30 May 2023.

At 31 December 2022, an amount of £26.6m due from Arthur Foodstores Limited was presented in loans
receivable (see note 18). This included a balance of £23.6m arising out of cash lent to Arthur Foodstores
Limited, largely in order to enable that entity to satisfy short-term working capital requirements; and a further
balance of £3.0m which was transferred to the Group on 29 October 2022. In March 2023, Arthur repaid an
amount of £18.0m plus interest of £0.5m. The remaining outstanding receivable has been eliminated in the
consolidated results of the Group from 30 May 2023.

Further to these amounts, the Group purchased electricity on Arthur Foodstores Limited’s behalf amounting to
£0.8m which was recharged at cost prior to 30 May 2023. Any recharges to Arthur Foodstores Limited since
that date have been eliminated on consolidation.

# Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC
## Opinion

#### In our opinion:

 • Bellis Finco plc’s group financial statements and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2022 and of the group’s loss for the year then ended;

 • the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK adopted international accounting standards;

 • the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

 • the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

 We have audited the financial statements of Bellis Finco plc (the ‘parent company’) and its subsidiaries (the ‘group’) for the year ended 31 December 2022 which comprise:

**Group** **Parent company**

**Consolidated balance sheet as at 31 December 2022** Balance sheet as at 31 December 2022

**Consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then**
**ended**

**Related notes 1 to 29 to the financial statements,**
**including a summary of significant accounting policies**


Related notes 1 to 11 to the financial
statements including a summary of
significant accounting policies


#### The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and UK adopted international accounting standards. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). 

## Basis for opinion

#### We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our


-----

#### audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements.

 We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

## Conclusions relating to going concern

#### In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included: 

 • Determining whether in our judgement the process applied by management in making their assessment of going concern, including supporting cash flow forecasts to 30 June 2024 and covenant compliance calculations, was fit for purpose.

 • Assessing key assumptions used both in the base case and in the severe but plausible downside scenario forecasts by reference to historical data and external market perspectives.

 • Assessing whether we considered the downside sensitivities to be appropriately severe in the current retail grocery market;

 • Corroborating key assumptions in the group forecasts (e.g. market share, product price, mix and volume, cost inflation and finance costs) to other evidence including external research, historical performance and internal sector specialists, and ensuring this was consistent with our audit work in other areas;

 • Testing the mathematical accuracy of management’s cash flow models;

 • Reperforming the group’s covenant compliance test calculations to determine if the covenant tests apply in the base case or downside scenarios;

 • For the strategic growth option modelled by management, performing the same procedures as outlined above for the related base case and downside scenarios plus a further assessment of the related financing structure and terms required to provide sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom;

 • Assessing the Directors’ and Shareholders’ commitment through a Board resolution to only progress the most advanced strategic option if the terms of the funding were within prescribed boundaries that would not cause a breach of facilities under the various scenarios modelled; and

 • Reviewing the disclosures in the financial statements relating to the going concern basis of preparation and evaluating that these provided an explanation of the Directors’ assessment that was consistent with the audit evidence we obtained.

 As part of the governance processes documented by the Board, there is a commitment to only progress the most advanced strategic option with funding arrangements that will secure adequate liquidity and covenant headroom through the going concern review period. 

 Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period to 30 June 2024. Going concern has also been determined to be a key audit matter.


-----

#### Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

## Overview of our audit approach

**Audit scope** - We performed an audit of the complete financial information of three
components.

            - The components where we performed full audit procedures accounted for 100%
of adjusted EBITDA, 100% of revenue and 100% of total assets.


**Key audit**
**matters**



- Going concern

- Supplier income


**Materiality** - Overall group materiality of £25m which represents 2.3% of adjusted EBITDA

## An overview of the scope of the parent company and group audits

### Tailoring the scope

#### Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality determine our audit scope for each company within the group. Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group wide controls, changes in the business environment, and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each company.

 In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the three reporting components of the group, we selected all components covering entities in the UK, which represent the principal business units within the group.

 Of the three components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of all components (“full scope components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.

 The three full scope reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2021:100%) of the group’s adjusted EBITDA, 100% (2021: 100%) of the group’s revenue and 100% (2021: 100%) of the group’s total assets. Our scoping is consistent with the prior year.

### Involvement with component teams 

#### All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the group audit team.

## Climate change

#### Stakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact Bellis Finco plc. The group has determined that the most significant future impacts from climate change will be physical risk and the impact it could have on operations, property and supply chain. This is disclosed as part of


-----

#### the principal risks and uncertainties on page 44 which form part of the “Other information,” rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on “Other information”. 

 In planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the group’s business and any consequential material impact on its financial statements. 

 The group has explained in in the Basis of Preparation their consideration of climate change and its impact on their financial statements. These disclosures also explain where governmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, and where the degree of certainty of these changes means that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset valuations and the timing of future cashflows under UK adopted international accounting standards. 

 Our audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating management’s assessment of the impact of climate risk have been reflected in the valuation of long-lived assets. 

 We also challenged the Directors’ considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and associated disclosures. 

 Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to impact a key audit matter. 

## Key audit matters

#### Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters include those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.


-----

**Risk** **Our response to the risk** **Key observations communicated**
**to the Audit Committee**


We did not identify any evidence
of material misstatement in
relation to the recognition of
supplier income.


**Supplier Income**

**_Refer to Accounting policies_**
**_(pages 96-97)_**

**Total supplier income recognised**
**in the year is in the form of**
**volume agreements and fixed**
**agreements. We consider fixed**
**agreements to have a higher**
**degree of subjectivity as they are**
**manual in nature and can be**
**retrospective, compared to the**
**volume agreements which are**
**agreed up front and largely**
**automated, and therefore our**
**risk procedures are focused on**
**these types of agreements.**

**There is a risk of inappropriate**
**cut-off around early or late**
**funding, or false recognition of**
**supplier income due back from**
**suppliers.**


We performed full scope audit
procedures over this risk area on
one component which covered
100% of the total amount.

We performed the following
procedures:

- We reviewed and challenged
the appropriateness of the
group’s supplier income
accounting policies

- We performed walkthroughs
of the supplier income process
and identified and tested the
operating effectiveness of key
controls within the process

- We tested and relied on
management’s IT general
controls across the supplier
income IT application

- We used data analytics to
perform analytic procedures
across the entire population of
both fixed and volume
agreements to identify unusual
trends, material supplier
agreements, and potential late
adjustments. We then tested
these outliers through to
underlying agreements and
validated that the accounting
was correct and that the
agreements had been
appropriately approved in line
with policy

- We analysed the margin across
different operating
departments to identify any
unusual changes. We sought
explanations for these
movements and corroborated
to external support where
possible (i.e. to macroeconomic conditions)

- We held meetings with buyers
across key departments to
understand significant
agreements and the impact
they had on the overall


-----

performance of that
department

                 - We performed a correlation
analysis to confirm that the
flow of transactions through
the income statement and
balance sheet is complete and
accurately recorded

                 - We obtained confirmations
from a sample of material
vendors to confirm key terms
back to signed agreements

                 - Certain supplier agreements
have the right to be offset
against accounts payable. We
substantively tested that where
balances had been offset, that
right existed within the
agreement and was therefore
appropriate.

                 - We tested material funding
received post year end to
ensure it was accounted for in
the correct period.

#### In the prior year, our auditor’s report also included two additional key audit matters in relation to Purchase Price Allocation and Sale and Leaseback. In the current year, these are no longer key audit matters as these transactions were specific to the prior year.

## Our application of materiality

#### We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. 

### Materiality

#### The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.

 We determined materiality for the group to be £25 million (2021: £34 million), which is 2.3% of adjusted EBITDA (2021: 5% of adjusted EBIT). We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides us with an appropriate basis for materiality and is the most relevant measure for stakeholders. The adjusted EBITDA has been adjusted to add back the separation costs related to the IT transformation project of £188.7m which we consider to be non-recurring and we have excluded the receipt of the indemnification income of £49.3m which we also consider to be non-recurring. In the prior year, we used adjusted EBIT as the basis for materiality. In the current year, adjusted EBITDA has been established as the key performance indicator that is used with external and internal stakeholders.


-----

#### We determined materiality for the parent company to be £25 million (2021: £27 million) which is 1.8% of equity (2021: 2% of equity). 

 During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and no change from our original assessment at planning was required.

### Performance materiality

#### The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality.

 On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2021: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £19m (2021: £25m). We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to there being limited factors present that indicate a higher likelihood that misstatements may occur.

 Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.  In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £5m to £19m (2021: £5m to £25m). 

### Reporting threshold
#### An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.

 We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £1m (2021: £2m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

 We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

## Other information

#### The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 4-58, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. 

 Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

 Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact.

 We have nothing to report in this regard.


-----

## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006

#### In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

 • the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
 • the strategic report and directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

## Matters on which we are required to report by exception

#### In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.

 We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:

 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

 • the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

 • certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit

## Responsibilities of directors

#### As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 59, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. 

 In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

## Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements

#### Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

#### Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud

 Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management. 

 • We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK adopted International Accounting Standards for the group and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice for the parent) and the relevant tax laws and regulations in the UK. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements being those laws and regulations relating to health and safety and employee matters.

 • We understood how Bellis Finco plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of group management, group Legal & Compliance, and Internal Audit. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers and inspection of commentary in the group management accounts, and understanding the processes and controls they had in place to monitor compliance, as well as observations in Audit Committee meetings and consideration of the results of our audit procedures across the group.

 • We assessed the susceptibility of the group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was a susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from material fraud and error.

 • Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations, including where necessary forensics specialists. Our procedures involved journal entry testing on the full population of journals, with a focus on manual consolidation journals, and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of group management, group Legal, group Ethics & Compliance, and Internal Audit. In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in the group Financial Statements with the requirements of the relevant accounting standards, and UK legislation.

 A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

The Group is currently working to identify the physical risk to our business and supply chains from the
changing climate, along with the potential impact of policy, technology and market changes as we transition to a
lower carbon future. This is a developing area with inherent uncertainty which is constantly evolving. The work
being undertaken will be embedded in our risk management framework to help inform our overall response to
the risks and opportunities that are identified. Our assessment to date has not identified material expenditure
arising out of the impact of climate-related risk and this is reflected in the financial forecasts used to assess the
going concern basis and to determine the recoverable amount of long-lived assets. Management will continue to
monitor this in future periods.

**Going concern**
The financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2022 have been prepared on the going concern basis
as the Directors have determined that the Group has sufficient resources and liquidity facilities to meet its
liabilities as they fall due for the period from the date of approval of the accounts to 30 June 2024 (‘the going
concern period’).

In assessing the Group’s ability to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have reviewed the Group's
annual corporate planning process which includes profitability, cashflow and liquidity forecasting and have
based their projections for the going concern period on the FY23 plan and the FY24 forecasts from the
three-year planning process.

The Group’s Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring
rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash flows and maintaining a sufficient level of standby facilities via the
Revolving Credit Facility. Any capital repayments of long-term financing are forecast in the cash flow model
used in the going concern scenarios. The Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn at the year end and no
utilisation is forecast in the base case cash flow model. For more information on liquidity risk and maturity of
financial liabilities see note 19.

In assessing the Group’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have tested the
ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due from the date of approval of the accounts to 30 June
2024, in the event of various cash flow scenarios, including a severe but plausible downside scenario. This
scenario applies severe but plausible economic downsides to our base case forecast, modelling the impact of a
decline of the Group’s participation in the UK grocery market compared to planned growth alongside the risk of
fuel margin decline, inflationary pressures and risk of not achieving forecast levels of cost transformation
activities. Furthermore, the Directors have considered the likely impacts on the business of levels of
geo-political instability and uncertainty arising out of external events which are ongoing at the date of approval
of the financial statements. The Directors are satisfied that the potential economic impacts of these events are
adequately taken into account in the severe but plausible downside scenario.

Mitigating actions that are in the control of management have been considered such as reducing non-essential
capital expenditure and discretionary spend. These mitigating actions are not required to be implemented to
ensure sufficient headroom in the severe but plausible downside scenario.

In the severe but plausible downside scenario the maximum utilisation of the RCF is 4%. Where management
do not implement any mitigating actions the maximum utilisation of the RCF is 31%. The Directors consider
that a scenario with no mitigating actions is not realistic as all modelled mitigating actions are readily
accessible.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

The Group is subject to a maintenance covenant whereby the senior secured net leverage ratio cannot exceed
4.90:1. This covenant is required to be tested if, as at the quarter end, drawings on the RCF exceed 40% of the
facility. The Directors have also considered whether the above scenarios trigger the requirement to test the
Group’s financial covenant and have confirmed that there would be no requirement to test financial covenants
under the cashflow scenarios modelled during the going concern period.

The model has been reverse stress tested to determine the level of sales and margin decline that would lead to
the Group breaching the level of available facilities or covenants. The Directors consider that the likelihood of
such a significant deterioration of cash flows or profitability is remote.

Furthermore, the Directors have considered the potential impact of strategic options which would further
accelerate the Group’s ability to achieve its growth ambitions. These include, but are not limited to, investments
to enable organic growth as well as significant potential acquisition opportunities, some of which may require
additional capital and funding required to execute these opportunities.
Whilst no options have reached the commitment stage, the impact of the most advanced of these options,
including incremental capital and funding requirements, has been modelled based on the Directors’ best estimate
of the assumptions required for the initial investment, terms of financing and post-acquisition trading. In
addition to undertaking normal diligence processes before committing to such a strategic option, and in
accordance with the Group’s established governance framework as outlined on pages 23-30 of the Strategic
Report, the Boards of the controlling parent (Bellis Topco 2 Limited) and of the Company have approved a
resolution that sets out the required financial and associated criteria that must apply for the most advanced
strategic option to be executed in the going concern review period. Such criteria include, inter alia, not
progressing until appropriate financing is in place within specified cost parameters which ensure both
affordability and the ability of the Group to continue to meet its liabilities and covenant requirements in the
going concern period.

For the most advanced strategic option, the Group has modelled a potential severe but plausible downside
scenario of the combined Group, which includes, where relevant, sensitivities of the post-acquisition trading and
any assumed synergies. In such scenarios, the Group maintains sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom in
the going concern period, having applied mitigations under the control of management where necessary.

Whilst the most advanced strategic option (and any related finance) are not committed to, as of the date of
approval of the financial statements, the Directors consider that the governance processes outlined in this note
will ensure that if the modelled strategic option were committed to, that this would not impact the ability of the
Group to meet its liabilities for the going concern period to 30 June 2024.

Thus, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis without any material
uncertainties.

**Changes in accounting policy**
None of the standards, interpretations and amendments effective for the first time from 1 January 2022 have had
a material impact on the financial statements.

**New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective**
There are no issued but not yet effective standards, interpretations and amendments, which have not been
applied in these financial statements, that will or may have a material impact on the Group financial statements
in future.

**Judgements, estimates and assumptions**
Management are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies
and reported assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually
evaluated and are based on historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The key judgements, estimates and assumptions impacting the carrying value of assets and liabilities are
discussed further below.

_Judgements_

_Business combinations - acquisition date relating to the Group's purchase of the share capital of Arthur_
_Foodstores Limited (current year)_

On 29 October 2022, Asda Stores Limited - a wholly owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco plc - purchased 100% of
the share capital of Arthur Foodstores Limited, a grocery retailer operating in the United Kingdom for an initial
purchase price of £461.8m. This comprises initial cash consideration of £423.6m, of which £228.6m has been
funded from cash in hand and £195.0m has been raised through the issue of additional senior facilities of
£200.0m, less bank fees of £5.0m; and a balance owed to Arthur Foodstores Limited of £38.2m. Prior to
completion of the acquisition, the seller owed a balance of £38.2m to Arthur Foodstores Limited. This liability
was novated to the Group on completion at 29 October 2022 as part of the Sale and Purchase Agreement.

On 26 October 2022 the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order
(“IEO”) under section 72 (2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Asda Stores Limited; Asda Group Limited; Mr
Mohsin Issa; Mr Zuber Issa; TDR Capital LLP; TDR Capital III Portfolio No. 2 L.P.; TDR Capital III
Investments (2019) L.P.; Co-operative Group Limited and Arthur Foodstores Limited. The IEO commenced on
30 October 2022. The IEO requires the Group to effectively ‘hold separate’ the Arthur business, an independent
management team has been appointed to run the Arthur business during the IEO period and the parties are
prohibited from performing any integration activities or exchanging of commercially sensitive information.

As at 31 December 2022, as a result of the IEO restrictions, the Group has concluded that it does not have
control of Arthur Foodstores Limited and therefore the results of the business are not consolidated in these
financial statements. The Group expects to obtain control over Arthur Foodstores Limited from the date that the
IEO is lifted, unless there are significant derogations from the CMA entered into before this date which provide
evidence of the Group obtaining control. From the date control is obtained, Arthur Foodstores Limited will be
consolidated into the Group accounts.

_Business combinations - acquisition date relating to the Group's acquisition of ASDA Group Limited (prior_
_period)_

On 16 February 2021, Mohsin and Zuber Issa, founders and co-CEOs of EG Group, a global convenience and
forecourts retailer, headquartered in Blackburn, UK, and investment funds managed by TDR Capital LLP
(“TDR Capital”), a leading UK-based private equity firm, together acquired ASDA Group Limited (“ASDA”).

Under the new ownership structure, Mohsin and Zuber Issa and TDR Capital indirectly own 100% of the
ordinary shares in Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited (“BAC3”) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, which in turn acquired the entire issued share capital of ASDA.

On 10 February 2021, the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order
(IEO) under section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Zuber Issa, Mohsin Issa, TDR Capital LLP and ASDA
in relation to the acquisition by BAC3 of ASDA. The IEO commenced on 16 February 2021, the day transaction
legally completed and was lifted on 16 June 2021.

In determining the acquisition date, for the purposes of applying IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the Directors
considered whether the IEO restrictions prevented BAC3 from controlling ASDA. In making this judgement the
Directors considered BAC3’s ability to direct the relevant activities of ASDA that could impact its return during
the IEO period. The Directors concluded that control transferred on 16 February 2021, as there was sufficient
evidence of BAC3’s ability to direct ASDA from this date. The IEO was subsequently lifted on 16 June 2021.
As a result, ASDA Group Limited and its subsidiaries have been consolidated in these financial statements since
16 February 2021.
_IFRS 16 lease term_
IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the period covered by
options to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option, and the period covered by an
option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise the option. The Group applies
judgement to whether an extension should be added to the non-cancellable lease term with reference to the
following:

- Extension options in the contract. Consideration as to whether any option is reasonably certain to be
exercised is based on whether an economic incentive exists to do so. This incentive is assessed by reference
to multiple factors including but not limited to current operational performance of the site and future
performance projections, length of time to the option exercise date and future capital requirements. The
majority of the Group's leases do not have extension options in the contract but, where they do, most lease
terms include the extension period.

- Geographical factors. A term extension on any lease for sites in England and Wales may be judged
reasonably certain on the basis of security of tenure if an economic incentive to remain in the lease beyond
the contractual term is deemed to exist. This incentive is assessed by reference to the same factors listed
above. If an extension is judged reasonably certain, the typical additional term applied is 10 years.
Geographical factors are not considered for sites outside England and Wales.

In the event of changing circumstances or new information that may impact judgements taken, lease terms will
be re-assessed on a lease by lease basis. Term reassessments are identified on an ad-hoc basis in light of new or
updated information which would impact the assumptions originally recognised. Any change in lease term could
result in a recalculation of the lease liability and a material adjustment to the associated right-of-use asset. There
are no examples of term reassessment in 2022.

_IFRS 16 discount rate_

IFRS 16 requires that lease liabilities are discounted at the interest rate implicit in a lease, or where this isn’t
available, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The majority of the Group’s leases do not include an interest
rate implicit in the lease, and therefore the incremental borrowing rate is utilised to discount these leases.

The incremental borrowing rate is considered a key judgement and under IFRS 16 reflects the rate of interest a
lessee would incur to borrow over a similar term, with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of
a similar value in a similar economic environment.

We consider the following factors in determining the incremental borrowing rate:

- The risk free rate of return in the UK market; and,

- The credit risk spread which reflects the additional risks associated with lending specifically to the Group,
taking account of factors such as our credit rating, the term of the lease, and the geographic location.

The risk free rate is observable in the market and is the base of our calculation, however there is significant
judgement in determining the additional credit risk spread specific to the Group on the basis that there is limited
market observable data on which to make this judgement, particularly for lease terms in excess of 10 years. As a
result we utilise rates from other geographical regions (e.g. US) for companies with a similar credit rating where
there is more market observable data on which to base our judgement. The geographical locations utilised,
alongside the specific data selected for inclusion are considered a key judgement.

Due to the extent of the Group’s lease portfolio, small changes in discount rate can significantly impact the
accounting recognition and could result in a material difference to the right-of-use asset, lease liability, and
associated depreciation and interest charge recognised in the Income Statement.

Further, the Group has leases for a wide range of different terms, from 1 year to in excess of 100 years.
Judgement is used by the Group to apply a cap of 30 years to the discount rate on the basis that data relating to
loans for terms in excess of 30 years is rare and as such, no more reliable rate than a 30 year rate can be
determined.

The Group also applies judgement in determining the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis.
Management have asserted that by updating the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis, we ensure that
the discount rate used remains relevant, current and materially correct. Should events and conditions change in
the interim period we would consider whether the discount rate should be updated on a more frequent basis.

_Supply Chain Finance_

Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be
classified as trade payables or as another line item on the Balance Sheet. In determining the classification, the
Group reviews each arrangement against a number of characteristics to assess whether the substance of
liabilities owed by the Group to the participating banks under the contractual terms of the arrangements is
consistent with other trade payables. These include:

- Whether participation in the schemes is voluntary for suppliers;

- Whether the Group is involved in the negotiations and agreements between the banks and suppliers or
tri-partite agreements exist;

- Whether payment terms have been extended outside industry norms for trade payables;

- Whether interest is accrued on outstanding balances or fees are receivable by the Group;

- Whether the banks require parent guarantees in respect of the Group’s obligations;

- Whether the Group retains its rights to offset credits or withhold payment.

The nature of the Group’s liabilities under supply chain financing arrangements when considering these
characteristics supports classification of amounts owed by the Group under its supply chain financing
arrangements as trade payables.

_Litigation_

Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance
with IAS 37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters
are made in relation to contingent liabilities (note 27).

_Estimates_
_Deferred gain relating to sale-and-leaseback transaction_
The Group estimates the gain on sale to be recognised in the Income Statement based on the amount of the gain
that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The remaining gain is deferred as a reduction to the
right-of-use asset relating to the leaseback. This estimate requires determining the fair value of the properties
transferred and calculating the lease liability of the leaseback. As noted in the ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’ section
above, there is inherent judgement included in the determination of the appropriate discount rate. The fair value
of properties transferred is determined using third party valuation specialists. Please see further detail on
financial amounts in the prior period in note 9.

**Basis of consolidation**
The consolidated financial statements combine the financial statements of Bellis Finco PLC and all its
subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are entities over which Bellis Finco PLC has control. The Group has control over
another entity when the Group has all of the following:
(a) power over the investee, for example through voting or other rights;
(b) exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
(c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the Group's returns.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement from
the date that control is established or up to the date at which control is lost, as appropriate. Where necessary,
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with
those used by the Group.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its
subsidiaries, which are related parties, are eliminated in full.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Business combinations and goodwill**
Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition
date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of
non-controlling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets
is determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in
operating costs. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for
appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the
consideration transferred and any amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the fair value of
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the
contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities
representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably.

If the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and any amount recognised for
the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the
difference represents a gain on bargain purchase (negative goodwill) and is recognised in the Consolidated
Income Statement as other income.

The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured at acquisition date fair
value in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ with the exception of income taxes, employee
benefits, reimbursement assets, reacquired rights, share-based payments and assets held-for-sale.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to
each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of
whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit, or group of units, to
which goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored
for internal management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the
goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when
determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured
based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

**Foreign currency**
The presentational currency of the Group is Sterling. The primary functional currency of the parent and
subsidiary companies is also Sterling.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement,
except when hedge accounting is applied and differences are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the spot rate ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate
approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.

Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive
income. They are released into the Consolidated Income Statement upon disposal.

**Non-underlying items presented in the consolidated Income Statement**
In order to provide stakeholders with additional insight into the year on year performance of the Group, and to
align presentation more closely with how financial performance is monitored internally by the Executive
Committee and the Board of Directors, items in the consolidated Income Statement are shown on a basis which
excludes the impact of non-underlying items alongside the reported IFRS numbers. The presentation of prior
period comparatives has been restated to the same basis as current year amounts to ensure consistency in the
reporting periods presented in the current year consolidated Income Statement.

Determining which items are to be presented as non-underlying items requires judgement and is based on an
assessment of the size and nature of Income Statement amounts. This includes identifying material amounts
which do not arise in the normal course of business, or are non-recurring, and are individually significant
enough to impact a reader's assessment of the Group's financial performance. Profit excluding non-underlying
items is not an IFRS measure and as such is not directly comparable to other companies.

Further detail of amounts classified as non-underlying items in the current year and prior period is provided in
note 4.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired are carried initially at cost. Following initial recognition, the historic cost model is
applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses.

Intangible assets include software costs. Software costs capitalised consist of both costs from third parties and
costs of internal resources involved in development activities. When considering whether software costs can be
capitalised, the Directors perform an assessment of whether the Group controls the underlying asset. Factors
considered when assessing whether the Group controls an asset include where and how the software is hosted
and the ability the Group has to make changes to the software.

Costs are only capitalised once a project is in the development stage and approval for the project as a whole to
be completed has been obtained. Costs incurred in the research stage are expensed as incurred.

Integration costs between different software is capitalised where it can be demonstrated that these are separate
intangible assets and control is evident.

In relation to Software as a Service (“SAAS”) contracts, where it cannot be demonstrated that the Group
controls the underlying assets' development, costs incurred are immediately recognised as an expense in the
Consolidated Income Statement other than software licence fees which are included in prepaid expenses and
amortised over the period of the respective licence. The factors noted above in relation to how the software is
hosted and whether the Group has the ability to make or direct changes directly to the underlying software as
part of the SAAS contract are considered as part of this assessment.

Where implementation costs are incurred as part of a SAAS contract, these implementation costs are separately
considered to identify whether they represent an intangible asset in their own right as detailed above. If the
Directors conclude that the implementation costs do not meet the recognition criteria of a separate intangible
asset, an assessment is then made as to whether the costs represent configuration of the software product or
customisation. If configuration, these costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred,
whereas if customisation the Directors will assess whether these should be recognised over the term of the
SAAS contract if they are not distinct from the underlying software product itself. Purchases of new hardware
are capitalised as Property, Plant and Equipment and so would not be included in intangibles.

Costs associated with interim software solutions which do not meet the Group’s policy of a 3 year minimum
useful economic life are expensed as incurred.

Brand licences are capitalised when acquired as part of a business combination if they are separable or arise
from contractual or other legal rights. A brand licence is initially measured at fair value using an appropriate
valuation methodology (e.g. relief-from-royalty approach). Brand licences are not amortised where they have an
indefinite useful life. Costs in relation to internally generated brands are not capitalised.

Customer relationships are capitalised when acquired as part of a business combination if they are separable or
arise from contractual or other legal rights. A customer relationship is initially measured at fair value using an
appropriate valuation methodology (e.g. multi-period excess earnings method). Customer relationships are
amortised over their useful economic life of 10 years.

**Amortisation**
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their
expected useful lives, with charges included in operating costs, as follows:

Software and development costs 4 years
Customer contractual relationships 10 years

The purchased goodwill of the Group and brand licence intangibles are regarded as having an indefinite useful
economic life and in accordance with IAS 38, are not amortised but are subject to annual tests for impairment.

**Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Items of property, plant and equipment under construction are valued at cost and not depreciated. Depreciation
is charged from the date that the assets are available for use.

All property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of
Assets’.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the
asset is included in the Income Statement.

**Depreciation**
Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as
follows:

Freehold properties 20 - 50 years
Leasehold improvements Shorter of 20 - 50 years or the lease term
Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings 3 - 20 years

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Impairment of non-financial assets**
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is
estimated. Indefinite lived intangibles are tested annually for impairment regardless of whether any indicators
for impairment exist.

An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent
from those of other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time-value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment
losses on continuing operations are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in those expense
categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units (“CGU”) are allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and second, to reduce the carrying amount of the other
assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

**Assets held for sale**
The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that
it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn.

Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one
year from the date of the classification.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for
sale. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

**Provisions**
A provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as
a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect is material,
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time-value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

**Leases**

**_The Group as a lessee_**

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. The Group recognises a
right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the
lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). For these leases,
the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from
the leased assets are consumed.

_Lease liability_

The lease liability is initially measured at the value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement
date, discounted to present value.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

- Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

- Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

- The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and,

- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to
terminate the lease.

Lease liabilities are presented as separate current and non-current amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liability (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease
payments made.

The Group re-measures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use
asset) whenever:

- The lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in
the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is re-measured by
discounting the revised lease payments using the current discount rate;

- The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using an unchanged discount rate; or,

- A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case
the lease liability is re-measured based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised
lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.

_Discount rate_

When discounting payments to present value, the Group uses the interest rate implicit in the lease if this rate can
be readily determined. For a small volume of high value leases, the rate implicit in the lease can be calculated
and has therefore been used.

Otherwise, for the majority of leases the rate used is based on an estimated incremental borrowing rate. Further
detail on the calculation of the incremental borrowing rate is detailed in the ‘Key judgements’ section of this
note under the heading ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’.

_Right-of-use Assets_

Right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made
at or before the commencement day (including lease buy out payments made to previous tenants) less any lease
incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term. If the lease includes an option to transfer ownership of
the underlying asset, or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase
option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. Depreciation is
charged from the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified
impairment loss as described in the ‘Impairment of non-financial assets' policy above.

_Non-lease components and variable rent expense_

As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for
any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has taken this election with
the exception of IT and printer leases where other charges included in the contract (maintenance and
replenishment) are accounted for separately within related cost lines.

The primary non-lease components recognised within lease payments are property costs (service charges and
insurances) paid to landlords and included within the terms of lease contracts. These costs are included within
the lease payments at commencement date if fixed, or within variable rent expense as incurred if not. The
majority of these payments are variable and therefore not included in the lease liability.

As a lessee, the Group does not have any rent payment terms linked to sales or other variable metrics.

**_The Group as a lessor_**

The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to a small amount of its excess property and
space inside operational stores. Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating
leases. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the head lease and sub-lease are accounted for as two separate
contracts and assessment of classification is made with reference to the right-of-use asset resulting from the
head lease rather than the underlying asset. The Group currently has no leases classified as finance where it is
the lessor.

Where the Group owns the freehold, assets are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over
their useful economic lives. Rental income from operating leases, including the effect of lease incentives, is
recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Third party lessees are subject to credit checks prior to entering into a lease contract with the Group and may be
required to provide a guarantor depending on the outcome of these checks. Additionally, some leases contain
clauses enabling upwards revision of the rental charge according to prevailing market condition at points within
the lease contracts.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Financial instruments**
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.

_Financial assets and liabilities_
The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities in the following categories: non-interest-bearing financial
assets, interest bearing receivables, derivatives designated as hedging instruments, cash and cash equivalents,
non-interest-bearing financial liabilities and interest-bearing borrowings. The Group's accounting policies
relating to lease liabilities are described above.

Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.

All financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. The Group assesses financial assets for
impairment using the expected credit losses model and recognises impairment losses as required.

_Non-interest-bearing financial assets and interest-bearing receivables_
These categories include trade and other receivables and intercompany receivables which are held with the sole
objective of collecting contractual cash flows and are therefore carried at amortised cost. They are included in
current assets except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.

_Derivatives designated as hedging instruments_
Derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign
currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations.

Derivatives are stated at their fair value. The fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts is their market
value at the Balance Sheet date. Market values are calculated using mathematical models and are based on the
duration of derivative together with quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
market volatility at the Balance Sheet date. The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is measured
using a swap valuation model, this model incorporates various observable market inputs including the credit
quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies,
currency basis spreads between the respective currencies and interest rate curves.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship
is formally designated and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will
be measured throughout its duration.

All of the Group’s hedges are considered to be cash flow hedges, hedging exposure to variability in cash flows
that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable
forecast transaction. The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk in
forecast transactions and firm commitments (refer to note 19 for further details). In addition, the Group uses
cross-currency-interest-rate swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk and floating interest rate risk
relating to its foreign currency borrowings.

For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in
other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
For hedges of foreign currency purchases the gain or loss is recognised within cost of inventories. For
cross-currency-interest-rate-swaps, the gain or loss is recognised in finance costs or finance income. Amounts
recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement when the
hedged transaction affects profit or loss.

If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated Income Statement. If the hedging instrument expires
or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked,
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the
forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement.

_Non-interest-bearing financial liabilities_
The Group’s non-interest-bearing financial liabilities include trade and other payables and intercompany
payables, which are recognised at amortised cost.

_Interest-bearing borrowings_
The Group’ interest-bearing borrowings include intercompany borrowings and external borrowings and are
recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or losses arising on repurchase, settlement or
cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income or finance costs. Borrowings are
classified as current liabilities except for those with contractual maturities greater than 12 months after the
Balance Sheet date.

_Offsetting of financial instruments_
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet only when there is a
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

_Fair values_
Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent
arm’s length transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same,
discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Inventories**
Inventories comprise goods for resale and goods not for resale and are stated at the lower of cost and net
realisable value.

Goods at warehouses are valued at weighted average cost. Expenditure incurred in acquiring the goods and
bringing them to their existing location and condition (including applicable supplier income) are included in
inventories. Inventories at retail outlets are valued at average cost prices. Goods not for resale primarily
comprise fuel and are valued on a first in, first out basis.
**Taxation**
The tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement,
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised as other comprehensive income, in which case the tax is
also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.

Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes except:

- the initial recognition of goodwill or of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit
other than in a business combination;

- in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences
will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and,

- deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the asset can be utilised.

The amount of deferred tax provided is measured on an undiscounted basis based on the expected manner of
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the Balance Sheet date.

In line with the requirements of IAS 12 - Income Taxes, provisions are recognised for uncertain tax positions
where a risk of an additional tax liability is identified and it is probable that the Group will be required to settle
that tax. This will be measured based on management’s expectation of the outcome of decisions by the relevant
tax authority, assessed on a case-by-case basis using in-house tax experts, professional firms and previous
experience.

**Trade and other receivables**
Trade and other receivables are stated at their original invoiced value (discounted if material) as reduced by
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are
assessed as uncollectible.

**Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, credit and debit card receivables, short-term deposits and
short-term highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts and other
credit facilities that are repayable on demand, to the extent that they are used, are included as a component of
cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

**Trade and other payables**
Trade and other payables, other than intercompany loans, are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal
value.

**Borrowing costs**
Borrowing costs are recognised in the Group’s Income Statement except for costs that are directly attributable to
the construction of buildings which are capitalised and included within the initial cost of a building.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when the property is ready for use. The interest rate applied is based on
the average rate of general borrowings outstanding during a period.

**Defined contribution pension plans**
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an operating expense in the
consolidated Income Statement as incurred.

**Defined benefit pension assets and liabilities**
_Unapproved Unfunded Retirement Benefits Scheme ("UURBS")_
The Group’s liabilities in respect of the UURBS are calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that
employees have earned in return for their service in prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its
present value. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.

The expense relating to the unwind of the discount on the liabilities is recognised within finance costs.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income
in the period in which they occur.

_ASDA Group Pension Scheme ("AGPS")_
As described in note 21, a buy-out of the AGPS was executed during the prior period on 9 July 2021 which
extinguished the Group’s responsibility to fund the AGPS as sponsoring employer. As such, the assets and
liabilities of the AGPS, other than assets and liabilities amounting to £0.5m for which the Group remains the
sponsoring employer, were de-recognised as pension assets and liabilities during the prior period.

During the prior period, prior to the buy-out, the assets and liabilities of the AGPS met the definition of pension
assets and liabilities as set out in IAS 19 and as such, changes in fair value of the assets and liabilities of the
AGPS - including losses relating to deferred consideration paid prior to the buy-out which related to the 2019
AGPS buy-in transaction - were accounted for in other comprehensive income.

The settlement loss arising from the de-recognition of AGPS pension assets and liabilities at buy-out was
recorded as a loss within operating expenses in the consolidated Income Statement in the prior period.

**Investments**
In the Groups' financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less amounts written off.
Provision against the underlying value of the investments in subsidiary undertakings is made where, in the
opinion of the Directors, there is impairment to the value of the underlying business.

_Investments- unquoted equity_
The fair value of unquoted equity investments is determined using a market (or "income") approach. Any
change in the fair value of these investments would be taken directly through the Income Statement. The
Directors have assessed these investments for impairment at year-end and determined that no impairment was
required.

**Dividend distributions**
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

**Revenue recognition**
Revenue represents sales to customers through retail outlets and online, excluding value added tax. Revenue is
recognised net of ASDA Rewards pounds earned, intercompany transactions, colleague and Blue Light
discounts, coupons and the free element of multi-save transactions.

_Wholesale revenue_
Wholesale revenue is recognised when the goods are delivered to the wholesale customer. Sale proceeds
collected on behalf of wholesale customers are not recognised as revenue other than related commission which
is based on the terms of the contract with the wholesale customer. Revenue is recorded net of VAT.

_Income from concessions and commissions_
Income from concessions and commissions is based on the terms of the contract and is included within rental
income and other income.

_Interest and dividend income_
Interest income is recognised in the Income Statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Dividend income is recognised in the Company's profit on the date the Company’s right to receive payments is
established.

**Supplier income**
Supplier incentives, rebates, fixed income and discounts (collectively known as “supplier income”) are
recognised, as a deduction from cost of inventories recognised as an expense, as they accrue in accordance with
the terms of each relevant supplier agreement. All supplier income is supported by agreements and, in the
majority of instances, these agreements begin and end within the Group’s financial year. In a small number of
instances, contractual periods may extend over the Group’s year end. In such cases the amount of any income
accrued in relation to these agreements is supported by detailed calculations.

Supplier income is split into three classifications:

- Supplier incentives and discounts - which are usually expressed in the supplier agreement as an agreed
amount per item sold. This type of supplier income is mechanically calculated and therefore no judgement is
required in determining the amount of income to record in the financial year;

- Annual supplier rebates - these are earned and billed within the Group’s financial year in the majority of
cases. The rebates are linked to pre-agreed volumes of sales or purchases of specific products and are
supported by explicit contractual terms; and,

- Fixed amount supplier income - this is earned and billed within the Group’s financial year in the majority of
cases. Fixed monetary amounts are agreed with suppliers relating to certain promotional activities including,
for example, new product listings, increased product distribution or specific promotional events.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

Unbilled amounts of income to which the Group is contractually entitled are included in trade and other
receivables, or offset against corresponding trade payables, however these amounts are not material. Billed
amounts unpaid at the year-end are included in trade receivables or offset against corresponding trade payables
where a contractual right of offset exists.

Supplier income recognised in the Income Statement and accounted for within trade receivables (note 16) at the
year-end for which estimation and judgement is required is £1.2m (2021: £0.8m). This represents the net amount
of accrued income of £1.2m (2021: £0.8m) and deferred income of £nil (2021: £nil) on deals running across the
year-end.

**Share-based payments**
For all liabilities arising from share-based payment arrangements the Group has applied IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based
Payments’.

_Share options granted prior to the acquisition of ASDA Group Limited_
All share-based payment liabilities issued prior to the acquisition of ASDA Group Limited were settled during
the prior period. The share option programmes allowed Group employees to acquire shares of the former
ultimate parent company of ASDA Group Limited - Walmart Inc. These awards were granted by a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The fair value of options granted was initially measured at grant date
and spread over the period during which the employees became unconditionally entitled to payment. The charge
was recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value of the share
options was measured based on an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon
which the instruments were granted. The liability was re-measured at each Balance Sheet date and at settlement
date and any changes in fair value were recognised in the consolidated Income Statement during the vesting
period. These share-based payment transactions were accounted for as cash-settled.

_Management Incentive Plan_
During the year, management shares in the immediate parent company of the Group were issued to eligible
members of senior management employed by the Group as part of a Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) in
exchange for proceeds determined by an independent calculation of fair value at the issue date. Under the MIP,
an intermediate holding company of the Group - Bellis Midco 2 Limited - has entered into an agreement with
the holders of MIP management shares (“MIP scheme members”) whereby MIP scheme members are granted a
put option which, when exercised, enables them to sell their management shares to Bellis Midco 2 Limited or
another non-Group entity for a value determined by an independent valuation determined at the exercise date.

MIP scheme members are required to be employed by the Group at the grant date of the MIP shares. If a
member of the scheme ceases to be employed by the Group during the vesting period, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, a
parent of Bellis Finco PLC, has the option to repurchase, or nominate another entity of the Group to repurchase,
the shares during the 12 month period after the member’s leave date. As such, the Directors have determined
that the MIP scheme falls within the scope of IFRS 2. The difference between the IFRS 2 fair value and the fair
value paid by MIP scheme members at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period (i.e. the period from
date on which the MIP shares are granted to the estimated exercise date) as an expense in the consolidated
Income Statement.

As neither MIP shares nor put options over MIP shares are issued by entities within the Group, and as there is
no recharge agreement in place which requires any entity within the Group to settle liabilities in respect of MIP
shares, changes in the fair value of MIP shares are accounted for on an equity-settled basis.

**Reimbursement assets**
Where it is virtually certain that the Group will be reimbursed by a third party for part or all of the expenditure
required to settle a provision then it recognises the reimbursement as a separate reimbursement asset. The
amount recognised for the reimbursement is based on the amount that the Group is expected to be reimbursed
limited to the amount of the provision recognised. In the Consolidated Income Statement, the reimbursement
amount is presented separately within Other Income.

**Contingent liabilities**
The Group may, from time to time, be subject to legal proceedings. Where a liability is not probable or the
amount cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recognised. However, where a loss is not considered
probable but a liability is possible and may be material, such matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities.

**2** **Business Combinations**

_Prior period_
On 16 February 2021, Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco PLC,
acquired 100% of the entire issued share capital of ASDA Group Limited (ASDA) from ASDA Holdings UK
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Walmart Inc. (Walmart) for an enterprise value of £6,725.8m.

The agreed consideration transferred was £6,725.8m. This comprised cash consideration of £6,568.3m payable
on or after 16 February 2021 and £157.5m which was settled by ASDA on behalf of Bellis Acquisition
Company 3 Limited prior to 16 February 2021.

Included within the £6,568.3m is £6,518.0m which was settled during the prior period, £38.8m, which has been
settled during the current year, and £11.5m which is outstanding at the balance sheet date and is included in
trade and other payables.

**2** **Business Combinations (continued)**

The fair value of acquired receivables was materially equal to the contractual amounts receivable.

The acquisition resulted in a gain on bargain purchase being recognised as Other Income in the consolidated
income statement of £2,654.3m for the period ending 31 December 2021. The gain on bargain purchase arises as
a result of the valuation basis applied to individual assets in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
differing from the basis on which the purchase price was determined - notably the property valuations included
in the net assets acquired being determined on a rental yield basis compared to the purchase price being
determined based on a multiple of EBITDA. In addition, further details on internally generated intangibles,
including the ASDA and George brand licences and customer relationships, that have been capitalised are
included in note 13.

Costs directly relating to completion of the business combinations in the prior period of £92.6m have been
included in prior period operating costs in the consolidated Income Statement. These acquisition-related costs
included stamp duty and advisory fees in respect of legal, accounting, property valuation and other professional
matters. No further amounts have been incurred during the year in respect of this acquisition.

For the period ended 31 December 2021, ASDA contributed revenue of £20,710.4m and profit before tax of
£963.9m to the Group’s results. If the acquisition had occurred on 3 September 2020, management estimates
that consolidated revenue would have been £31,378.7m, and consolidated profit before tax for the period would
have been £3,145.1m. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments,
that arose on the date of acquisition would have been materially the same if the acquisition had occurred on 3
September 2020.

Reimbursement income
As a condition of the sale of ASDA to the Group, the Group was indemnified by ASDA Holdings UK Limited
("AHUKL") - a third party to the Group - in respect of tax expenses and any associated interest which may arise
as a result of events that occurred prior to 16 February 2021. During the year, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the
Group recognised tax expenses relating to corporation tax reliefs claimed by those entities in the years ending 31
December 2011 to 31 December 2017 (see note 10 for further detail). A fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the
ultimate parent undertaking of AHUKL has settled tax and interest relating to this matter on the Group's behalf
and this amount of £49.3m is included in other income.

**3** **Segment reporting**

The Group is engaged in a single reportable operating segment of business, being the retailing of food, clothing,
general merchandise, fuel and services in a single geographical segment, the United Kingdom and online. The
Group is not reliant on any individual major customers.

In line with the Group’s reporting framework and management structure, key operating decisions are made by
the Executive Committee of ASDA Group Limited which is considered to be the Chief Operating Decision
Maker for the Group. All significant revenue is generated by the sale of goods through retail outlets in the UK
and through the Group's online channels. The operations of all product areas of the business are subject to
similar economic characteristics and are sold in a similar retail environment.

The Group has taken these factors into account together with the core principles of IFRS 8 in determining that it
has a single reportable operating segment.

The analysis of the Group's revenue for the year from continuing operations is as follows:

**Year ended 31** **Period ended**
**December** **31 December**
**2022** **2021**

(i) Relates to third party advisor fees and stamp duty paid in relation to the acquisition in the prior period of the
entire issued share capital of ASDA Group Limited.
(ii) Since the acquisition of ASDA Group Limited in the prior period, the Group has embarked on a programme,
Project Future, to separate its IT systems from its previous owner Walmart. A Transitional Services Agreement
("TSA") is in place with Walmart for an initial period of three years. The separation programme will transition
the Group to a standalone, leading edge IT infrastructure which will enable it to improve operating efficiencies,
make better use of data, improve its experience for customers and colleagues, and enable the business to be
more agile in responding to customers’ needs. Amounts classified as non-underlying during the current year and
prior period relate to research spend, design and build costs relating to IT infrastructure and SAAS solutions
which cannot be capitalised (see note 1 for further detail), consultancy costs incurred in relation to the
management of the programme, run costs relating to standalone systems where equivalent legacy Walmart
systems are still in use by the business, and costs of interim software solutions which do not meet the criteria of
the Group's policy to capitalise (see note 1 for further detail). Where legacy Walmart systems are still in use, the
costs of these are included in charges relating to the TSA and as these costs arise out of the normal course of
business, they are considered to be underlying costs of the business.

(i) Cash flows in relation to transaction costs relating to the acquisition of ASDA Group Limited are as per the
the amounts expensed in the consolidated Income Statement adjusted for accruals which were outstanding at 31
December 2022 and 31 December 2021.
(ii) Operating cash flows in relation to Project Future costs are as per the the amounts expensed in the
consolidated Income Statement adjusted for related prepayments and accruals which were outstanding at 31
December 2022 and 31 December 2021. Investing cash flows relate to Project Future-related amounts incurred
in the current year and prior period which have been capitalised as intangible assets.

**Gain on bargain purchase: The amount recognised in the prior period in respect of the Group's acquisition of**
ASDA Group Limited is a non-cash item arising out of the fair value of net assets acquired being higher than the
consideration payable. For detail on the cashflows incurred in the prior period and current year in relation to the
acquisition of ASDA Group Limited, see note 2.

**Sale-and-leaseback gain: As detailed in note 9, the consideration received in the prior period by the Group in**
relation to the warehouse sale-and-leaseback transaction was in the form of an intercompany loan note from a
fellow wholly owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent company. This amount has not been settled in cash and as
such, there is no impact on the Group's cash flows in the prior period or the current year arising out of the
warehouse sale-and-leaseback.

**Reimbursed settlement relating to historic tax reliefs: As detailed in note 10, the Group's tax and interest**
liabilities to the tax authorities arising out of settlement of this matter were settled by a fellow wholly-owned
subsidiary of the ultimate parent of ASDA Holdings UK Limited ("AHUKL" - the former immediate parent of
ASDA Group Limited). This satisfied AHUKL's obligations to the Group arising out of this matter as set out in
the sale and purchase agreement relating to the Group's acquisition of ASDA and as such, there were no
cashflow impacts on the Group during the year.

**9** **Sale-and-Leaseback transaction - prior period**

On 23 June 2021, the Group entered into the sale-and-leaseback of twenty-five of its distribution properties.
Further sale-and-leasebacks for two depots were completed on 24 June 2021 and 14 October 2021 respectively.
The properties were sold at fair value to a related party, Bellis Select Warehouse Limited (BSWL), prior to
disposal to a third party.

In accordance with IFRS 15, it was determined that the transfer of the distribution properties to BSWL for
proceeds of £1,675.0m is considered a sale. In the period ended 31 December 2021, assets relating to the
distribution properties with a Net Book Value of £831.3m were sold to BSWL and the Group recognised a gain
on sale of £279.1m representing the amount of the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor
during the prior period. The remaining gain of £564.6m was deferred as a reduction to the right-of-use asset
relating to the leaseback.

On 13 July, 22 July and 21 October 2021, the distribution properties that were transferred to Bellis Select
Warehouse Limited were sold for £1,675.0m to third party entities controlled by Blackstone Group Inc. These
properties were leased back to the Group on terms ranging from 18 months to 35 years (including the
assumption that leases will be extended by 10 years, consistent with the assumptions set out in note 1). The
Group continues to lease these properties from entities controlled by Blackstone Group Inc. and has adjusted the
right of use assets and lease liabilities to reflect amended terms of the leases on transfer to the third-party entities
at that date.

The leasebacks of the depots, taking into account the deferral of a proportion of the disposal gain into the
right-of-use asset and subsequent modification to the lease term, resulted in an increase in right-of-use assets of
£624.9m and lease liabilities of £1,177.4m in the prior period.

**10 Income tax (continued)**

The standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom for the year is 19% (2021: 19%).

On 3 March 2021, it was announced in the UK Budget that the main rate of corporation tax in the United
Kingdom will increase to 25% on 1 April 2023, and this rate change was substantively enacted in May 2021.
The deferred tax liability is calculated using the tax rate at which it is expected to unwind (of between 19% and
25% for 2021 and 2022). The tax charge in relation to the rate change in the prior period is £280.9m. The future
increase in tax rates to 25% was substantively enacted in the prior period and the full deferred tax liability was
revalued to reflect this rate change. The rate change credit of £17m mostly relates to new deferred tax assets
arising in the year for trading losses and for interest disallowed under the Corporate Interest Restriction to be
reactivated in future years (interest carried forward).

(a) Adjustments in respect of previous years of £46.0m includes a tax expense of £40.3m relating to corporation
tax reliefs claimed in the years ending 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2017. This tax together with interest
of £9.0m was reimbursable by a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASDA Holdings UK Limited's ("AHUKL's")
ultimate parent under an indemnity it provided on the sale of ASDA (note 2). The total reimbursement income
of £49.3m is included as other income in the income statement. This is non-taxable income for the Group. A
wholly-owned subsidiary of AHUKL's ultimate parent settled this tax and interest directly on the Group's behalf.

(b) The prior period tax credit in relation to the sale-and-leaseback of the Group’s distribution properties was
£74.2m. A tax credit arose on the transaction, despite an accounting gain of £279.1m. The tax on the chargeable
gain on disposal (after the offset of capital losses) was £74.0m, of which £65.2m was recognised in the prior
period. However, a deferred tax asset of £139.4m arose where the accounting gain on the disposal of fixed assets
was deferred as a reduction of the right-of-use asset of the leaseback, as the full proceeds were taxed as a capital
gain.

**10 Income tax (continued)**

Capital losses carried forward at 31 December 2022 are £68.6m (2021: £20.1m) of which £24.1m (2021: £7.0m)
are recognised and £44.5m (2021: £13.1m) are unrecognised. Capital losses are not recognised where, at the
balance sheet date, it is not considered probable that the losses will be used. The increase in capital losses in
2022 relates to the finalisation of the chargeable gains calculations for the sale and leaseback in 2021. In 2022,
£5.0m of capital losses were used. Capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely.

A deferred tax asset has been recognised at 31 December 2022 in relation to trading losses carried forward of
£220.5m and disallowed interest carried forward under the UK Corporate Interest Restriction of £195.5m. The
utilisation of these assets is dependent upon future taxable profits, which we expect to arise through future
reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. These attributes can be carried forward indefinitely.

The Group leases various offices, stores, warehouses, vehicles and equipment under agreements within the
scope of IFRS 16.

Leases of land and buildings have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights, however they commonly
include either a market rent review or index linked rent review with a cap and collar. The timing of when rent
reviews take place differs for each lease. They have no purchase options. Impairment charges of £6.9m (2021:
£nil) were recognised during the year. The impairment charge in the year is driven primarily by declining
performance of two sites.

Average remaining lease term is 37 years (2021: 32 years). This figure is a weighted average which is calculated
using undiscounted future lease payments whereas the prior period figure was calculated using discounted future
lease payments. Due to the increase in discount rates during the year, the Directors believe that a weighted
average lease term based on undiscounted payments is more representative and the calculation has been updated
accordingly. The weighted average lease term at 31 December 2021 using undiscounted future lease payments
would have been 38 years.

Leases of plant, vehicles and equipment have various terms but typically do not include mid-term rent reviews
or extension options. They have no purchase options. The average remaining lease term is 4 years (2021: 4
years).

Included within prior period additions of £742.0m is £624.9m relating to the sale and leaseback transaction. This
is stated net of a £564.6m deferral of the gain on sale. The remaining additions related to renewals or
modifications of previously existing leases for land and buildings, new leases for plant, vehicles and equipment,
alongside modifications to the lease term on the sale and leaseback properties.

Additions during the year relate primarily to renewals or modifications of previously existing leases for land and
buildings; and new leases for plant, vehicles and equipment.

For further details of lease liabilities please see note 25.

**Impairment testing of indefinite life intangibles**

**_George brand licence_**
This asset relates to the acquisition in 2021 of a perpetual licence to use the George brand in the UK and
elsewhere in Europe and has a carrying value of £463.8m (2021: £463.8m). This has been tested for impairment
as at 31 December 2022 by assessing the present value of forecasted cash flows arising from the George
clothing business.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from
financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period. Forecasts are extrapolated to
five years based on management's expectations and beyond five years using estimated long term average growth
rates. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 11.0% (2021: 8.0%).

Based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis undertaken, management believe that no reasonably
possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be lower than the
carrying value of the George brand.

**_ASDA brand_**
This asset relates to the acquisition in 2021 of the ASDA brand and has a carrying value of £863.4m (2021:
£863.4m). This has been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2022 by assessing the present value of
forecasted cash flows arising from the ASDA business.

461.8                                        At 31 December

On 29 October 2022, Asda Stores Limited - a wholly owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco plc - purchased 100% of
the share capital of Arthur Foodstores Limited, a grocery retailer operating in the United Kingdom for an initial
purchase price of £461.8m. This comprises initial cash consideration of £423.6m, of which £228.6m has been
funded from cash in hand and £195.0m has been raised through the issue of additional senior facilities of
£200.0m, less bank fees of £5.0m; and a loan balance owing to Arthur Foodstores Limited of £38.2m. Prior to
completion of the acquisition, the seller owed a balance of £38.2m to Arthur Foodstores Limited. This liability
was novated to the Group on completion at 29 October 2022 as part of the Sale and Purchase Agreement.

On 26 October 2022 the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order
(“IEO”) under section 72 (2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Asda Stores Limited; Asda Group Limited; Mr
Mohsin Issa; Mr Zuber Issa; TDR Capital LLP; TDR Capital III Portfolio No. 2 L.P.; TDR Capital III
Investments (2019) L.P.; Co-operative Group Limited and Arthur Foodstores Limited. The IEO commenced on
30 October 2022. The IEO requires the Group to effectively ‘hold separate’ the Arthur business. An independent
management team has been appointed to run the Arthur business during the IEO period and the parties are
prohibited from performing any integration activities or exchanging of commercially sensitive information.

At 31 December 2022, as a result of the IEO restrictions, the Group has concluded that it does not have control
of Arthur Foodstores Limited and therefore the results of the business are not consolidated in these financial
statements. The Group expects to obtain control over Arthur Foodstores Limited from the date that the IEO is
lifted, unless there are significant derogations from the CMA entered into before this date which provide
evidence of the Group obtaining control. From the date control is obtained, Arthur Foodstores Limited will be
consolidated into the Group accounts.

On 14 March 2023 the CMA delivered its Phase 1 decision in respect of its investigation into the Group’s
acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Ltd. They identified 13 potential areas for competition concern, with the
potential for local remedies. The Group has offered to dispose of the 13 sites in question and the CMA has
indicated that it considers that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the undertakings offered, or a
modified version of them, might be accepted by the CMA under the Enterprise Act 2002.

Trade receivables are non interest-bearing and are generally on 30 day terms. Trade receivable balances have
been assessed to determine the value of expected credit losses ("ECLs") using the simplified approach in IFRS
9.

Trade receivables are presented net where a legally enforceable right of set off exists. Included in the above is an
offset of £166.1m (2021: £210.2m). The trade receivable prior to the offset is £260.8m (2021: £286.5m).

Other receivable balances have been assessed to determine the value of ECLs as per the requirements of IFRS 9
and the impact is £nil (2021: £nil).

The Group considers its trade and other receivables in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due.
However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a trade or other receivable to be in default when internal
or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full
before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A trade or other receivable is written off
to the Consolidated Income Statement when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual
cash flows.

The non-current intercompany receivable balance of £747.4m (2021: £1,722.0m) is largely due to the
intercompany receivables arising out of the sale-and-leaseback transaction, as properties owned by the Group
were sold to a fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent undertaking in exchange for an
intercompany receivable. During the year, £1,023.8m of this receivable was used as consideration to settle an
intercompany payable owing to the immediate parent undertaking.

Loans receivable of £26.6m include a balance of £23.6m arising out of cash lent to Arthur Foodstores Limited,
largely in order to enable that entity to satisfy short-term working capital requirements; and a further balance of
£3.0m which was transferred to the Group on 29 October 2022. These balances have been assessed to determine
the value of ECLs as per the requirements of IFRS 9 and the impact is £nil (2021: £nil).

Non-current

The Group deals with over ten thousand separate suppliers and has established trading terms which are
appropriate to the particular relationship and product supplied. Whenever an order is placed the parties will be
aware of the payment terms and it is the Group’s policy to abide by these terms when satisfactory invoices have
been received.

Trade receivables are presented net where a legally enforceable right of offset exists. Included in the above is an
offset of £166.1m (2021: £210.2m). The trade payable prior to the offset is £3,407.5m (2021: £3,141.1m).

The decrease in non-current interest-bearing intercompany payables of £967.4m since 31 December 2021 was
driven by settlement of intercompany payables owing to the Company’s immediate parent of £1,023.8m using
intercompany receivable balances, partially offset by intercompany interest payable accrued during the year
prior to settlement of £56.4m.

**_Movements in liabilities arising from financing activities_**
External borrowings comprise the financing drawn down to fund the acquisition of ASDA Group Limited (see
note 2) and a loan entered into during the year to finance the acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Limited. Further
details of external borrowings are disclosed in note 20.

On 16 February 2021, the Group entered into two Revolving Credit Facilities (RCF) totalling £690.0m with
£190.0m maturing in February 2022 and £500.0m maturing in July 2025. Fees paid relating to the RCFs of
£10.5m have been capitalised and will be expensed over the term of the facilities. Amortisation of £2.1m (2021:
£3.3m) was charged in the year. The carrying amount of RCF fees at 31 December 2022 was £5.1m (2021:
£7.2m). On 16 September 2021, the Group voluntarily cancelled the £190.0m RCF. The Group retains the
availability of the £500.0m RCF.

On 26 July 2021, the Group entered into a framework agreement in respect of a short-term working capital
facility. The facility provides the Group with a credit facility pursuant to which payment to the relevant
beneficiaries and suppliers is made by ASDA Stores Limited using the facility on the relevant invoice due date,
with ASDA Stores Limited then settling these liabilities in the normal course of business. An amount of £39.1m
(2021: £16.2m) is outstanding on this facility at 31 December 2022 and is included in other payables.

On 5 November 2021, the Group repaid the £750.0m Forecourt Asset Disposal Bridge Facility including
accrued interest through the issuance of £500.0m 4.5% Senior Secured Notes due in February 2026 and cash on
hand of £255.4m.

On 24 July 2022, the Group entered into a framework agreement in respect of a short-term working capital
facility. The facility was unused as at 31 December 2022.

Total lease cash outflow in the year was £300.4m (2021: £246.5m). Amounts included in financing activities in
the cash flow statement are cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability £131.9m (2021:
£123.2m) and cash payments for the interest portion of the lease liability of £145.2m (2021: £102.3m). £23.3m
(2021: £21.0m) has been included in operating activities in the cash flow statement and relates to short term and
variable lease expenses.

**_Security pledged_**
The Group pledged certain assets as security for the indebtedness of parent undertakings in the form of a
first-ranking charge over certain material bank accounts, material intercompany receivables, the shares owned
by the Group in ASDA Stores Limited, McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood House Group Limited,
and a first-ranking floating charge over all present and future assets (other than customarily excluded assets) of
ASDA Group Limited, ASDA Stores Limited, McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood House Group
Limited.

Part of the security pledged is in relation to some of the Group’s existing supply chain finance agreements in the
form of fixed and floating charges over certain of the Group’s assets. There were no other changes to the terms
of these supply chain finance agreements which impact on the nature of amounts owed to the bank under these
arrangements. Given consideration of this and the other factors set out in note 1, the Directors have concluded
that the substance of the Group’s liabilities under all supply chain financing agreements remain consistent
overall with that of a trade payable and accordingly will continue to be accounted for and classified as trade
payables.

On 13 August 2021, the Group entities that guarantee the Senior Secured Notes issued by Bellis Acquisition
Company PLC, the Term Loan Facilities and the Forecourt Bridge Facility borrowed by Bellis Acquisition
Company PLC and the Revolving Credit Facility made available to the Group granted first-priority security
interests over their Material Real Property to secure their obligations under those instruments. With the
completion of this security grant, the Group has discharged the requirement to deliver post-closing collateral
under the various financing arrangements established in connection with the acquisition of ASDA by the Group.
Upon the issuance of additional Senior Secured Notes on 5 November 2021 by Bellis Acquisition Company
PLC, the Group is required to grant further first-priority security interests over their Material Real Property to
secure their obligations under these instruments. This grant of this security was completed on 5 May 2022.

The Group’s principal financial instruments during the year comprised cash, cash equivalents, external
borrowings, intercompany payables and receivables, derivatives classified as hedges and lease liabilities. Other
financial assets and liabilities, such as trade receivables, other receivables, trade payables, other payables, and
accruals arise directly from the Group’s operating activities. Set out in the table below is a comparison, by class,
of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial instruments. This table excludes trade
receivables, other receivables, trade payables, other payables, accruals, intercompany receivables, intercompany
payables and lease liabilities as the carrying value reasonably approximates the fair value of these financial
instruments. Derivative instruments are also excluded as the carrying value equals fair value at the period end.

The Group measures the fair value of its financial instruments by reference to the fair value hierarchy in IFRS
13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’:

- Level 1 - using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

- Level 2 - using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly; and

- Level 3 - using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial
instruments:

For listed and traded instruments (i.e. Senior Secured Notes, Senior Unsecured Notes and Euro Term Loan B)
over-the-counter prices are used to determine the fair value (Level 2). For unlisted instruments the fair value is
estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using prevailing interest rates to net present value
(Level 2).

_Intercompany payables and receivables_
The fair value of fixed rate intercompany payables and receivables is estimated by discounting the future
contracted cash flow using prevailing interest rates to net present value. The fair values of the Group's
intercompany payables and receivables have been calculated at the observable unquoted interest rates and are
categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

_Derivatives_
Forward contracts - these derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of
forward contracts entered into and are split between in-the-money (assets) and out-of-the-money (liabilities). At
31 December 2022, the Group held £24.0m (2021: £14.1m) in-the-money assets, and £17.3m (2021: £1.4m)
out-of-the-money liabilities in respect of its forward contracts. During the year, the Group recognised net losses
on revaluation of hedged monetary assets and liabilities from historical cost to period-end spot rate of £2.7m
(2021: £0.3m gains). The fair values of the Group's financial derivatives have been calculated at the observable
unquoted interest rates and are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

_Cross-currency interest rate swaps_
These derivatives are measured at fair value using a swap valuation model. The model incorporates various
observable market inputs (Level 2) including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and
forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies
and interest rate curves. The model incorporates a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative
counter-party default risk. These derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates
of cross-currency interest rate swaps entered into and are split between in-the-money (assets) and
out-of-the-money (liabilities). At 31 December 2022, the Group held £36.0m (2021: £nil) in-the-money assets,
and £nil (2021: £22.7m) out-of-the-money liabilities in respect of its cross-currency interest rate swaps.

_Investments- fair value through profit and loss_
The fair value of the investment in Arthur Foodstores Limited on initial recognition was considered to be the
purchase price. Prior to acquiring the investment in Arthur Foodstores Limited the Directors performed a
valuation exercise using a “market” (or “income”) approach. As the acquisition occurred in close proximity to
the year end and the Directors are not aware of any material changes to the underlying business, they are
satisfied that the price paid equates to fair value at the year end. The key assumptions used in the valuation
performed are the underlying EBITDA generated by Arthur Foodstores Limited in the preceding 12 months,
combined with expected ongoing synergy benefits generated by the Group as a result of this investment; and a
multiple applied to this combined amount. If either of these were to be sensitised by 5% this would change the
valuation by £23.1m. £461.8m is both the carrying value and fair value of the investment at 31 December 2022.

**_Financial risk management_**
In the ordinary course of the Group’s business, it is exposed to a variety of market risks arising in relation to its
financial assets and liabilities, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and
capital risk. The Group has a risk management programme in place through which it seeks to mitigate the
adverse effects of these market risks. In addition, The Group hedges interest and exchange rate exposure on
foreign currency debt obligations. The Group does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes.

_Interest rate risk_
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate liabilities (based on SONIA and EURIBOR)
primarily composed of the Senior Facilities, which consist of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A, Term
Loan B and Arthur Additional Bridge Facility. The EURIBOR interest rate risk on Facility B is hedged through
entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps to fix the interest payments in pound sterling at rates between
3.70% - 3.76%. The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes are set at fixed rates between 3.25%
and 4.50%.

The Group, after the impact of hedge accounting, is exposed to possible changes in SONIA on its outstanding
floating rate loan (Term Loan A and Arthur Additional Bridge Facility). It is anticipated that a 0.5% increase in
the SONIA rate would give rise to a decrease in profit before tax of £1.2m (2021: £0.9m).

The Group’s Term Loan A, Arthur Additional Bridge Facility and Revolving Credit Facilities have been
impacted by the interest rate benchmark reform. The Group has transitioned these agreements to the new UK
risk-free rate benchmark, SONIA, which was applied to the Group’s interest period starting 1 April 2022.

_Foreign currency risk_

_Forward currency hedging contracts_
The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be
affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are
managed using forward contracts.

The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31
December 2022, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward
currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases. The terms of the
forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none
exceed a period of more than 12 months after 31 December 2022. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive
income are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.

The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31
December 2022, a net unrealised gain of £36.2m (2021: £43.7m gain) was included in the hedge reserve in
respect of hedging contracts. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect
of these hedging contracts was £7.5m (2021: £43.7m gain). This consists of a £14.4m (2021: £11.6m) gain on
not-yet-matured contracts during the year, £23.4m of gains reclassified to the Income Statement during the year
(2021: £42.3m losses) and a £1.5m taxation credit (2021: £10.2m charge).

Under the Group’s hedging policy, forward currency contracts can be used for both goods for resale and goods
not for resale. The only items for which forward currency contracts are in place as at 31 December 2022 are
forecast purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 100% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses
attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the
Income Statement at the point of sale. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash
flows would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the year,
therefore, amounts recognised in the Income Statement in relation to ineffective forward contract hedges is £nil
(2021: £nil).

At 31 December 2022, the Group held £749.5m (2021: £699.9m) of outstanding forward foreign currency
contracts, designated as cash flow hedges. These forward contracts are largely in relation to purchases of US
Dollars (notional $908.4m) and Euros (notional €7.1m) with varying maturities up to December 2023. For the
above currencies the rates ranged from USD/GBP from 1.098 to 1.369 (2021: 1.315 to 1.420) and Euro/GBP
1.132 to 1.157 (2021: 1.165 to 1.189).

As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure using forward currency contracts, changes in
exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short-term profitability or cash flow. It is
anticipated that a 5% movement in the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management’s
assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of
£34.6m (2021: £33.5m).

_Cross-currency swap_
The Group has entered into a floating rate Euro denominated Term Loan B. The non-GBP interest and principal
repayment cash flows from the Euro debt agreement expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates that impact profit or loss on a consolidated basis.

Under the Group’s hedging policy, the Group hedges both the foreign exchange and interest rate risk associated
with a portion of the Group’s existing, Euro foreign-currency denominated debt using EUR-GBP cross currency
interest rate swap contracts to effectively eliminate variability in the Group’s functional currency equivalent
cash flows due to variability in the EUR-GBP exchange rate and the variable interest rate. The hedge ratio is
100% on a current notional basis. The Group has excluded from the cross-currency interest rate swap both the
time value and currency basis elements of the cross-currency interest rate swap. Ineffectiveness could arise from
movements in counterparty credit spread, the non-zero fair value at the hedge designation date due to market
changes that have occurred since the instrument’s inception and changes to critical terms (e.g. reset dates, index
mismatches, payment dates). To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method
and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the change in fair value of the
hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. The amounts recognised in the Income Statement for the period
ended 31 December 2022 relating to ineffectiveness and excluded items was less than £0.1m.

At 31 December 2022, the Group holds cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) with a total nominal value
of €844.5m, designated as cash flow hedges. These swaps result in a fixed GBP interest rate ranging from
3.70% to 3.76% and EUR/GBP rate of 1.1412.

The CCIRSs were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2022, a net unrealised gain of £21.2m
(2021: £6.6m) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net gain recognised in other
comprehensive income during the year in respect of these swaps was £14.5m (2021: £7.3m). This consists of a
£35.5m gain reclassified to the Income Statement during the year (2021: £34.5m loss) and a net loss debited to
the cost of hedging reserve of £0.1m (2021: £0.7m net gain), offset by a £54.9m gain (2021: £25.5m loss) on the
fair value of the swaps at period end and a taxation charge of £4.8m (2021: £2.4m).

The value of the CCIRSs are sensitive to movements in EURIBOR and EUR/GBP exchange rates. A 0.5%
change in EURIBOR results in a £2.9m (2021: £6.5m) change in value of the CCIRSs and a 5% change in the
EUR/GBP exchange rates results in a £38.9m (2021: £38.1m) change in the value of the CCIRSs. The amounts
charged to the income statement are not sensitive to a change in interest rates but a 5% increase in the FX rate
increases the amount of ineffectiveness by £nil (2021: £0.4m).

_Credit risk_

The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is included in their carrying value as at the
Balance Sheet date. See note 16 for further information on trade receivables and intercompany receivables and
details of recoverability.

The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default in relation to trade receivables including
detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted.

Surplus cash is placed in both short-term deposits and money market funds with various global financial
institutions. This is managed by the Group Treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to
identify the best terms of deposit in keeping with internal objectives. This includes monitoring the credit rating
of counterparties and investing in accordance with our internal policy. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed
on a monthly basis, and may be updated throughout the financial year. The limits are set to minimise the
concentration of risk and are set taking into account the type of financial asset and the credit rating of the
financial institution.

Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses model under IFRS 9 and
no impairment is required.

_Liquidity risk_

The Group’s Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring
rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash flows. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity
of funding and flexibility using operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At 31 December 2022, the
RCF and overdraft facilities are unutilised.

At 31 December 2022, the Group held cash of £662.5m (2021: £505.5m) to secure short-term flexibility. The
amount of financing facilities available at the year/period end are disclosed below:

_Capital risk management_

The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure may not be sufficient to support the growth of its
business and maintain its existing credit rating. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt obligations
(including the Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes, term loans and the Senior Unsecured Notes) and
equity (issued share capital, share premium and reserves).

Part of the Group's capital risk management strategy is to monitor a broad range of financial metrics and manage
compliance with financial covenants relating to the Group's debt obligations. As at 31 December 2022, there
have been no breaches of financial covenants.

**20 Borrowings (continued)**

During the year, the Group issued the following notes and loans:

- An additional senior facility with a par value of £200.0m was entered into on 28 October 2022 in order to fund
the acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Limited. This facility attracts interest of SONIA +7.75% per annum and
payments of interest are made on a semi-annual basis. The loan matures on 28 October 2023 and has therefore
been classified as current.

During the prior period, the Group issued the following notes and loans:

- Senior unsecured notes with a par value of £500.0m were issued on 24 February 2021. These notes attract
interest at 4.0% per annum and payments of interest are made on a semi-annual basis. The notes mature on 16
February 2027 and have therefore been classified as non-current. These notes are listed on The International
Stock Exchange ("TISE").

- Senior secured notes with a par value of £2,250.0m were issued on 24 February 2021. These notes attract
interest at 3.25% per annum and payments of interest are made on a semi-annual basis. The notes mature on 16
February 2026 and have therefore been classified as non-current. These notes are listed on TISE.

- Term loan A with a par value of £195.0m was entered into on 16 February 2021. This loan attracts interest at
SONIA + 3.25% per annum (2021: LIBOR + 3.25%) and payments of interest are made on a semi-annual basis.
This loan matures on 16 August 2025 and has therefore been classified as non-current.

- Euro term loan B with a par value of €845.0m was entered into on 16 February 2021. This loan attracts interest
at EURIBOR + 2.75% per annum and payments of interest are made on a semi-annual basis. This loan matures
on 16 February 2026 and has therefore been classified as non-current. The Group has entered into Cross
Currency Interest Rate Swaps relating to Euro Term Loan B to hedge the foreign currency and interest rate risk
on both the principal and interest payments. This effectively fixes the interest payments in GBP at a rate of
3.73%. This term loan is listed on TISE.

- Sterling senior secured notes with a par value of £500.0m were entered into on 5 November 2021. These notes
attract interest at 4.5% per annum and payments of interest are made on a semi-annual basis. The notes mature
on 16 February 2026 and have therefore been classified as non-current. These notes are listed on TISE.

- Forecourt Bridge Loan with a par value of £750.0m was entered into on 16 February 2021. This loan attracted
interest at LIBOR +7.75%, with a step-up of 0.5% each quarter and payments of interest were made on a
semi-annual basis. This loan along with fees and interest accrued was repaid in full on 5 November 2021
through the issuance of £500.0m of 4.5% Sterling senior secured notes due in February 2026 and cash on hand
in ASDA Group Limited of £255.4m.

- Sterling senior secured notes bridging facility with a par value of £2,250.0m was entered into on 16 February
2021 and re-financed on 24 February 2021 through the issue of the Senior secured notes with a par value of
£2,250.0m referred to above. The interest costs on this bridge loan were repaid through cash on hand in ASDA
Group Limited.

2021 and re-financed on 24 February 2021 through the issue of the Senior unsecured notes with a par value of
£500.0m referred to above. The interest costs on this bridge loan were repaid through cash on hand in ASDA
Group Limited.

The Group also entered into two Revolving Credit Facilities (RCF) totalling £690.0m with £190.0m maturing in
February 2022 and £500.0m maturing in July 2025. During the prior period, it was deemed that the RCF of
£190.0m was no longer required and on 16 September 2021 this facility was voluntarily cancelled. At 31
December 2021 and 31 December 2022, there was £nil drawn down on the remaining £500.0m facility.

Other current borrowings with a carrying value at 31 December 2022 of £41.0m include a balance owed to
Arthur Foodstores Limited (“Arthur”) by the Group of £38.2m in relation to a loan agreement entered into by
Arthur’s former parent prior to 29 October 2022, which was novated to the Group on completion of the
acquisition as part of the Sale & Purchase Agreement - see note 15 for further detail. A further loan balance with
a carrying value of £2.8m owed by the Group to Arthur in relation to other matters is outstanding at 31
December 2022.

Following the recognition of the liabilities under the debt agreements disclosed above, the Group also

funded, the ASDA Group Pension Scheme (“AGPS” or "the Scheme") and one unfunded, the Unapproved
Unfunded Retirement Benefit Scheme ("UURBS”).

_Background to the AGPS buy-in and buy-out_
The AGPS was subject to a buy-in transaction ("the buy-in") on 17 October 2019 through the purchase of a bulk
purchase annuity (“BPA”) policy with the insurer Rothesay Life PLC (“Rothesay”), under which the benefits
payable to all AGPS pensioners and deferred members became fully insured. In order to enable the AGPS to
execute the buy-in, ASDA Stores made a contribution in 2019 to the AGPS of £707.5m (“the buy-in
contribution”) and advanced a loan to the Scheme with an original book value of £467.3m ("the buy-in loan").
Interest is charged at an arms-length rate on this loan. To the extent that the AGPS is unable to settle the buy-in
loan balance in full out of the proceeds realised through the liquidation of assets retained by the Scheme after
buy-in, ASDA Stores is contractually obliged under a back-to-back agreement (“the BTB Agreement”) to make
a contribution to the Scheme to the value of the shortfall between the assets in the Scheme and the outstanding
balance on the buy-in loan, the proceeds of which can be used by the Scheme to settle outstanding amounts on
the buy-in loan. At the point of the buy-in, the Scheme retained ownership of various assets, including illiquid
investments and cash, some of which will be required to meet ongoing expenses incurred by the Scheme and the
remainder of which the Scheme has used and will continue to use to repay principal and interest on the buy-in
loan.

On 9 July 2021, the Trustees of AGPS completed a full buy-out of the Scheme with Rothesay. Other than
estimated pension liabilities of £0.5m (“the retained liabilities”) for which ASDA Stores remains sponsoring
employer, together with Scheme assets to that value which will be used to settle the retained liabilities, the
buy-out extinguished ASDA Stores’ responsibility for funding the AGPS as sponsoring employer and as such,
all other assets and liabilities of the AGPS were de-recognised from the Group consolidated balance sheet
during the prior period. See further detail below for amounts recognised in the consolidated Statement of Other
Comprehensive Income and the consolidated Income Statement in respect of this.

_Amounts recognised in Other Comprehensive Income - prior period_
Prior to the buy-out on 9 July 2021, as the remaining assets of the AGPS were held within the Scheme as a
separate legal entity from the Group and could be used to settle pension liabilities in the event of a shortfall from
the BPA, they met the definition of pension assets under IAS 19 - Employee Benefits. As such, changes in the
fair value of Scheme assets and liabilities in the period prior to 9 July 2021 were accounted for as actuarial gains
and losses in other comprehensive income with a total net actuarial loss recognised of £13.9m, including an
amount of £15.1m in respect of deferred consideration for the BPA arising out of the buy-in transaction.

Further to the above, an actuarial gain of £0.7m was recognised in respect of actuarial movements relating to the
liabilities of the UURBS.

Total pre-tax net losses recognised in other comprehensive income during the prior period were £13.2m.

_Settlement loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement - prior period_
As described above, to the extent that the AGPS is unable to make repayments of principal amounts outstanding
on the buy-in loan out of Scheme assets, ASDA Stores is obliged under the BTB Agreement to make a
contribution to the AGPS to the value of the shortfall. At the point of buy-out, the Directors estimated the
amount outstanding on the buy-in loan which the Scheme will be able to settle without recourse to the BTB to
be £11.5m and as such, this amount was reclassified to other receivables at the point of buy-out. The difference
between the net carrying amount of Scheme assets and liabilities and the recoverable amount of the buy-in loan
at the date of buyout - after accounting for the net actuarial loss of £13.9m described above - was £8.7m. This
amount was recognised as a settlement loss within operating expenses in the prior period.

_Amounts recognised in the consolidated Income Statement - current year_
Interest expense of £0.3m has been recognised during the year in relation to the unwind of discount on the
liabilities of the UURBS.

_Amounts recognised in Other Comprehensive Income - current year_
Pre-tax net gains of £5.5m have been recognised during the year in relation to actuarial movements on the
liabilities of the UURBS. No actuarial gains or losses on the retained assets and liabilities of the AGPS have
arisen during the year.

_Classification of AGPS pension cashflows_
During the year, the AGPS has made repayments of principal on the buy-in loan of nil (2021: £38.5m) and
interest payments of £0.7m (2021: £0.5m). These are presented as investing inflows on the Consolidated
Statement of Cash Flows.

**Fair value of plan assets:**
At 31 December 2022 the fair value of plan assets was £0.5m (2021: £0.5m). This relates to cash and cash
equivalents.

Following the buy-in in October 2019, up to the date of the buy-out on 9 July 2021, the Scheme held a bulk
purchase annuity which fully insured the pension liabilities of the Scheme. Further, the Scheme retained
ownership of a variety of illiquid assets and cash balances which are measured at fair value and described earlier
in this note. From 9 July 2021, the Group is no longer the sponsoring employer of the Scheme and as such, the
BPA and other assets of the Scheme have been de-recognised as pension assets as they no longer meet the
definition of a pension asset under IAS 19, other than an amount of £0.5m retained in the AGPS to settle £0.5m
of retained AGPS liabilities.

**_Principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages)_**
The significant actuarial assumptions used to determine the present value of the defined benefit obligation at the

**Sensitivity analysis**
Sensitivity analysis has not been presented as the remaining carrying value of defined benefit pension liabilities
is not material.

**Share-based payments**

Share-based payment transactions are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payments’.

The total expenses recognised for the year arising from share-based payments are as follows:

_Settlement of share-based payment liabilities in the prior period_
As a result of the Sale & Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) relating to the acquisition by the Group of the entire
issued share capital of ASDA Group Limited from ASDA Holdings UK Limited (“the Acquisition”) on 16
February 2021, all share awards granted to employees prior to the Acquisition under the Walmart Stock
Incentive Plan (“WSIP”) scheme, Restricted Stock Rights (“RSR”) scheme and Performance Share Plan
(“PSP”) scheme vested according to the proportion of the relevant vesting or performance period that had
elapsed as at the Acquisition date of 16 February 2021. Furthermore, options granted prior to the Acquisition
date to participants in the Sharesave scheme were exercised in the six-month period following completion of the
Acquisition. As a result, all share-based payment liabilities of the Group were extinguished during the prior
period. The carrying value of share-based payment liabilities relating to these schemes at 31 December 2022 is
£nil (2021: £nil).

Details of changes in the share-based payments liabilities relating to the pre-Acquisition schemes are provided
in the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 December 2021 which are
available from the registered office of the Group - Waterside Head Office, Haslingden Road, Guide, Blackburn,
Lancashire, United Kingdom, BB1 2FA.
_Management Incentive Plan- current year_
During the year, management shares in the immediate parent company of the Group were issued to eligible
members of senior management employed by the Group as part of a Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) in
exchange for proceeds determined by an independently determined fair value calculated at the issue date. Under
the MIP, an intermediate holding company of the Group - Bellis Midco 2 Limited - has entered into an
agreement with the holders of MIP management shares (“MIP scheme members”) whereby MIP scheme
members are granted put options which, when exercised, enable them to sell their management shares to Bellis
Midco 2 Limited or another non-Group entity for a value which is based on an independent valuation
determined at the exercise date.

MIP scheme members are required to be employed by the Group at the grant date of the MIP shares. If a
member of the scheme ceases to be employed by the Group during the vesting period, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, a
parent of Bellis Finco PLC, has the option to repurchase, or nominate another entity of the Group to repurchase,
the shares during the 12 month period after the member’s leave date. As such, the Directors have determined
that the MIP scheme falls within the scope of IFRS 2. The difference between the IFRS 2 fair value and the fair
value paid by MIP scheme members at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period (i.e. the period from
date on which the MIP shares are granted to the estimated exercise date) as an expense in the consolidated
Income Statement.

As neither MIP shares nor put options over MIP shares are issued by entities within the Group, and as there is
no recharge agreement in place which requires any entity within the Group to settle liabilities in respect of MIP
shares, changes in the fair value of MIP shares are accounted for on an equity-settled basis.

The fair value of the options outstanding under the MIP scheme at 31 December 2022 is £4.8m (2021: nil).

An amount of £0.7m (2021: £nil) has been accounted for as an equity-settled share based payments expense in
respect on the MIP in accordance with the proportion of the vesting period which has elapsed during the year.

Non-current liabilities

The insurance provision above relates to claims liabilities arising from past events such as accidents in our
depots and stores which are not covered by third party insurance. The value of the provision is established using
independent actuarial assessments or a reasonable estimate based on past experience. These provisions are
expected to crystallise within 5 years. Insurance liabilities are not discounted as the impact would not be
material.

The dilapidation provision represents provisions for the cost of works required to remove leasehold
improvements within leasehold properties at the end of their lease term. The amount provided during the year is
accounted for as an increase or decrease in the cost of property, plant and equipment and the impact of this will
be recognised as depreciation over the lease terms of the sites to which the provision relates. The decrease in the
year is reflected in disposals (see note 11). A discount rate of 4.0% (2021: 1.1%) has been used in determining
this provision. The provision will be utilised at the end of the respective terms of the leases giving rise to these
liabilities.

**27 Contingent liabilities**

_Equal Value Claims_
ASDA Stores Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, has been served with circa 50,000 employment
tribunal claims that have been presented on behalf of current and former ASDA store employees, who allege
that their work in ASDA's stores is of equal value in terms of the demands of their jobs to that of employees
working in ASDA's distribution centres, and that the differences in pay and terms and conditions between the
different jobs are not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher
wage rates in the distribution centres and those higher wage rates and more favourable terms and conditions on a
prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be served.

At present, the Directors cannot predict the number of claims that may be served, and cannot reasonably
estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. On 26 March 2021, the Supreme Court
upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, that the work of hourly-paid workers in distribution centres and the work
of hourly-paid workers in stores can be compared. Despite this ruling, the Directors believe that there are
substantial factual and legal defences to these claims, and intend to defend the claims vigorously. No provision
continues to be recognised on the basis that any potential liability is only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be
confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits.

As a result of the change of ownership on 16 February 2021, the Group have entered into an indemnification
agreement which is guaranteed by the former ultimate parent of ASDA Stores Limited, Walmart Inc.
("Walmart") with respect to these claims. Walmart has indemnified the Group for these claims up to a
contractually agreed amount.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued)

**28 Related parties (continued)**

Amounts owed by fellow group entities totalled £751.4m at 31 December 2022 (2021: £1,724.3m), as disclosed
in note 16.

Amounts owed to fellow group entities totalled £6.8m at 31 December 2022 (2021: £968.7m), as disclosed in
note 18.

During the year ended 31 December 2022, the Group also earned parking income from Paragon Automotive
Limited and at the end of the period, there were balances outstanding due from Paragon Automotive Limited.
Additionally, the Group earned income for distribution services from Leon Grocery Limited and at the period
end, there were balances outstanding due from Leon Grocery Limited. All of these amounts were less than
£0.1m individually and in aggregate.

Transactions with the Directors are disclosed in note 7.

**Transactions with key management personnel**
In line with guidance in IAS 24 - Related Party Disclosures, transactions with individuals identified as key
management personnel and outstanding balances with those individuals at the balance sheet date are disclosed
below. As detailed in the Strategic Report, the board of directors of Bellis Topco 2 Limited (“the Topco 2
Board”), together with the Executive Committee, are the key decision-making forums responsible for the
operational management of the Group’s activities and for setting and guiding the strategic direction of the
Group. As such, the directors have determined that transactions and balances with individuals employed by the
Group - for the time period that they held formal roles on either or both of the Topco 2 Board and Executive
Committee - fall within the IAS 24 scope of transactions with key management personnel.

With regard to the prior period, no comparatives have been presented as the governance structures in place as
described above were not embedded prior to 31 December 2021 due to a number of factors including the change
in ownership of ASDA Group Limited on 16 February 2021 and the subsequent Initial Enforcement Order
(“IEO”) issued by the Competition and Markets Authority. Therefore, for the period ending 31 December 2021,
there were no Key Management Personnel with the exception of the Directors of Bellis Finco PLC.

Transactions with key management personnel in the year ended 31 December 2022 and balances outstanding at
the balance sheet date are as follows:

**Year ended 31 December 2022**
**£m**
Short-term employee benefits 7.7
Share-based payments 0.5
Compensation for loss of office 1.0
Total 9.2

Receipts of cash by the Group from key management personnel 3.0
Balances owed to key management personnel at year end 0.6

- Short-term employee benefits consist of salary, cash bonuses and benefits recorded as expenses by the Group
during the year in respect of individuals identified as key management personnel.

Statement in respect of the MIP scheme - further detail is provided in note 21.

- Cash receipts of £3.0m arose during the year due to key management personnel subscribing for management
shares in Bellis Midco 4 Limited under the MIP scheme described in note 21. As this cash is being held by
the Group on behalf of Bellis Midco 4 Limited, it is accounted for as an intercompany payable balance.

- Balances owed to key management personnel at 31 December 2022 consist of employment costs recorded in
the consolidated Income Statement during the year which are outstanding at the balance sheet date.

**29 Ultimate parent company and parent company of larger group**

#### Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC (continued)

**Conclusions relating to going concern**
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors’
assessment of the group and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting
included the following procedures:

- We obtained management’s Going Concern assessment including the cash forecast and forecast covenant
calculation which covers the period to 31 December 2023. The Group has modelled a base scenario and a
severe but plausible downside scenario in their cash forecasts in order to incorporate unexpected changes to
the forecasted liquidity of the Group;

- We tested the assumptions included in each modelled scenario for the cash forecast and covenant calculation
and we have considered the impact of the current geopolitical situation as well as climate change cash
commitments on the going concern assessment performed by the Directors;

- We challenged the appropriateness of the methods used to calculate the cash forecasts and covenant
calculations and determined that they were appropriately sophisticated to be able to make an assessment on
going concern;

- We have performed procedures over the integrity of the modelling, challenged the cash flows included
against external benchmarks and market consensus and the availability of funding included in the
assessment;

- We considered the mitigating factors included in the cash forecasts and covenant calculations that are within
control of the Group and to assess whether that they provide potential further liquidity if required. We also
agreed the credit facilities back to source contracts to validate the credit facilities available to the Group;
and,

- We have performed reverse stress testing in order to identify what factors would lead to the Group utilising
all liquidity or breaching the financial covenant during the going concern period.

We reviewed the company’s going concern disclosures included in the annual report in order to assess that the
disclosures were appropriate and in conformity with the reporting standards.
**Our key observations**
The Group has cash of £505.5m and non-current borrowings of £4,073.2m as at 31 December 2021. We note
that, other than an amount of £9.8m in respect of Term Loan A which is due in February 2023, no further
principal repayments of the borrowings are due during the going concern period. There is significant liquidity
through the cash balance and the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) available to the Group to meet its obligations
as they fall due.

We observe that in management’s base case and downside scenarios, there is significant headroom without
taking the benefit of any identified mitigations.

Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent company’s
ability to continue as a going concern for the period to 31 December 2023.

Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this
statement is not a guarantee as to the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

#### Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC (continued)

**Overview of our audit approach**
_Audit scope_

- We performed an audit of the complete financial information of components.

- The components where we performed full audit procedures accounted for 100% of EBIT, 100% of Revenue
and 100% of Total assets.

_Key audit matters_

- Purchase Price Allocation

- Sale and Leaseback

- Supplier Income

_Materiality_

- Overall group materiality of £34m which represents 5% of adjusted EBIT.

**Involvement with component teams**
All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the Group audit team.

**Tailoring the scope**
Our assessment of audit risk, our evaluation of materiality and our allocation of performance materiality
determine our audit scope for each company within the Group. Taken together, this enables us to form an
opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the
group and effectiveness of group wide controls, changes in the business environment and other factors such as
recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each company.

In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the Group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate
quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the three reporting components of
the Group, we selected three components covering entities within the UK which represent the principal business
units within the Group.

Of the three components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of all
components (“full scope components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics.

The full scope reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% of the Group’s
EBIT 100% of the Group’s Revenue and 100% of the Group’s Total assets.

#### Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC (continued)

**Climate change**
There has been increasing interest from stakeholders as to how climate change will impact Bellis Finco plc. The
Group has considered the most significant future impacts from climate change on their operations and disclosed
these as part of their principal risks and uncertainties on page 21, which form part of the “Other information,”
rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore consisted solely of
considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in
the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated.

As explained in the Basis of Preparation section of Note 1, governmental and societal responses to climate
change risks are still developing, and are interdependent upon each other, and consequently financial statements
cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known.

Our audit effort in considering climate change was focused on ensuring that the effects of material climate risks
disclosed have been appropriately considered in the financial statements. We also challenged the Directors’
considerations of climate change in their assessment of going concern disclosures.

**Key audit matters**
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of
the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters included those which had the
greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of
the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a
whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Purchase Price Allocation**

Refer to Accounting policies (Note 1); and Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Risk_
As of 16 February 2021, Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Ltd acquired the entire share capital of ASDA Group
Limited (AGL) from Walmart Inc for consideration of £6.7bn.

Acquisition accounting requires management judgement in identifying and valuing the assets acquired,
determining at what point control was achieved and identifying appropriate fair value adjustments as part of the
purchase price exercise.

Acquisition accounting involves a high degree of judgement and estimation. There is a risk that the assets
acquired such as the land, buildings, and intangible assets and corresponding goodwill recognised are not valued
appropriately.

_Our response to the risk_
We performed full scope audit procedures over the risk area which covered all the risk amount.

We performed the following procedures:

- We performed a walk through to understand the process management had taken in regards to acquisition
accounting and purchase price allocation;

- We read the sale and purchase agreements to understand the terms of acquisition, including any indemnities
and how these had been accounted for;

- We evaluated management’s judgement that control existed at legal completion as opposed to when the Initial
Enforcement Order ceased. We considered the nature of the IEO, any relief granted during the phase and
whether there was any contrary evidence to determine whether control had not passed as of 16 February 2021;

- We tested the completeness of the assets and liabilities acquired and fair valued as part of the PPA exercise;

- We validated the consideration paid for ASDA Group Limited, from the sales purchase agreement through to
bank statements. We also assessed any pass-through costs (such as share options, pension related costs) and
ensured they had been accounted for appropriately;

- We involved our Valuations specialists to assess and challenge the purchase price allocation (PPA) reports
prepared by management or management’s specialists;

- We challenged management’s cashflow forecast and assumptions including, for example, discount rates,
revenue and EBIT growth, and other key inputs to support the valuation of the intangible assets identified;

- We audited other material fair value adjustments outside of the recognition of intangible assets, including
involving property specialists to assess the fair value of the tangible and property assets; and,

- We evaluated any other significant transactions identified from our review of board minutes, to determine if
they had been treated correctly within the PPA.

We reviewed Board and other papers in connection with the acquisition to support the identification of
intangible assets acquired.

_Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee_
Based on our audit procedures we have concluded that the acquisition accounting undertaken was performed in
accordance with IFRS 3 and not materially misstated.

#### Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC (continued)

**Sale and Leaseback**

Refer to the Accounting policies (Note 1); and Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements.

_Risk_
During the period management entered into a sale and leaseback agreement to sell the depot assets owned by
ASDA Group Limited to Bellis Select Warehouse Limited and then subsequently to Blackstone.

As a result of this transaction a gain of £279.1m was recognised in the income statement of Bellis Finco PLC.

This gain is based on the assets being at fair value and market rents with appropriate yields. Judgement is
required in assessing whether the transaction was at market terms and as such represents the fair values of the
assets.

In addition, due to the material nature of the sale and leaseback gain, the incremental borrowing rate (IBR) used
by management was also a focus area given IBR is inherently judgmental and complex, especially given the
longevity of the lease tenor and the extent of available market data at this tenor.

There is also judgement around the assets identified as being landlord vs tenant assets, to ensure they are
appropriately de-recognised from the balance sheet as a result of the sale and thus the fair value gain is correctly
calculated, and subsequent lease accounting is applied appropriately.

_Our response to the risk_
We performed full scope audit procedures over the risk area which covered all the risk amount.

We performed the following procedures:

- We walked through the process undertaken by the Directors and management in executing the sale and
leaseback transaction;

- We read all key agreements to ensure that the transaction met the criteria to be recognised as a sale under IFRS
15;

- We used our property valuation specialists to assess both the fair value and market rents of the properties;

- We obtained extracts from the fixed assets register and validated that the assets sold were correctly identified
as landlord assets and therefore appropriately de-recognised;

- We recomputed the gain and other related balance sheet amounts to validate the accuracy of the numbers
reported; and,

- We utilised our treasury specialists to support in challenging the IBR determined by management to ensure the
methodology and value applied was in line with the standard.

_Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee_
We concluded that the criteria to recognise the transaction as a sale had been met under IFRS 15.

We concluded that the amounts recorded in relation to the sale and leaseback were materially stated.

**Supplier Income**

Refer to Accounting policies (Note 1 of the Consolidated Financial Statements).

_Risk_
There is a risk of inappropriate cut-off around early or late funding, or false recognition of income due back
from suppliers.

Total supplier income recognised in the period is in the form of Volume agreements and Fixed agreements.

We consider the Fixed agreements to have a higher degree of subjectivity as they are manual in nature and can
be retrospective, compared to the Volume agreements and therefore our risk procedures are focused on these
types of agreements.

_Our response to the risk_
We performed full scope audit procedures over the risk area which covered all the risk amount.

We performed the following procedures:

- We performed a walk through of the process to recognise supplier income and tested key controls within this
process;

- We obtained a download from the supplier income system and using a bespoke analyser performed targeted
analytic procedures to identify unusual items;

- We selected a sample of agreements and performed independent confirmation of the key terms with the
suppliers. Where we did not receive a response we obtained the signed supplier agreement and validated that the
terms had been recorded correctly in the system and the amounts recognised to date were in line with those
terms;

- We performed inquiry with buyers independently to corroborate or identify any contrary evidence to the
explanations we had obtained from finance;

- We performed margin analysis at a department level to identify any unusual trends which could suggest a
change in supplier income terms, or undue pressure on the department. We used this to corroborate our findings
from the analytic tool and to ensure completeness around any unusual items Using data extracted from the
system we analysed the booking pattern for supplier income journals and investigated any material exceptions to
the expected booking pattern. This allowed us to consider the whole population and focus on unusual journal
pairings; and,

- We tested the existence and valuation of balance sheet amounts recognised in accounts receivable by tracing
through to post year end settlement or through contra-asset payments within accounts payables.

_Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee_
Based on our audit procedures we have concluded that the supplier income recognised in the period is
appropriate.

Bellis Finco PLC

31 December 2021
#### Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC (continued)

**Our application of materiality**
We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified
misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion.

_Materiality_
The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a
basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures.

We determined materiality for the Group to be £34 million, which is 5% of adjusted EBIT. We believe that
adjusted EBIT provides us with an appropriate basis for materiality and is the most relevant measure for
stakeholders as profitability is a key measure. EBIT has been adjusted to remove the one-off gain from the sale
and leaseback of £279.1m, the gain on bargain purchase of £2,654.3m (both disclosed as Other Income), one-off
acquisition related expenses of £92.6m and £116.7m relating to additional depreciation as a result of fair value
uplifts on PPE, intangible assets and leases. We have adjusted for these items as we consider them non-recurring
in nature.

We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be £27 million, which is 2% of equity.

During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and determined that no change from our original
assessment at planning was required.

_Performance materiality_
The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an
appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds
materiality.

On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment,
our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% of our planning materiality, namely £25m. We have
set performance materiality at this percentage due to there being no factors present that indicate a higher
likelihood that misstatements may occur within the financial statements based on our history of auditing the
trading group, ASDA Group Limited.

Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial
statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance
materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a
whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current period, the range of
performance materiality allocated to components was £5m to £25m.

_Reporting threshold_
An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of
£2m, which is set at 8% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view,
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed
above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion.

**Other information**
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 2-26, other than
the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information
contained within the annual report.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is
materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material misstatement in the financial statements
themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the
other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

- the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

- the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the Group and the parent company and its environment
obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the Strategic Report or
Directors’ Report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to
report to you if, in our opinion:

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

- certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

**Responsibilities of directors**
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 27, the Directors are
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair
view, and for such internal control as the Directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial
statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s and the parent
company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the group or the
parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

Bellis Finco PLC
Reports and Financial Statements
31 December 2021
#### Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC (continued)

**Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise
from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be
expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
**Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including**
**fraud**
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud
may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through
collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed
below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those
charged with governance of the entity and management.

Our approach was as follows:

- We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and
determined that the most significant frameworks directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial
statements are those that relate to the reporting framework (International Accounting Standards in
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 for the group and United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice for the parent) and the relevant tax laws and regulations in the UK. In
addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations which may have an effect on
the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements being those laws and regulations
relating to health and safety and employee matters.

- We understood how Bellis Finco PLC is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of Group
management, Group Legal & Compliance, and Internal Audit. We corroborated our enquiries through our
review of board minutes and papers and inspection of commentary in the group management accounts.

- We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how
fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it
considered there was a susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity
to influence efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls
that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud;
and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be
higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included
testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were
free from material fraud and error.

- Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws
and regulations. Our procedures involved journal entry testing on the full population of journals, with a focus
on manual consolidation journals, and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our
understanding of the business; enquiries of Group management, Group Legal, Group Ethics & Compliance,
and Internal Audit. In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in
the Group Financial Statements with the requirements of the relevant accounting standards, and UK
legislation.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council’s website at https://www frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of
our auditor’s report.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021

**1** **Accounting policies**

**General information**
The Company is a public company limited by share capital, incorporated and domiciled in England under the
Companies Act 2006 (registration number 12855336).

The address of its registered office is:
Waterside Head Office
Haslingden Road
Guide
Blackburn
Lancashire
BB1 2FA
UK

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as
"the Group").

These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board on 12 May 2022.

**Statement of compliance**
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

**Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates**
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below.

**Basis of preparation**
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in
conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's
accounting policies.

The Company was incorporated on 3 September 2020 and as a result no comparative information has been
provided.

The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundreds of
thousands of pounds (£0.1m) except where otherwise stated.

As described in the Strategic Report, the main activities of the Group are the retailing of food, clothing, general
merchandise products, fuel and services throughout the United Kingdom and online.
In preparing the Group’s Consolidated Financial statements management has considered the impact of climate
change for the purposes of the going concern assessment, and the disclosures included in the Strategic report.
This assessment did not identify any material risks arising from climate change, accordingly there has been no
material impact on the cashflow forecasts used to assess the going concern basis. Furthermore, our forecasts for
going concern do not include any material profitability impact in relation to climate change. The Group will
keep this assessment under review and continue to monitor developments in the future.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Going concern**
The financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2021 have been prepared on the going concern basis
as the Directors have determined that the Group has sufficient resources and liquidity facilities to meet its
liabilities as they fall due for the period from the date of approval of the accounts up to 31 December 2023.

In assessing the Group’s ability to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have tested the ability of the
Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due from the date of approval of the accounts up to 31 December 2023,
in the event of various cash flow scenarios, including a severe but plausible downside scenario. This scenario
applies severe but plausible economic downsides to our base case forecast, modelling the impact of a decline of
the Group’s participation in the UK grocery market alongside the risk of continued food inflation. Furthermore,
the Directors have considered the likely impacts on the business of increased levels of political instability and
uncertainty arising out of external events which have occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date and are
ongoing at the date of approval of the financial statements. The Directors are satisfied that the potential
economic impacts of these events are adequately taken into account in the severe but plausible downside
scenario.

Mitigating actions that are in the control of management have been considered such as reducing non-essential
capital expenditure and discretionary spend.

The model has been reverse stress tested to determine the extent of deterioration of cash flows that would lead to
the Group breaching the level of available facilities. The Directors consider that such a significant deterioration
of cash flows is implausible.

At the date of approval of the accounts, the Directors are satisfied that in the event of the severe but plausible
downside scenario occurring, the Group would meet its liabilities as they fall due up to 31 December 2023.

**Changes in accounting policy**
None of the standards, interpretations and amendments effective for the first time from 3 September 2020 have
had a material impact on the financial statements.

**New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective**
There are no issued but not yet effective standards, interpretations and amendments, which have not been
applied in these financial statements, that will or may have a material impact on the Group financial statements
in future.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Judgements, estimates and assumptions**
Management are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies
and reported assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually
evaluated and are based on historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future
events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The key judgements, estimates and assumptions impacting the carrying value of assets and liabilities are
discussed further below.

_Judgements_
_IFRS 16 lease term_
IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the period covered by
options to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option, and the period covered by an
option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise the option. The Group applies
judgement to whether an extension should be added to the non-cancellable lease term with reference to the
following:

- Extension options in the contract. Consideration as to whether any option is reasonably certain to be
exercised is based on whether an economic incentive exists to do so. This incentive is assessed by reference
to multiple factors including but not limited to current operational performance of the site and future
performance projections, length of time to the option exercise date and future capital requirements. The
majority of the Group's leases do not have extension options in the contract but, where they do, most lease
terms include the extension period.

- Geographical factors. A term extension on any lease for sites in England and Wales may be judged
reasonably certain on the basis of security of tenure if an economic incentive to remain in the lease beyond
the contractual term is deemed to exist. This incentive is assessed by reference to the same factors listed
above. If an extension is judged reasonably certain, the typical additional term applied is 10 years.
Geographical factors are not considered for sites outside England and Wales.

In the event of changing circumstances or new information that may impact judgements taken, lease terms will
be re-assessed on a lease by lease basis. A quarterly review is performed to identify where re-assessments may
be required. Any change in lease term could result in a recalculation of the lease liability and a material
adjustment to the associated right-of-use asset. There are no examples of term reassessment in the period.

_IFRS 16 discount rate_

IFRS 16 requires that lease liabilities are discounted at the interest rate implicit in a lease, or where this isn’t
available, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The majority of the Group’s leases do not include an interest
rate implicit in the lease, and therefore the incremental borrowing rate is utilised to discount these leases.

The incremental borrowing rate is considered a key judgement and under IFRS 16 reflects the rate of interest a
lessee would have to borrow over a similar term, with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of
a similar value in a similar economic environment.

We consider the following factors in determining the incremental borrowing rate:

- The risk free rate of return in the UK market; and,

- The credit risk spread which reflects the additional risks associated with lending specifically to the Group,
taking account of factors such as our credit rating, the term of the lease, and the geographic location.

The risk free rate is observable in the market and is the base of our calculation, however there is significant
judgement in determining the additional credit risk spread specific to the Group on the basis that there is limited
market observable data on which to make this judgement, particularly for lease terms in excess of 10 years. As a
result we utilise rates from other geographical regions (e.g. US) for companies with a similar credit rating where
there is more market observable data on which to base our judgement. The geographical locations utilised,
alongside the specific data selected for inclusion are considered a key judgement.

Due to the extent of the Group’s lease portfolio, small changes in discount rate can significantly impact the
accounting recognition and could result in a material difference to the right-of-use asset, lease liability, and
associated depreciation and interest charge recognised in the Income Statement.

Further, the Group has leases for a wide range of different terms, from 1 year to in excess of 100 years.
Judgement is used by the Group to apply a cap of 30 years to the discount rate on the basis that data relating to
loans for terms in excess of 30 years is rare and as such, no more reliable rate than a 30 year rate can be
determined.

The Group also applies judgement in determining the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis.
Management have asserted that by updating the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis, we ensure that
the discount rate used remains relevant, current and materially correct. Should events and conditions change in
the interim period we would consider whether the discount rate should be updated on a more frequent basis.

_Supply Chain Finance_

Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be
classified as trade payables or as another line item on the Balance Sheet. In determining the classification, the
Group reviews each arrangement against a number of characteristics to assess whether the substance of
liabilities owed by the Group to the participating banks under the contractual terms of the arrangements is
consistent with other trade payables. These include:

- Whether participation in the schemes is voluntary for suppliers;

- Whether the Group is involved in the negotiations and agreements between the banks and suppliers or
tri-partite agreements exist;

- Whether payment terms have been extended outside industry norms for trade payables;

- Whether interest is accrued on outstanding balances or fees are receivable by the Group;

- Whether the banks require parent guarantees in respect of the Group’s obligations;

- Whether the Group retains its rights to offset credits or withhold payment.

The nature of the Group’s liabilities under supply chain financing arrangements when considering these
characteristics supports classification of amounts owed by the Group under its supply chain financing
arrangements as trade payables.

_Pension buy-in_

Prior to the buy-out of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme (“the AGPS” or “the Scheme”) during the period, the
Group retained an obligation to fund pension liabilities of the Scheme in the event of insurer default. As such,
the buy-in did not meet the criteria of a settlement event as set out in IAS 19 - Employee Benefits and therefore,
prior to the buy-out on 9 July 2021, actuarial gains and losses associated with the buy-in which arose prior to the
buy-out have been recognised in other comprehensive income during the period. Further detail is provided in
note 20.

_Pension buy-out_

On 9 July 2021, the trustees of the AGPS completed a buy-out of the Scheme whereby an insurer, Rothesay
Life, have become fully and directly responsible for the pension obligations of the Scheme. In the Directors’
opinion, this meets the definition of a settlement event per requirements of IAS 19 as the completion of the
buy-out represents absolute extinguishment of the Scheme’s risk of exposure to pension liabilities and therefore
also represents absolute extinguishment of the Group’s obligations as sponsoring employer to fund the liabilities
of the AGPS. As such, other than £0.5m of assets and liabilities which were outside the scope of the buy-out, the
Group has de-recognised all AGPS assets and liabilities during the period. Further details of the resultant impact
of the buy-out on other comprehensive income and operating expenses are provided in note 20.

_Litigation_

Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance
with IAS 37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters
are made in contingent liabilities (note 26).

_Business combinations - acquisition date_

On 16 February 2021, Mohsin and Zuber Issa, founders and co-CEOs of EG Group, a global convenience and
forecourts retailer, headquartered in Blackburn, UK, and investment funds managed by TDR Capital LLP
(“TDR Capital”), a leading UK-based private equity firm, together acquired ASDA Group Limited (“ASDA”).

Under the new ownership structure, Mohsin and Zuber Issa and TDR Capital indirectly own 100% of the
ordinary shares in Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited (“BAC3”) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the
Company, which in turn acquired the entire issued share capital of ASDA.

On 10 February 2021, the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order
(IEO) under section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Zuber Issa, Mohsin Issa, TDR Capital LLP and ASDA
in relation to the acquisition by BAC3 of ASDA. The IEO commenced on 16 February 2021, the day transaction
legally completed and was lifted on 16 June 2021.

In determining the acquisition date, for the purposes of applying IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the Directors
have considered whether the IEO restrictions prevented BAC3 from controlling ASDA. In making this
judgement the Directors considered BAC3’s ability to direct the relevant activities of ASDA that could impact
its return during the IEO period. The Directors concluded that control transferred on 16 February 2021, as there
was sufficient evidence of BAC3’s ability to direct ASDA from this date. The IEO was subsequently lifted on
16 June 2021. As a result, ASDA Group Limited and its subsidiaries are consolidated in these financial
statements from 16 February 2021.

_Estimates_
_Insurance_

The insurance provision (note 21) relates to liabilities arising from past events which are not covered by third
party insurance. This includes both known and potential claims from stores and depots. Estimates are made with
regards to determining the provision required either by actuarial assessment or based on historical experience.

_Deferred gain relating to sale-and-leaseback transaction_

The Group estimates the gain on sale to be recognised in the Income Statement based on the amount of the gain
that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The remaining gain is deferred as a reduction to the
right-of-use asset relating to the leaseback. This estimate requires determining the fair value of the properties
transferred and calculating the lease liability of the leaseback. As noted in the ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’ section
above, there is inherent judgement included in the determination of the appropriate discount rate. The fair value
of properties transferred is determined using third party valuation specialists. Please see further detail on
financial amounts in note 9.

**Basis of consolidation**
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the Income Statement from
the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary,
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with
those used by the Group.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its
subsidiaries, which are related parties, are eliminated in full.

#### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Business combinations and goodwill**
Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition
date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of
non-controlling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets
is determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in
operating costs. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for
appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the
consideration transferred and any amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the fair value of
identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the
contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities
representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably.

If the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and any amount recognised for
the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the
difference represents a gain on bargain purchase (negative goodwill) and is recognised in the Consolidated
Income Statement as other income.

The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured at acquisition date fair
value in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ with the exception of income taxes, employee
benefits, reimbursement assets, reacquired rights, share-based payments and assets held-for-sale.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose
of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to
each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of
whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit, or group of units, to
which goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored
for internal management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the
goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when
determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured
based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

**Foreign currency**
The presentational currency of the Group is Sterling. The primary functional currency of the parent and
subsidiary companies is also Sterling.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement,
except when hedge accounting is applied and differences are recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the spot rate ruling at the Balance Sheet date.
The income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate
approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.

Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive
income. They are released into the Consolidated Income Statement upon disposal.

**Intangible assets**
Intangible assets acquired are carried initially at cost. Following initial recognition, the historic cost model is
applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment
losses.

Intangible assets include software costs, brand licenses and customer relationships. Software costs capitalised
consist of both costs from third parties and costs of internal resources involved in development activities. When
considering whether software costs can be capitalised, the Directors perform an assessment of whether the
Group controls the underlying asset. Factors considered when assessing whether the Group controls an asset
include where and how the software is hosted and the ability the Group has to make changes to the software.

Costs are only capitalised once a project is in the development stage and approval for the project as a whole to
be completed has been obtained. Costs incurred in the research stage are expensed as incurred.

In relation to Software as a Service (“SAAS”) contracts, where it cannot be demonstrated that the Group
controls the underlying assets development, costs incurred are immediately recognised as an expense in the
Consolidated Income Statement other than software licence fees which are included in prepaid expenses and
amortised over the period of the respective licence. The factors noted above in relation to how the software is
hosted and whether the Group has the ability to make or direct changes directly to the underlying software as
part of the SAAS contract are considered as part of this assessment.

Where implementation costs are incurred as part of a SAAS contract, these development costs are separately
considered to identify whether they represent an intangible asset in their own right as detailed above. If the
Directors conclude that the implementation costs do not meet the recognition criteria of a separate intangible
asset, an assessment is then made as to whether the costs represent configuration of the software product or
customisation. If configuration, these costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred,
whereas if customisation the Directors will assess whether these costs can be prepaid over the term of the SAAS
contract as they cannot be separated from the software product itself.

Costs associated with interim software solutions which do not meet the Group’s policy of a 3 year minimum
useful economic life are expensed as incurred.

Brand licences are capitalised when acquired as part of a business combination if they are separable or arise
from contractual or other legal rights. A brand licence is initially measured at fair value using an appropriate
valuation methodology (e.g. relief-from-royalty approach). Brand licences are not amortised where they have an
indefinite useful life. Costs in relation to internally generated brands are not capitalised.

Customer relationships are capitalised when acquired as part of a business combination if they are separable or
arise from contractual or other legal rights. A customer relationship is initially measured at fair value using an
appropriate valuation methodology (e.g. multi-period excess earnings method). Customer relationships are
amortised over their useful economic life of 10 years.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Amortisation**
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their
expected useful lives, with charges included in operating costs, as follows:

Software and development costs 4 years
Contractual customer relationships 10 years

The purchased goodwill of the Group and brand licence intangibles are regarded as having an indefinite useful
economic life and in accordance with IAS 38, are not amortised but are subject to annual tests for impairment.

**Property, plant and equipment**
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

For assets acquired by the Group through a business combination, the deemed cost is the fair value at the date of
acquisition by the Group.

Items of property, plant and equipment under construction are valued at cost and not depreciated. Depreciation
is charged from the date that the assets are available for use.

All property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 ‘Impairment of
Assets’.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits
are expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the
asset is included in the Income Statement.

**Depreciation**
Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as
follows:

Freehold properties 20 - 50 years
Leasehold improvements Shorter of 20 - 50 years or the lease term
Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings 3 - 20 years

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Impairment of non-financial assets**
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is
estimated. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested annually for impairment regardless of whether
any indicators for impairment exist.

An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent
from those of other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time-value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment
losses on continuing operations are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement in those expense
categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units (“CGU”) are allocated first to reduce the
carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and second, to reduce the carrying amount of the other
assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

**Assets held for sale**
The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that
it is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn.
Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one
year from the date of the classification.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for
sale. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

**Provisions**
A provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as
a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the
obligation, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect is material,
provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time-value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

**Leases**

**_The Group as a lessee_**

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. The Group recognises a
right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the
lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). For these leases,
the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the
lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from
the leased assets are consumed.

_Lease liability_

The lease liability is initially measured at the value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement
date, discounted to present value.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

- Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

- Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

- The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

- The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and,

- Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to
terminate the lease.

Lease liabilities are presented as separate current and non-current amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liability (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease
payments made.

The Group re-measures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use
asset) whenever:

- The lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in
the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is re-measured by
discounting the revised lease payments using the current discount rate;

- The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using an unchanged discount rate; or,

- A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case
the lease liability is re-measured based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised
lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

_Discount rate_

When discounting payments to present value, the Group uses the interest rate implicit in the lease if this rate can
be readily determined. For a small volume of high value leases, the rate implicit in the lease can be calculated
and has therefore been used.

Otherwise, for the majority of leases the rate used is based on an estimated incremental borrowing rate. Further
detail on the calculation of the incremental borrowing rate is detailed in the ‘Key judgements’ section of this
note under the heading ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’.

_Right-of-use Assets_

Right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made
at or before the commencement day (including lease buy out payments made to previous tenants) less any lease
incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term. If the lease includes an option to transfer ownership of
the underlying asset, or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase
option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. Depreciation is
charged from the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified
impairment loss as described in the ‘Impairment of non-financial assets' policy above.

_Non-lease components and variable rent expense_

As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for
any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has taken this election with
the exception of IT and printer leases where other charges included in the contract (maintenance and
replenishment) are accounted for separately within related cost lines.

The primary non-lease components recognised within lease payments are property costs (service charges and
insurances) paid to landlords and included within the terms of lease contracts. These costs are included within
the lease payments at commencement date if fixed, or within variable rent expense as incurred if not. The
majority of these payments are variable and therefore not included in the lease liability.

As a lessee, the Group does not have any rent payment terms linked to sales or other variable metrics.

**_The Group as a lessor_**

The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to a small amount of its excess property and
space inside operational stores. Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating
leases. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the
lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the head lease and sub-lease are accounted for as two separate
contracts and assessment of classification is made with reference to the right-of-use asset resulting from the
head lease rather than the underlying asset. The Group currently has no leases classified as finance where it is
the lessor.

Where the Group owns the freehold, assets are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over
their useful economic lives. Rental income from operating leases, including the effect of lease incentives, is
recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Third party lessees are subject to credit checks prior to entering into a lease contract with the Group and may be
required to provide a guarantor depending on the outcome of these checks. Additionally, some leases contain
clauses enabling upwards revision of the rental charge according to prevailing market condition at points within
the lease contracts.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Financial instruments**
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.

_Financial assets and liabilities_
The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities in the following categories: non-interest-bearing financial
assets, interest bearing receivables, derivatives designated as hedging instruments, cash and cash equivalents,
non-interest-bearing financial liabilities and interest-bearing borrowings. The Group's accounting policies
relating to lease liabilities are described above.

Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.

All financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. The Group assesses financial assets for
impairment using the expected credit losses model and recognises impairment losses as required.

_Non-interest-bearing financial assets and interest-bearing receivables_
These categories include trade and other receivables and intercompany receivables which are held with the sole
objective of collecting contractual cash flows and are therefore carried at amortised cost. They are included in
current assets except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date.

_Derivatives designated as hedging instruments_
Derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign
currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations.

Derivatives are stated at their fair value. The fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts is their market
value at the Balance Sheet date. Market values are calculated using mathematical models and are based on the
duration of derivative together with quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and
market volatility at the Balance Sheet date. The fair value of cross-currency interest rate swaps is measured
using a swap valuation model, this model incorporates various observable market inputs including the credit
quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies,
currency basis spreads between the respective currencies and interest rate curves.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship
is formally designated and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management
objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will
be measured throughout its duration.

All of the Group’s hedges are considered to be cash flow hedges, hedging exposure to variability in cash flows
that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable
forecast transaction. The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk in
forecast transactions and firm commitments (refer to note 18 for further details). In addition, the Group uses
cross-currency-interest-rate swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk and floating interest rate risk
relating to its foreign currency borrowings.

For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in
other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
For hedges of foreign currency purchases the gain or loss is recognised within cost of inventories. For
Cross-currency-interest-rate-swaps, the gain or loss is recognised in finance costs or finance income. Amounts
recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction
affects profit or loss.

If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated Income Statement. If the hedging instrument expires
or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked,
amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the
forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the Income Statement.

_Non-interest-bearing financial liabilities_
The Group’s non-interest-bearing financial liabilities, include trade and other payables, and intercompany
payables, which are recognised at amortised cost.

_Interest-bearing borrowings_
The Group’ interest-bearing borrowings include intercompany borrowings and external borrowings and are
recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or losses arising on repurchase, settlement or
cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income or finance cost. Borrowings are
classified as current liabilities except for those with contractual maturities greater than 12 months after the
Balance Sheet date.

_Offsetting of financial instruments_
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet only when there is a
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or
realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

_Fair values_
Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent
arm’s length transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same,
discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

**1** **Accounting policies (continued)**

**Inventories**
Inventories comprise goods for resale and goods not for resale and are stated at the lower of cost and net
realisable value.

Goods at warehouses are valued at weighted average cost. Expenditure incurred in acquiring the goods and
bringing them to their existing location and condition (including applicable supplier income) are included in
inventories. Inventories at retail outlets are valued at average cost prices. Goods not for resale primarily
comprise fuel and are valued on a first in, first out basis.
**Taxation**
The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement,
except that a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is
also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income for the period, using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date.

Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes except:

- the initial recognition of goodwill or of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit
other than in a business combination;

- in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences
will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and,

- deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the asset can be utilised.

The amount of deferred tax provided is measured on an undiscounted basis based on the expected manner of
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the Balance Sheet date.

In line with the requirements of IAS 12 - Income Taxes, provisions will be recognised for uncertain tax
positions where a risk of an additional tax liability is identified and it is probable that the Group will be required
to settle that tax. This will be measured based on management’s expectation of the outcome of decisions by the
relevant tax authority, assessed on a case-by-case basis using in-house tax experts, professional firms and
previous experience.

**Trade and other receivables**
Trade and other receivables are stated at their original invoiced value (discounted if material) as reduced by
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are
assessed as uncollectible.

**Cash and cash equivalents**
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, credit and debit card receivables and short-term deposits
with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts and other credit facilities that are repayable on
demand, to the extent that they are used, are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the
purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

**Trade and other payables**
Trade and other payables, other than intercompany loans, are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal
value.

**Borrowing costs**
Borrowing costs are recognised in the Group’s Income Statement except for costs that are directly attributable to
the construction of buildings which are capitalised and included within the initial cost of a building.
Capitalisation of borrowing costs ceases when the property is ready for use. The interest rate applied is based on
the average rate of general borrowings outstanding during a period.

**Defined contribution pension plans**
Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an operating expense in the
Income Statement as incurred.

**Defined benefit pension assets and liabilities**
The Group’s net asset or liability in respect of its defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in prior periods; that benefit is
discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The calculation is
performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The financing costs of the scheme are
recognised in the period in which they arise.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income in the period
in which they occur.

As described in note 20, a buy-out of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme (“AGPS”) was executed during the
period on 9 July 2021. As such, the assets and liabilities of the AGPS, other than assets and liabilities amounting
to £0.5m for which the Group remains the sponsoring employer, have been de-recognised as pension assets and
liabilities. In accordance with the requirements of IAS 19, the settlement loss arising from the de-recognition of
pension assets and liabilities at buyout has been recorded as a loss in the Income Statement.

**Dividend distributions**
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders.

**Revenue recognition**
Revenue represents sales to customers through retail outlets and online, excluding value added tax. Revenue is
recognised net of intercompany transactions, staff discounts, coupons and the free element of multi-save
transactions.

_Income from concessions and commissions_
Income from concessions and commissions is based on the terms of the contract and is included within rental
income and other income.

_Interest and dividend income_
Interest income is recognised in the Income Statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Dividend income is recognised in the Company's profit on the date the Company’s right to receive payments is
established.

**Supplier income**
Supplier incentives, rebates, fixed income and discounts (collectively known as “supplier income”) are
recognised, as a deduction from cost of inventories recognised as an expense, as they accrue in accordance with
the terms of each relevant supplier agreement. All supplier income is supported by agreements and, in the
majority of instances, these agreements begin and end within the Group’s financial period. In a small number of
instances, contractual periods may extend over the Group’s period end. In such cases the amount of any income
accrued in relation to these agreements is supported by detailed calculations.

Supplier income is split into three classifications:

- Supplier incentives and discounts - which are usually expressed in the supplier agreement as an agreed
amount per item sold. This type of supplier income is mechanically calculated and therefore no judgement is
required in determining the amount of income to record in the financial period;

- Annual supplier rebates - these are earned and billed within the Group’s financial period in the majority of
cases. The rebates are linked to pre-agreed volumes of sales or purchases of specific products and are
supported by explicit contractual terms; and,

- Fixed amount supplier income - this is earned and billed within the Group’s financial period in the majority
of cases. Fixed monetary amounts are agreed with suppliers relating to certain promotional activities
including, for example, new product listings, increased product distribution or specific promotional events.

Unbilled amounts of income to which the Group is contractually entitled are included in trade and other
receivables, or offset against corresponding trade payables, however these amounts are not considered material.
Billed amounts unpaid at the period-end are included in trade receivables or offset against corresponding trade
payables where a contractual right of offset exists.

Supplier income recognised in the Income Statement and accounted for within trade receivables (note 15) at the
period-end for which estimation and judgement is required is £0.8m. This represents the net amount of accrued
income of £0.8m and deferred income of £nil on deals running across the period-end.

**Share-based payments**
For all liabilities arising from share-based payment arrangements the Group has applied IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based
Payments’. All share-based payment liabilities have been settled during the period.

The share option programmes allowed Group employees to acquire shares of the former ultimate parent
company, Walmart Inc.; these awards were granted by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The fair value
of options granted was initially measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees
became unconditionally entitled to payment. The charge was recognised as an employee expense, with a
corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value of the share option is measured based on an option valuation
model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The liability was
re-measured at each Balance Sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value were recognised in
the Income Statement during the vesting period. These share based payment transactions were accounted for as
cash-settled.

**Reimbursement assets**
Where it is virtually certain that the Group will be reimbursed by a third party for part or all of the expenditure
required to settle a provision then it recognises the reimbursement as a separate reimbursement asset. The
amount recognised for the reimbursement is based on the amount that the Group is expected to be reimbursed
limited to the amount of the provision recognised. In the Consolidated Income Statement, the expense relating to
the provision is presented net of the amount recognised for a reimbursement.

**Contingent liabilities**
The Group may, from time to time, be subject to legal proceedings. Where a liability is not probable or the
amount cannot be reasonably estimated a liability is not recognised. However, where a loss is not considered
probable but a liability is possible and may be material, such matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities.

**2** **Business Combinations**

On 16 February 2021, Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco PLC,
acquired 100% of the entire issued share capital of ASDA Group Limited (ASDA) from ASDA Holdings UK
Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Walmart Inc. (Walmart) for an enterprise value of £6,725.8m. The
acquisition will support and accelerate ASDA's existing strategy benefiting from fresh expertise. ASDA Group
Limited and its subsidiaries are consolidated within the Group from this date.

The agreed consideration transferred was £6,725.8m. This comprises cash consideration of £6,568.3m payable
on or after 16 February 2021 and £157.5m which was settled by ASDA on behalf of Bellis Acquisition
Company 3 Limited prior to 16 February 2021.

Included within the £6,568.3m is £6,518.0m which was settled during the period and £50.3m which is
outstanding at the balance sheet date and is included in trade and other payables.

**2** **Business Combinations (continued)**

The fair value of acquired receivables is materially equal to the contractual amounts receivable.

The acquisition has resulted in a gain on bargain purchase being recognised as Other Income in the consolidated
income statement of £2,654.3m for the period ending 31 December 2021. The gain on bargain purchase arises as
a result of the valuation basis applied to individual assets in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
differing from the basis on which the purchase price was determined - notably the property valuations included
in the net assets acquired being determined on a rental yield basis compared to the purchase price being
determined based on a multiple of EBITDA. In addition, further details on internally generated intangibles,
including the ASDA and George brand licences and customer relationships, that have been capitalised are
included in note 13.

Costs directly relating to completion of the business combinations in the period of £92.6m have been included in
operating costs in the consolidated Income Statement. These acquisition-related costs include stamp duty and
advisory fees in respect of legal, accounting, property valuation and other professional matters.

For the period ended 31 December 2021, ASDA contributed revenue of £20,710.4m and profit before tax of
£963.9m to the Group’s results. If the acquisition had occurred on 3 September 2020, management estimates
that consolidated revenue would have been £31,378.7m, and consolidated profit before tax for the period would
have been £3,145.1m. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments,
that arose on the date of acquisition would have been materially the same if the acquisition had occurred on 3
September 2020.

**3** **Segment reporting**

The Group is engaged in a single reportable operating segment of business, being the retailing of food, clothing,
general merchandise, fuel and services in a single geographical segment, the United Kingdom and online. The
Group is not reliant on any individual major customers.

In line with the Group’s reporting framework and management structure, key operating decisions are made by
the Executive Committee of ASDA Group Limited which is considered to be the Chief Operating Decision
Maker for the Group. All significant revenue is generated by the sale of goods through retail outlets in the UK
and through the Group's online channels. The operations of all product areas of the business are subject to
similar economic characteristics and are sold in a similar retail environment.

The Group has taken these factors into account together with the core principles of IFRS 8 in determining that it
has a single reportable operating segment.

The analysis of the Group's revenue for the period from continuing operations is as follows:

**Period ended**
**31 December**

**9** **Sale-and-Leaseback transaction**

On 23 June 2021, the Group entered into the sale-and-leaseback of twenty-five of its distribution properties.
Further sale-and-leasebacks for two depots were completed on 24 June 2021 and 14 October 2021 respectively.
The properties were sold at fair value to a related party, Bellis Select Warehouse Limited (BSWL), prior to
disposal to a third party.

In accordance with IFRS 15, it was determined that the transfer of the distribution properties to BSWL for
proceeds of £1,675.0m is considered a sale. In the period ended 31 December 2021, assets relating to the
distribution properties with a Net Book Value of £831.3m were sold to BSWL and the Group has recognised a
gain on sale of £279.1m representing the amount of the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the
buyer-lessor. The remaining gain of £564.6m is deferred as a reduction to the right-of-use asset relating to the
leaseback.

On 13 July, 22 July and 21 October 2021, the distribution properties that were transferred to Bellis Select
Warehouse Limited were sold for £1,675.0m to third party entities controlled by Blackstone Group Inc. These
properties were leased back to the Group on terms ranging from 18 months to 35 years (including the
assumption that leases will be extended by 10 years, consistent with the assumptions set out in note 1). The
Group continues to lease these properties from entities controlled by Blackstone Group Inc. and has adjusted the
right of use assets and lease liabilities to reflect amended terms of the leases on transfer to the third-party entities
at that date.

The leasebacks of the depots, taking into account the deferral of a proportion of the disposal gain into the
right-of-use asset and subsequent modification to the lease term, resulted in an increase in right-of-use assets of
£624.9m and lease liabilities of £1,177.4m.

Total tax charge

The standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom for the period is 19%.

On 3 March 2021, it was announced in the UK Budget that the main rate of corporation tax in the United
Kingdom will increase to 25% on 1 April 2023, and this rate change was substantively enacted in May 2021.
The deferred tax liability is calculated using the tax rate at which it is expected to unwind (of between 19% and
25%, this was previously 19%). The tax charge in relation to the rate change is £280.9m.

(a) The tax credit in relation to the sale-and-leaseback of the Group’s distribution properties is £74.2m. A tax
credit arises on the transaction, despite an accounting gain of £279.1m. The chargeable gain on disposal (after
the offset of capital losses) is £74.0m, of which £65.2m has been recognised in the period. However, a deferred
tax asset of £139.4m has arisen where the accounting gain on the disposal of fixed assets has been deferred as a
reduction of the right-of-use asset of the leaseback, as the full proceeds have been taxed as a capital gain.

The Group leases various offices, stores, warehouses, vehicles and equipment under agreements within the
scope of IFRS 16.

Leases of land and buildings have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights, however they commonly
include either a market rent review or index linked rent review with a cap and collar. The timing of when rent
reviews take place differs for each lease. They have no purchase options. The average remaining lease term is
32 years. No property right-of-use assets were impaired in the period.

Leases of plant, vehicles and equipment have various terms but typically do not include mid-term rent reviews
or extension options. They have no purchase options. The average remaining lease term is 4 years.

Included within additions of £742.0m is £624.9m relating to the sale and leaseback transaction. This is stated net
of a £564.6m deferral of the gain on sale. The remaining additions relate to renewals or modifications of
previously existing leases for land and buildings, new leases for plant, vehicles and equipment, alongside
modifications to the lease term on the sale and leaseback properties.

**_George brand licence_**
This asset relates to the acquisition in 2021 of a perpetual licence to use the George brand in the UK and

December 2021 by assessing the present value of forecasted cash flows arising from the George clothing
business.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from
financial budgets approved by senior management covering a five-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied
to the cash flow projections is 8.0% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond specific
forecast period is (0.4)%.

Based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis undertaken, management believe that no reasonably
possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be lower than the
carrying value of the George brand.

Trade receivables are non interest-bearing and are generally on 30 day terms. Trade receivable balances have
been assessed to determine the value of expected credit losses ("ECLs") using the simplified approach in IFRS
9.

Trade receivables are presented net where a legally enforceable right of set off exists. Included in the above is an
offset of £210.2m (note 17) . The trade receivable prior to the offset is £286.5m.

Other receivable balances have been assessed to determine the value of ECLs as per the requirements of IFRS 9
and the impact is £nil.

The Group considers its trade and other receivables in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due.
However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a trade or other receivable to be in default when internal
or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full
before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A trade or other receivable is written off
to the Income Statement when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

The non-current intercompany receivable balance of £1,722.0m is largely due to the intercompany receivables
arising out of the sale-and-leaseback transaction, as properties owned by the Group were sold to a fellow
wholly-owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent undertaking in exchange for an intercompany receivable.

**_Movements in liabilities arising from financing activities_**
External borrowings comprise the financing drawn down to fund the acquisition of ASDA Group Limited (see
note 2). Further details of external borrowings are disclosed in note 19.

On 16 February 2021, the Group entered into two Revolving Credit Facilities (RCF) totalling £690.0m with
£190.0m maturing in February 2022 and £500.0m maturing in July 2025. Fees paid relating to the RCFs of
£10.5m have been capitalised and will be expensed over the term of the facilities. Amortisation of £3.3m was
charged in the period. The carrying amount of RCF fees at 31 December 2021 was £7.2m. On 16 September
2021, the Group voluntarily cancelled the £190.0m RCF. The Group retains the availability of the £500.0m
RCF.

On 26 July 2021, the Group entered into a framework agreement in respect of a short-term working capital
facility in an aggregate amount of £115.0m. The facility provides the Group with a credit facility pursuant to
which payment to the relevant beneficiaries and suppliers is made by ASDA Stores Limited using the facility on
the relevant invoice due date, with ASDA Stores Limited then settling these liabilities in the normal course of
business. An amount of £15.7m is outstanding on this facility at 31 December 2021 and is included in other
payables.

On 5 November 2021, the Group repaid the £750.0m Forecourt Asset Disposal Bridge Facility including
accrued interest through the issuance of £500.0m 4.5% Senior Secured Notes due in February 2026 and cash on
hand of £255.4m.

Total lease cash outflow in the period was £246.5m. This has been presented in financing activities in the cash
flow statement and breaks down as cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability £123.2m and
cash payments for the interest portion of the lease liability of £102.3m. £21.0m has been included in operating
activities in the cash flow statement and relates to short term and variable lease expenses.

**_Security pledged_**
The Group pledged certain assets as security for the indebtedness of parent undertakings in the form of a
first-ranking charge over certain material bank accounts, material intercompany receivables, the shares owned
by the Group in ASDA Stores Limited, McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood House Group Limited,
and a first-ranking floating charge over all present and future assets (other than customarily excluded assets) of
ASDA Group Limited, ASDA Stores Limited, McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood House Group
Limited.

Part of the security pledged is in relation to one of the Group’s existing supply chain finance agreements in the
form of fixed and floating charges over certain of the Group’s assets. There were no other changes to the terms
of this supply chain finance agreement which impact on the nature of amounts owed to the bank under this
arrangement. Given consideration of this and the other factors set out in note 1, the Directors have concluded
that the substance of the Group’s liabilities under this supply chain financing agreement remain consistent
overall with that of a trade payable and accordingly will continue to be accounted for and classified as trade
payables.

On 13 August 2021, the Group entities that guarantee the Senior Secured Notes issued by Bellis Acquisition
Company PLC, the Term Loan Facilities and the Forecourt Bridge Facility borrowed by Bellis Acquisition
Company PLC and the Revolving Credit Facility made available to the Group granted first-priority security
interests over their Material Real Property to secure their obligations under those instruments. With the
completion of this security grant, the Group has discharged the requirement to deliver post-closing collateral
under the various financing arrangements established in connection with the acquisition of ASDA by the Group.
Upon the issuance of additional Senior Secured Notes on 5 November 2021 by Bellis Acquisition Company
PLC, the Group is required to grant further first-priority security interests over their Material Real Property to
secure their obligations under these instruments. This grant of this security was completed on 5 May 2022.

**18 Financial instruments (continued)**

**_Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities_**
The Group’s principal financial instruments during the period comprised cash, cash equivalents, external
borrowings, intercompany payables and receivables, derivatives classified as hedges and lease liabilities. Other
financial assets and liabilities, such as trade receivables, other receivables, trade payables, other payables, and
accruals arise directly from the Group’s operating activities. Set out in the table below is a comparison, by class,
of the carrying amounts and fair values of the Group’s financial instruments. This table excludes trade
receivables, other receivables, trade payables, other payables, accruals, intercompany receivables, intercompany
payables and lease liabilities as the carrying value reasonably approximates the fair value of these financial
instruments. Derivative instruments are also excluded as the carrying value equals fair value at the period end.

**Period ended 31 December 2021**
**Carrying Value** **Fair Value**
**£ m** **£ m**
**Non-current interest-bearing borrowings**
External borrowings 4,073.2 3,949.7

The Group measures the fair value of its financial instruments by reference to the fair value hierarchy in IFRS
13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’:

- Level 1 - using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;

- Level 2 - using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly; and

- Level 3 - using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable
inputs).

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial
instruments:

_External borrowings_
For listed and traded instruments (i.e. Senior Secured Notes, Senior Unsecured Notes and Euro Term Loan B)
over-the-counter prices are used to determine the fair value (Level 2). For unlisted instruments the fair value is
estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using prevailing interest rates to net present value
(Level 2).

_Intercompany payables and receivables_
The fair value of fixed rate intercompany payables and receivables is estimated by discounting the future
contracted cash flow using prevailing interest rates to net present value. The fair values of the Group's
intercompany payables and receivables have been calculated at the observable unquoted interest rates and are
categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

**18 Financial instruments (continued)**

_Derivatives_
Forward contracts - these derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of
forward contracts entered into and are split between in-the-money (assets) and out-of-the-money (liabilities). At
31 December 2021, the Group held £14.1m in-the-money assets, and £24.1m out-of-the-money liabilities in
respect of its forward contracts. During the period, the Group recognised net gains on revaluation of hedged
monetary assets and liabilities from historical cost to period-end spot rate of £0.3m. The fair values of the
Group's financial derivatives have been calculated at the observable unquoted interest rates and are categorised
as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.

_Cross-currency interest rate swaps_
These derivatives are measured at fair value using a swap valuation model. The model incorporates various
observable market inputs (Level 2) including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and
forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies
and interest rate curves. The model incorporates a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative
counter-party default risk.

**_Financial risk management_**
In the ordinary course of the Group’s business, it is exposed to a variety of market risks arising in relation to its
financial assets and liabilities, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign currency risk and
capital risk. The Group has a risk management programme in place through which it seeks to mitigate the
adverse effects of these market risks. In addition, The Group hedges interest and exchange rate exposure on
foreign currency debt obligations. The Group does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative
purposes.

_Interest rate risk_
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate liabilities (based on LIBOR and EURIBOR)
primarily composed of the Senior Facilities, which consist of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A and
Term Loan B. The EURIBOR interest rate risk on Facility B is hedged through entering into cross-currency
interest rate swaps to fix the interest payments in pound sterling at rates between 3.70% - 3.76%. The Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes are set at fixed rates between 3.25% and 4.50%.

The Group, after the impact of hedge accounting, is exposed to possible changes in LIBOR on its outstanding
floating rate loan (Term Loan A). It is anticipated that a 0.5% increase in the LIBOR rate would give rise to a
decrease in profit before tax of £0.9m for the period ended 31 December 2021.

The Group’s Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities are impacted by the interest rate benchmark reform.
The Group has transitioned these agreements to the new UK risk-free rate benchmark, SONIA, which will be
applied to the Group’s next interest period starting 1 April 2022.

_Foreign currency risk_

_Forward currency hedging contracts_
The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be
affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are
managed using forward contracts.

The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31
December 2021, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward
currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases. The terms of the
forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none
exceed a period of more than 12 months after 31 December 2021. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive
income are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.

The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31
December 2021, a net unrealised gain of £43.7m was included in the hedge reserve in respect of hedging
contracts. The net gain recognised in other comprehensive income during the period in respect of these hedging
contracts was £43.7m. This consists of a £11.6m gain on not-yet-matured contracts during the period, £42.3m of
losses reclassified to the Income Statement during the period and a £10.2m taxation charge.

Under the Group’s hedging policy, the only items for which forward currency contracts are in place are forecast
purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 95% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses attributable
to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the Income Statement
at the point of sale. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash flows would be the
principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the period, therefore,
amounts recognised in the Income Statement in relation to ineffective forward contract hedges is £nil.

At 31 December 2021, the Group held £699.9m of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts, designated
as cash flow hedges. These forward contracts are largely in relation to purchases of US Dollars (notional
$944.4m) and Euros (notional €15.9m) with varying maturities up to December 2022. For the above currencies
the rates ranged from USD/GBP from 1.315 to 1.420 and Euro/GBP 1.165 to 1.189.

As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure using forward currency contracts, changes in
exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short-term profitability or cash flow. It is
anticipated that a 5% movement in the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management’s
assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of
£33.5m

_Cross-currency swap_
The Group has entered into a floating rate Euro denominated Term Loan B. The non-GBP interest and principal
repayment cash flows from the Euro debt agreement expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign exchange
rates that impact profit or loss on a consolidated basis.

**18 Financial instruments (continued)**

Under the Group’s hedging policy, the Group hedges both the foreign exchange and interest rate risk associated
with a portion of the Group’s existing, Euro foreign-currency denominated debt using EUR-GBP cross currency
interest rate swap contracts to effectively eliminate variability in the Group’s functional currency equivalent
cash flows due to variability in the EUR-GBP exchange rate and the variable interest rate. The hedge ratio is
100% on a current notional basis. The Group has excluded from the cross-currency interest rate swap both the
time value and currency basis elements of the cross-currency interest rate swap. Ineffectiveness could arise from
movements in counterparty credit spread, the non-zero fair value at the hedge designation date due to market
changes that have occurred since the instrument’s inception and changes to critical terms (e.g. reset dates, index
mismatches, payment dates). To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method
and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the change in fair value of the
hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. The amounts recognised in the Income Statement for the period
ended 31 December 2021 relating to ineffectiveness and excluded items was less than £0.1m.

At 31 December 2021, the Group holds cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) with a total nominal value
of €844.5m, designated as cash flow hedges. These swaps result in a fixed GBP interest rate ranging from
3.70% to 3.76% and EUR/GBP rate of 1.1412.

The CCIRSs were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2021, a net unrealised gain of £6.6m
was included in the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net gain recognised in other comprehensive
income during the period in respect of these swaps was £7.3m. This consists of a £34.5m loss reclassified to the
Income Statement during the period and a net gain credited to the cost of hedging reserve of £0.7m, partially
offset by a £25.5m loss on the fair value of the swaps at period end and a taxation charge of £2.4m.

The value of the CCIRSs are sensitive to movements in EURIBOR and EUR/GBP exchange rates. A 0.5%
change in EURIBOR results in a £6.5m change in value of the CCIRSs and a 5% change in the EUR/GBP
exchange rates results in a £38.1m change in the value of the CCIRSs. The amounts charged to the income
statement are not sensitive to a change in interest rates but a 5% increase in the FX rate increases the amount of
ineffectiveness by £0.4m.

_Credit risk_

The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is included in their carrying value as at the
Balance Sheet date. See note 15 for further information on trade receivables and intercompany receivables and
details of recoverability.

The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default in relation to trade receivables including
detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted.

Surplus cash is placed on short-term deposit with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the
Group Treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit.

Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses model under IFRS 9 and
no impairment is required.

_Liquidity risk_

The Group’s Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring
rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash flows. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity
of funding and flexibility using operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At 31 December 2021, the
RCF and overdraft facilities are unutilised.

At 31 December 2021, the Group held cash of £505.5m to secure short-term flexibility. The amount of financing
facilities available at the period end are disclosed below:

**Amount** **Amount**
**utilised** **remaining**

_Capital risk management_

The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure may not be sufficient to support the growth of its
business and maintain its existing credit rating. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt obligations
(including the Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes, term loans and the Senior Unsecured Notes) and
equity (issued share capital, share premium and reserves).

Part of the Group's capital risk management strategy is to monitor a broad range of financial metrics and manage
compliance with financial covenants relating to the Group's debt obligations. As at 31 December 2021, there
have been no breaches of financial covenants.

During the period, the Group issued the following notes and loans:

- Senior unsecured notes with a par value of £500.0m were issued on 24 February 2021. These notes attract
interest at 4.0% per annum and payments of interest are made on a semi-annual basis. The notes mature on 16
February 2027 and have therefore been classified as non-current. These notes are listed on The International
Stock Exchange ("TISE").

- Senior secured notes with a par value of £2,250.0m were issued on 24 February 2021. These notes attract
interest at 3.25% per annum and payments of interest are made on a semi-annual basis. The notes mature on 16
February 2026 and have therefore been classified as non-current. These notes are listed on TISE.

- Term loan A with a par value of £195.0m was entered into on 16 February 2021. This loan attracts interest at
LIBOR + 3.25% per annum and payments of interest are made on a semi-annual basis. This loan matures on 16
August 2025 and has therefore been classified as non-current.

- Euro term loan B with a par value of €845.0m was entered into on 16 February 2021. This loan attracts interest
at EURIBOR + 2.75% per annum and payments of interest are made on a semi-annual basis. This loan matures
on 16 February 2026 and has therefore been classified as non-current. The Group has entered into Cross
Currency Interest Rate Swaps relating to Euro Term Loan B to hedge the foreign currency and interest rate risk
on both the principal and interest payments. This effectively fixes the interest payments in GBP at a rate of
3.73%. This term loan is listed on TISE.

- Sterling senior secured notes with a par value of £500.0m were entered into on 5 November 2021. These notes
attract interest at 4.5% per annum and payments of interest are made on a semi-annual basis. The notes mature
on 16 February 2026 and have therefore been classified as non-current. These notes are listed on TISE.

date of 16 February 2021. Furthermore, options granted prior to the Acquisition date to participants in the
Sharesave scheme were exercised in the six-month period following completion of the Acquisition. As a result,
all share-based payment liabilities of the Group have been extinguished during the period.

**Defined benefit pension schemes**

Prior to the Acquisition, ASDA Stores Limited (“ASDA Stores”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASDA Group
Limited, provided retirement benefits for eligible employees through two defined benefit plans in the UK, one
funded, the ASDA Group Pension Scheme (“AGPS” or "the Scheme") and one unfunded, the Unapproved
Unfunded Retirement Benefit Scheme ("UURBS”).

_Background to the AGPS buy-in and buy-out_
The AGPS was subject to a buy-in transaction ("the buy-in") on 17 October 2019 through the purchase of a bulk
purchase annuity (“BPA”) policy with the insurer Rothesay Life PLC (“Rothesay”), under which the benefits
payable to all AGPS pensioners and deferred members became fully insured.

In order to enable the AGPS to execute the buy-in, ASDA Stores made a contribution in 2019 to the AGPS of
£707.5m (“the buy-in contribution”) and advanced a loan to the Scheme with an original book value of £467.3m
("the buy-in loan"). Interest is charged at an arms-length rate on this loan. To the extent that the AGPS is unable
to settle the buy-in loan balance in full out of the proceeds realised through the liquidation of assets retained by
the Scheme after buy-in, ASDA Stores is contractually obliged under a back-to-back agreement (“the BTB
Agreement”) to make a contribution to the Scheme to the value of the shortfall between the assets in the Scheme
and the outstanding balance on the buy-in loan, the proceeds of which can be used by the Scheme to settle
outstanding amounts on the buy-in loan.

At the point of the buy-in, the Scheme retained ownership of various assets, including illiquid investments and
cash, some of which will be required to meet ongoing expenses incurred by the Scheme and the remainder of
which the Scheme has used and will continue to use to repay principal and interest on the buy-in loan.

On 9 July 2021, the Trustees of AGPS completed a full buy-out of the Scheme with Rothesay. Other than
estimated pension liabilities of £0.5m (“the retained liabilities”) for which ASDA Stores remains sponsoring
employer, together with Scheme assets to that value which will be used to settle the retained liabilities, the
buy-out has extinguished the ASDA Stores’ responsibility for funding the AGPS as sponsoring employer and as
such, all other assets and liabilities of the AGPS have been de-recognised from the Group consolidated balance
sheet during the period. See further detail below for amounts recognised in the Statement of Other
Comprehensive Income and the Income Statement in respect of this.

_Amounts recognised in Other Comprehensive Income_
Prior to the buy-out on 9 July 2021, as the remaining illiquid assets and cash of the AGPS were held within the
Scheme as a separate legal entity from the Group and could be used to settle pension liabilities in the event of a
shortfall from the BPA, they met the definition of pension assets under IAS 19 - Employee Benefits. As such,
changes in the fair value of Scheme assets and liabilities in the period prior to 9 July 2021 have been accounted
for as actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income with a total net actuarial gain recognised of
£1.2m.

**20 Employee benefits (continued)**

Further, during the period, following completion of due diligence on Scheme liabilities, an amount of £15.1m in
respect of deferred consideration for the BPA arising out of the buy-in transaction was paid to Rothesay out of
Scheme assets. This amount was variable dependant on the findings of due diligence and other factors including
the timing of payments by Rothesay to the Scheme in respect of pension payments and the amount of £15.1m
was finalised during the period. As the amount paid relates to deferred consideration for the BPA, this amount
has been recognised as a loss in other comprehensive income in line with the treatment of the buy-in loss
recorded in the financial statements of ASDA Stores in 2019.

As such, the total net loss recognised during the period in other comprehensive income in respect of AGPS
assets and liabilities is £13.9m.

Further to the above, an actuarial gain of £0.7m has been recognised in respect of actuarial movement relating to
the liability of the UURBS. Total pre-tax net losses recognised in OCI are £13.2m.

_Settlement loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement_
As described above, to the extent that the AGPS is unable to make repayments of principal amounts outstanding
on the buy-in loan out of Scheme assets, ASDA Stores is obliged under the BTB Agreement to make a
contribution to the AGPS to the value of the shortfall. At the point of buy-out, the Directors have estimated the
amount outstanding on the buy-in loan which the Scheme will be able to settle without recourse to the BTB to
be £11.5m and as such, this amount has been reclassified to other receivables at the point of buy-out. The
difference between the net carrying amount of Scheme assets and liabilities and the recoverable amount of the
buy-in loan at the date of buyout - after accounting for the net actuarial loss of £13.9m described above - was
£8.7m. This amount has been recognised as a settlement loss within operating expenses.

Classification of AGPS pension cashflows
During the period, prior to the buy-out, the AGPS made repayments of principal on the buy-in loan of £38.5m
and interest payments of £0.5m. These are presented as investing inflows on the Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows.

UURBS liabilities
ASDA Stores and the Group remain liable for pension benefits payable to members of the UURBS and these
liabilities with a fair value at 31 December 2021 of £13.4m are accounted for in line with IAS 19. This amount
is included in the Scheme liabilities set out in the table below.

**Fair value of plan assets:**
At 31 December 2021 the fair value of plan assets was £0.5m. This relates to cash and cash equivalents.

Following the buy-in in October 2019, up to the date of the buy-out on 9 July 2021, the Scheme held a bulk
purchase annuity which fully insured the pension liabilities of the Scheme. Further, the Scheme retained
ownership of a variety of illiquid assets and cash balances which are measured at fair value and described earlier
in this note. From 9 July 2021, the Group is no longer the sponsoring employer of the Scheme and as such, the
BPA and other assets of the Scheme have been de-recognised as pension assets as they no longer meet the
definition of a pension asset under IAS 19, other than an amount of £0.5m retained in the AGPS to settle £0.5m
of retained AGPS liabilities.

**_Principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages)_**

**Sensitivity analysis**
The assumptions on the discount rate, inflation, and life expectancy all have a significant effect on the
measurement of the present value of the scheme liabilities. The following table provides an indication of the
sensitivity of the IAS 19 pension liability at 31 December 2021 and of the Income Statement charge for 2021, to
changes in these assumptions.

A sensitivity analysis for the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities is set out below. Note that
following the buy-out on 9 July 2021, the below sensitivities at 31 December 2021 apply only to the UURBS
liability.

**Period ended**
**31 December**
**2021**
**+ 0.1%**

**Adjustment to discount rate** **£ m**

Decrease in scheme liabilities 0.3

                                                                    Decrease in finance costs

**Period ended**
**31 December**
**2021**
**+ 0.1%**

**Adjustment to rate of inflation** **£ m**

Increase in scheme liabilities 0.3

                                                                    Increase in finance costs

**Period ended**
**31 December**
**2021**
**+ 1 Year**

**Adjustment to mortality age rating assumption** **£ m**

Increase in scheme liability 0.5

                                                                    Increase in finance costs

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When
calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in actuarial assumptions the method
applied to calculate the deferred benefits obligation is the projected unit credit method.

**Share-based payments**

Share-based payment transactions are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payments’.

Prior to the Acquisition, ASDA offered four share-based payment schemes to employees to enable them to own
shares in the former ultimate parent company, Walmart Inc. ASDA had the obligation to settle the liabilities for
the schemes, including employment taxes for participating employees, and therefore these schemes were
accounted for as cash-settled liabilities.

As described earlier in note 20, on 16 February 2021, the former immediate parent company of ASDA Group
Limited, ASDA Holdings UK Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walmart Inc., disposed of its interest in
the entire issued share capital of ASDA to Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited and the Group has
extinguished its share-based payment liabilities during the period.

The total expenses recognised for the period arising from share-based payments are as follows:

_Sharesave scheme_
The scheme was in existence for employees from 1982 and gained HMRC approval in 2000. Employees with
six months’ service were invited to join the scheme annually. Options were granted annually to employees who
elected to join, and were exercisable in three or five years from date of grant, depending on the year of grant.
The options under this scheme were treated as cash-settled. The exercise price of the options granted was equal
to the market price of the shares less 20% on the date of grant. As a condition of the SPA between AHUKL and
BAC3, employees exercised all of their sharesave options for the proportion of the vesting period elapsed at the
date of exercise. The Group settled all obligations to Walmart in relation to the options exercised during the
period.

The range of exercise price in the period was £46.00 to £73.06.

The fair value of the options outstanding under the Sharesave scheme at 31 December 2021 is £nil.

_Walmart Stock Incentive Plan (WSIP) scheme_
The scheme was in existence from 1999. Options were granted to employees annually and were exercisable in
five or seven years from date of grant, depending on the grant agreement. The options under this scheme were
treated as cash-settled. As a condition of the SPA between AHUKL and BAC3, employees exercised all of their
WSIP options for the proportion of the vesting period elapsed at the date of exercise. The Group settled all

_Restricted Stock Rights (RSR) scheme_
The RSR scheme was introduced in 2008 as an alternative to the WSIP scheme. Under the RSR scheme,
employees were awarded the right to receive a predetermined number of shares in the former ultimate parent
company of ASDA Group Limited, Walmart Inc. two or three years from the award date. All RSRs were classed
as unapproved from an Income Tax and National Insurance perspective. RSR awards were treated as
cash-settled. As a condition of the SPA between AHUKL and BAC3, employees exercised all of their RSR
options for the proportion of the vesting period elapsed at the date of exercise. The Group settled all obligations
to Walmart in relation to the options exercised during the period.

_Performance Share Plan (PSP) scheme_
The Group offered a PSP scheme, for which conditions existed in relation to exercise as described below.

The scheme came into existence on 20 July 2006. Under the scheme, selected executives and senior
management were granted the right to receive shares in Walmart Inc. provided certain pre-determined
performance goals were met. These pre-determined goals were in respect of sales growth and return on
investment. All share awards under the PSP scheme were issued for nil consideration and had a contractual life
of between 1 and 3 years. The share awards under this scheme were treated as cash-settled.

As a condition of the SPA between AHUKL and BAC3, employees exercised all of their PSP options for the
proportion of the vesting period elapsed at the date of exercise. The Group settled all obligations to Walmart in
relation to the options exercised during the period.

Non-current liabilities

The insurance provision above relates to claims liabilities arising from past events such as accidents in our
depots and stores which are not covered by third party insurance. The value of the provision is established using
independent actuarial assessments or a reasonable estimate based on past experience. These provisions are
expected to crystallise within 5 years. Insurance liabilities are not discounted as the impact would not be
material.

The dilapidation provision represents provisions for the cost of works required to remove leasehold
improvements within leasehold properties at the end of their lease term. The amount provided during the period
is accounted for within additions as an increase in the cost of property, plant and equipment and the impact of
this will be recognised as additional depreciation over the lease terms of the sites to which the provision relates.
A discount rate of 1.1% has been used in determining this provision. The provision will be utilised at the end of
the respective terms of the leases giving rise to these liabilities.

**25 Commitments**

**Capital commitments**
As at 31 December 2021, the Group had entered into contracts of £3.1m to purchase property, plant and
equipment.

**Other financial commitments**
As at 31 December 2021, the Group had entered into contracts to purchase US Dollars for £686.4m and energy
for £99.1m.

**26 Contingent liabilities**

Equal Value Claims: ASDA Stores Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, has been served with
circa 47,000 employment tribunal claims that have been presented on behalf of current and former ASDA store
employees, who allege that their work in ASDA's stores is of equal value in terms of the demands of their jobs
to that of employees working in ASDA's distribution centres, and that the differences in pay and terms and
conditions between the different jobs are not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back
pay based on higher wage rates in the distribution centres and those higher wage rates and more favourable
terms and conditions on a prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further
claims may be served.

At present, the Directors cannot predict the number of claims that may be served, and cannot reasonably
estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. On 26 March 2021, the Supreme Court
upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, that the work of hourly-paid workers in distribution centres and the work
of hourly-paid workers in stores can be compared. Despite this ruling, the Directors believe that there are
substantial factual and legal defences to these claims, and intend to defend the claims vigorously. No provision
continues to be recognised on the basis that any potential liability is only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be
confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying
economic benefits.

As a result of the change of ownership on 16 February 2021, the Group have entered into an indemnification
agreement which is guaranteed by the former ultimate parent of ASDA Stores Limited, Walmart Inc.
("Walmart") with respect to these claims. Walmart has indemnified the Group for these claims up to a
contractually agreed amount.
