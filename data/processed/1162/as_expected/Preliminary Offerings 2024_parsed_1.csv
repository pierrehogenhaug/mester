The Senior Notes Issuer is a public limited incorporated under the laws of England and Wales on September 3, 2020 to act as an intermediate holding company for Asda and the immediate holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. It is a holding company with no revenue-generating activities of its own, and no business operations, and its primary assets and liabilities, respectively, relate to an intercompany receivable of £1,683 million, its shares in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the issuance of the Senior Notes. Consequently, no separate historical consolidated financial information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has been included in this Offering Memorandum. The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum includes: - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act of 2006 (the “2021 Financial Statements”); - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022 prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act of 2006 (the “2022 Financial Statements”); and - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Senior Notes Issuer as of and for the year ended December 31, 2023 prepared in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act of 2006 (the “2023 Financial Statements,” and together with the 2021 Financial Statements and the 2022 Financial Statements, the “Financial",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The 2023 Financial Statements have been audited by KPMG LLP, as set forth in their audit reports included elsewhere herein. Unless otherwise stated, no other financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum has been audited. xii ----- In this Offering Memorandum we present certain financial information related to periods prior to 2021. Prior to 2021, we presented the financial information of Asda Group Limited and its subsidiaries. The financial information for periods prior to 2021 has been presented herein for illustrative purposes only and investors should place no reliance on such information. This Offering Memorandum does not include the audited financial statements for any period prior to 2021. There can be no assurance that, had such information been audited or reviewed, there would not have been any discrepancies (including material) compared to the financial information presented herein. In addition, all historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Senior Notes Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, the financial results of the Senior Notes Issuer do not include a full year of trading in the year ended December 31, 2021, as it acquired the trading group Asda Group Limited part way through the year on February 16, 2021. As a result, results for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the Senior Notes Issuer consolidated group do not constitute a full comparative period. In certain instances, to provide a more meaningful comparison, the results for the year ended December 31, 2021 down to the level of operating profit are presented on an annualised basis as if Asda Group Limited had been acquired by the Senior Notes Issuer on January 1, 2021. Such annualised results are derived from the financial statements of Bellis Finco plc for the period ended December 31, 2021 and the actual results of Asda Group Limited from January 1, 2021 to the date of acquisition of Asda Group by Bellis Finco plc on February, 14 2021. Following the closing date of the EG UK Acquisition on October 31, 2023, the results of EG UK were consolidated into our results. Following the closing of the Arthur Acquisition in October 2022, the CMA implemented an initial enforcement order (the “IEO”) and consequently, management concluded that the restrictions imposed by the IEO meant that the Group did not obtain control of the Arthur Business at such closing date. On May 30, 2023, after accepting our proposed remedies of disposing of 13 of the acquired sites, the CMA lifted the IEO and the results of the Arthur Business were consolidated into our results from that date. Our results in 2023 have been impacted by the revenues and expenses of the acquired business starting from the relevant date when we started consolidated the results of the applicable acquired business. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards, as adopted by the United Kingdom, and in conformity of the requirements of the UK Companies Act (“UK **IFRS”) requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying our accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in the Financial Statements. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting _Policies and Estimates.”_ In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Prospective investors should consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences between UK IFRS, the International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (“EU IFRS”) generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), UK GAAP and other systems of generally accepted accounting principles and how these differences might affect the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum, and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of UK IFRS principles may have on our results of operations and/or financial condition, as well as on the comparability of the prior periods. The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, which would apply if the Senior Secured Notes were being registered with the SEC. There could be significant differences between UK IFRS and U.S. GAAP, as applied to the Senior Notes Issuer. We neither describe the differences between UK IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile the Senior Notes Issuer’s UK IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and investors should consider this in making their investment decision. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will impose no obligation on us to reconcile the Senior Notes Issuer’s future financial statements prepared under UK IFRS to U.S. GAAP. See “Independent Auditors” for a description of the independent auditors’ reports of Ernst & Young LLP and KPMG LLP. xiii ----- In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the independent auditors’ reports from (1) KPMG LLP for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and (2) Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, state that neither KPMG LLP nor Ernst & Young LLP, as applicable, assumes responsibility to anyone (including holders of the Senior Secured Notes) other than the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer’s members, as a body, for its audit work or the audit reports or opinions it has formed. Each of KPMG LLP and Ernst & Young LLP has undertaken its audit work, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, to state to the Senior Notes Issuer’s members those matters that it is required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. Investors in the Senior Secured Notes should understand that in making these statements, the independent auditors have confirmed that they do not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as the purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes) other than to the Senior Notes Issuer and its members, as a body, with respect to the report and to the independent auditors’ audit work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting language, the recourse that investors in the Senior Secured Notes may have against the independent auditor based on its report or the consolidated financial statements to which it relates could be limited. See “Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to Financial, Reporting and Other Matters—The audit reports of Ernst & Young LLP and KPMG LLP included in this Offering Memorandum include statements purporting to limit the persons that may rely on such reports and the opinions contained therein.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,303,NOTICE TO BELGIAN INVESTORS,303.3,Certain Restatements and Reclassifications,303.3.1,,"The Group has undertaken a detailed review of its application of IAS 36 – Impairment of Assets in relation to testing for impairment of non-current assets. In particular, the Group has reassessed the application of the IAS 36 with respect to the following stages of the impairment review: - Identifying Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”) which exhibit impairment triggers; - Calculating the carrying value of CGUs which are tested for impairment; and - Calculating value-in-use (“VIU”) as part of determining the recoverable amount of CGUs. As the reassessment of the Group’s application of IAS 36 has been applied in order to provide more reliable information about the carrying value of the Group’s non-current assets at the balance sheet date, the Group has applied judgement to conclude that the effect of the revised allocation of central costs to both the assessment of impairment triggers and the forecast cashflows used in the value-in-use calculations and the allocation of central assets to CGUs should be applied to the impairment review conducted at December 31, 2022. This results in a pre-tax impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2022 of £377.4 million (posttax £312.2 million) of which £357.5 million (pre-tax) was not previously recorded in the 2022 Financial Statements. As this amount results from a change in application of the requirements of IAS 36, the Group has recorded a prior year adjustment as per the requirements of IAS 8. The Group has also carried out the same impairment review at December 31, 2021 and concluded that no changes in presentation are required as there were no significant changes in the property values in the period since the LBO Acquisition in February 2021 to the end of 2021. The net recoverable amount of the CGUs which was subject to impairment in the year ended December 31, 2022 increased in the year ended December 31, 2023 leading to a partial reversal of the impairment recorded in the year ended December 31, 2022. This resulted in a net pre-tax impairment reversal of £225.7 million (post-tax £183.4 million) being recorded in the income statement in the 2023 Financial Statements. The opening deferred tax liability includes the restatement for impairments, resulting in a reduction in the opening deferred tax liability of £65.2 million. In 2023 the Group identified that hardware assets with a net book value of £39.2 million were originally classified as intangible assets. These have been reclassified to plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings during the year ended December 31, 2023. xiv ----- During the year ended December 31, 2023, a non-operating distribution property with a carrying value of £20.5 million was reclassified as held for sale within current assets. It was determined that this asset met the criteria for being classed as held for sale. In addition, the Group’s presentation of the year ended December 31, 2022 has been restated in the 2023 Financial Statements to separately show amounts classified as other income and to present an updated impairment value Other income comprises concession and commission income and rental income. Rental income relates to income earned by the Group as a lessor from sites located in the proximity of certain stores. In the year ended December 31, 2022 and in the 2022 Financial Statements, rental income was netted against operating costs. However, in the 2023 Financial Statements, rental income has been included in other income. Other income as disclosed in note 4 of the 2022 Financial Statements was £42.5 million. Following a detailed review, amounts totalling £15.0 million of concession and commission income, which were netted against operating costs in the 2022 Financial Statements, have been reclassified in the 2023 Financial Statements and included as £57.5 million in concession and commission income, to better reflect their nature.

The Group believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (collectively, the “EBITDA Measures”) provide useful information to investors about its results of operations for the following reasons: (a) they are, or will be going forward, among the measures used by the Board of Directors and management to evaluate the Group’s underlying operating performance, review business trends, identify strategies to improve results and make day-to-day operating decisions, and (b) they allow a comparison of the Group’s results across periods and results across companies in the industry in which the Group operates on a consistent basis, by removing the effects on the Group’s operating performance of its capital structure (such as the varying levels of interest expense), asset base and capital investment cycle (such as depreciation and amortisation) and items largely outside the control of management (such as income taxes). None of the EBITDA Measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of the Group’s operating performance reported in accordance with UK IFRS. The EBITDA Measures have limitations as analytical tools, some of which are as follows: - the EBITDA Measures do not reflect the Group’s cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - the EBITDA Measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Group’s working capital needs; - none of the EBITDA Measures reflects the interest expense on the Group’s debt or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Group’s debt; - although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges, assets are depreciated or amortised over differing estimated useful lives and the assets being depreciated and amortised will often have to be replaced in the future, and the EBITDA Measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - the EBITDA Measures exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to the Group; - the EBITDA Measures are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Group’s income statement; xvii ----- - other companies in the industry in which the Group operates may calculate their own EBITDA measures differently than the Group does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures; - our calculation and presentation of the EBITDA Measures in this Offering Memorandum is similar to, but different from, the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Facilities Agreement. In particular, EBITDA reflects the adoption of IFRS 16 by the Group effective January 1, 2019, while Consolidated EBITDA calculations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement may not. Accordingly, the EBITDA Measures do not provide precise indications as to the level of our adherence to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures, the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities Agreement; and - certain adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA contain estimates that management believes reflect the underlying results of operations and are therefore subjective in nature and reflect certain adjustments for anticipated cost savings, synergies and other estimates that may not be realised, whether in part or at all.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Free Cash Flow is not a measure of liquidity under UK IFRS and has limitations as an analytical tool, some of which are as follows: - it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures by the Group, particularly because, in the case of pre-tax free cash flow, the Group’s various tax payment obligations are not deducted from such measure; - it does not deduct cash flows used by the Group in financing activities; - it is not a direct measurement of cash flows and attempts to derive and measure the Group’s ability to service debt from income statement data of the Group. Accordingly, it does not directly correlate to the actual collection of cash. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not take into account changes in working capital of the Group that are otherwise factored in when calculating its net cash from operating activities; - it does not deduct certain other items settled in cash; and xviii ----- - other companies in the industries in which the Group operates may calculate Free Cash Flow differently than it does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,303,NOTICE TO BELGIAN INVESTORS,303.5,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,303.5.13,,"In this Offering Memorandum the Group presents certain financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with UK IFRS (the “Non-IFRS Measures”). The Non-IFRS Measures included in this Offering Memorandum do not alone provide a sufficient basis to compare the Group’s performance with that of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an equivalent IFRS measure (if applicable) or any other generally accepted measure as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. Such non-IFRS financial information has not been audited or reviewed by either KPMG LLP or Ernst & Young LLP. We believe that the presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures provides investors with additional useful information to understand our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly used by investors. The Group’s Non-IFRS Measures may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. The EBITDA Measures (as defined below) and related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of financial performance under UK IFRS and should not be xv ----- considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with UK IFRS. You are encouraged to evaluate each of the adjustments reflected in the Group’s presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures and whether you consider each to be appropriate. In addition, each of the Non-IFRS Measures may be defined differently from the definitions of corresponding or similar terms under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Group’s Non-IFRS Measures have important limitations as analytical tools. Some limitations of the Non-IFRS Measures include: - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Group’s debt; - they do not reflect any cash income and certain other taxes that the Group may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Group’s statements of cash flows; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters the Group considers not to be indicative of its ongoing operations; and - in respect of Adjusted EBITDA, Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA and the other Non-IFRS Measures that reflect such measures, they reflect certain adjustments for anticipated cost savings, synergies and other estimates that may not be realised, whether in part or at all. Furthermore, you should carefully consider the risks and limitations of the Non-IFRS Measures, as they are based in part on assumptions made by the Group’s management regarding the future impact of actions that have not yet been, and which may not in fact be, implemented. For example, there is a risk that the synergies we seek to achieve may not be realised in the anticipated time frame or at all and that the magnitude of cost savings may be significantly less than expected. Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations, including in relation to the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the Group’s UK IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Measures only in a supplemental manner to evaluate the Group’s performance. Our primary Non-IFRS Measures are defined as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The CBRE Report was issued on April 12, 2024 and provides us with a valuation of the Group’s freehold and long leasehold assets, including our supermarkets, PFS, Food to Go (also referred to as Foodservice elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum) sites, industrial properties, office properties, investment properties, development and landbank sites and Distribution Centre – Held for Sale. The CBRE Report does not include de minimis non-operational parcels of lands or stores, short leaseholds, long leaseholds with no value (in each case, as assessed by the Group), or a parcel of land at Oldbury which is pending a potential planning appeal for refusal for residential development. The CBRE Report is intended to be a guide of the likely valuation of our property portfolio based on a number of assumptions including Special Assumptions (as defined below): - _Supermarket Portfolio: Market Value on the Special Assumption that each Property is let to Asda Stores Limited at CBRE’s opinion of rental value on a full repairing and insuring basis (“FRI”) for a term of 25 years commencing at the Valuation Date, with annual upward only rent reviews linked to the consumer price index (“CPI”) with a cap and collar of 1% to 4% per annum. - _Industrial Portfolio: Market Value on the Special Assumption of that each Property is let to Asda Stores Limited at CBRE’s opinion of rental value on a FRI basis for a term of 20 years, commencing at the Valuation Date, with five yearly upward only rent reviews to the higher of open market rental value or CPI subject to, a cap and collar of 2% to 4% per annum (compounded annually). - _Offices Portfolio: Market Value on the Special Assumption that each Property is let to Asda Stores Limited, at CBRE’s opinion of rental value, on an FRI basis for a term of 15 years, commencing at the Valuation Date, with five yearly upward only rent reviews linked to CPI, with a cap and collar of 1% to 3% per annum (compounded annually). - _Food to Go Portfolio (the Food to Go Portfolio comprises drive through or drive to sites occupied and _operated by a Starbucks franchisee): Market Value on the Special Assumption that each Property is let_ to Egspresso Limited in accordance with the terms of the Template Lease provided to CBRE by the Group, on an FRI basis, and at the current rent payable under licence for each of the sites as confirmed to CBRE by the Group. The Template Lease is for a term of 20 years, assumed to commence at the Valuation Date, with three yearly upward only rent reviews linked to the retail prices index with a cap and collar of 1% to 3%, compounded annually. For the Supermarket, Industrial, Office and Food to Go Portfolios, CBRE’s opinion of Market Value is subject to the Special Assumptions outlined above and makes no allowance for tenant incentives such as rent-free period or capital contributions. It is assumed that a purchaser has no liability with respect to capital expenditure or repair costs and that Asda Stores Limited (Egspresso Limited for Food to Go Portfolio) is responsible for outgoings including the payment of business rates and service charges but not the payment of head rents associated with long leasehold interests (where applicable). xxxvii ----- Note for the above where a lease to Asda Stores Limited (Egspresso Limited for Food to Go Portfolio) is assumed to be in place, the valuations are based on CBRE’s view of the perception of investors to the covenant strength of Asda Stores Limited (Egspresso Limited for Food to Go Portfolio), as at the valuation date. Any change in the covenant strength of Asda Stores Limited (Egspresso Limited for Food to Go Portfolio) could have material impact on the valuation reported. The Market Value of the Supermarket, Industrial, Office and Food to Go Portfolios, subject to the Special Assumptions referenced above, will result in valuations which differ from the Market Value of the Properties as at the valuation date. Should any different special assumption be adopted with respect to the lease, including details such as tenant covenant, rent, lease length, rent review provisions, repairing provisions (amongst other lease terms) this will also result in a difference in the valuation. - _Petrol Filling Station Portfolio: Market Value.

The change in the CBRE Prime Benchmark Yield occurred between June 2022 and December 2022, and there was no change in 2023. Some categories of supermarket investment did however experience yield expansion in the second half of 2023, primarily those assets subject to over-rent and/or with secondary property characteristics. The CBRE Prime Benchmark Yield does not encompass all categories of supermarket investment but provides a high-level indication of the impact of market change in this period. Investment yields for supermarket investments may have changed by a greater or lesser degree than the CBRE Prime Benchmark Yield. The drivers of yield expansion during this period were: - Geo-political risk; - Negative Economic Outlook, cautious investor outlook, “Mini-Budget”; - Persistent inflationary pressure; - Rising Interest Rates leading to higher cost of capital; - Selective investor demand with an increased focus on risk and store fundamentals; and - Increased sensitivity to over-rent and income risk.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2369,VALUATION REPORT,2369.11,Terms and Assumptions,2369.11.1,,"The valuation of all properties was based on their current use. CBRE made various assumptions as to tenure, letting, taxation, town planning, and the condition and repair of buildings and sites (including ground and groundwater contamination). If any of the information or assumptions on which the valuations are based are subsequently found to be incorrect, the valuation may also be incorrect and should be reconsidered. Where possible assumptions were checked against the high-level information made available by the Group. The valuation assumed that all properties included had the benefit of freehold or leasehold titles, free from restrictions that would have impacted the value. The valuation assumes that the long leasehold interests contain no restrictions that would prevent the sale of the relevant properties to a purchaser in the investment market. xl ----- The investment properties are generally situated adjacent to Asda supermarkets. The valuation assumes that either a separate sale of the investment property could be achieved through the creation of a new title, separate from the retail supermarket or that alternatively the investment property could be sold with the supermarket in the same transaction. In particular, in preparation of the CBRE Report, CBRE assumed each property to be the authorised use under planning legislation and in accordance with the use registered with the relevant regulatory agency. During the course of their engagement, CBRE did not perform site inspections, environmental audit, tests of services and amenities, investigations or tests as to the condition of the properties. CBRE did not make planning or permitting enquiries and did not examine deeds, leases or other documents relating to the title to our properties. The CBRE Report was produced based on certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, the assumptions that (i) our properties are not adversely affected by any existing or proposed environmental law and are free from, environmental issues such as contamination, deleterious materials, flooding, ground conditions, invasive or protected plants or species and the properties are not adversely affected by any existing or proposed environmental law, (ii) there are no abnormalities as to repair and condition of the properties, all properties are free from defect, in good repair and condition and well maintained and in marketable condition, compliant with all building, accessibility and fire safety regulations and there are no abnormalities as to repair and condition of the properties, (iii) properties possess a good and marketable freehold title free from any onerous restrictions or conditions, and all title, tenure, lettings, planning, taxation, statutory and local authority requirements are complied with, (iv) all properties benefit from full access and egress rights together with sufficient parking and loading facilities and are connected to all main services, (v) the floor areas supplied by Asda comply with the RICS Code of Measuring Practice (vi) no capital expenditure is required in respect of the properties and (vii) that the properties all have valid energy performance certificates compliant with the relevant regulations in each jurisdiction of the United Kingdom.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,2369,VALUATION REPORT,2369.12,Bases of Value and Methodology,2369.12.1,,"All properties were valued in accordance with the Red Book and on the basis of Market Value, Market Value subject to Special Assumptions (as outlined above) or “Investment Value (Worth)” as set out above. The RICS Valuation—Global Standards contains mandatory rules, best practice guidance and related commentary for all members undertaking asset valuations. These valuation standards define Market Value as “the estimated amount for which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently, and without compulsion.” As required by the mandatory rules of the RICS, CBRE has confirmed to us that they do not have a material conflict of interest when preparing the CBRE Report, and that they adhere to the rules of conduct, as set out by the RICS. CBRE determined the Market Value subject to the Special Assumptions outlined above for the Supermarket, Industrial, Office and Food to Go Portfolios by applying a yield to their assumed rental income. The Market Value of the Supermarket, Industrial, Office and Food to Go Portfolios, subject to the Special Assumptions referenced above, will result in valuations which differ from the Market Value of the Properties as at the valuation date. Should a different special assumption be adopted with respect to the lease, including details such as tenant covenant, rent, lease length, rent review provisions, repairing provisions (amongst other lease terms) this will result in a difference in the valuation. For the Supermarket, Industrial and Office Portfolio and Food to Go Portfolios, the Market Value at the valuation date would be lower than the Market Value subject to the Special Assumptions referenced above. This is because the Market Value would disregard the lease referenced by CBRE in their Special Assumptions. CBRE determined the Market Value for the Petrol Filling Station Portfolio utilising the trading/profits methodology. Rental values were prepared on the basis of methods adopted by CBRE as appropriate in assessing the Market Value (subject to Special Assumptions where relevant) and are not necessarily appropriate for other purposes, nor do they necessarily accord with the definition of Market Rent in the Red Book, which is as follows: “The estimated amount for which an interest in real property should be leased on the valuation date between a willing lessor and a willing lessee on appropriate lease terms in an arm’s length transaction, after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.” xli ----- Investment Value (or Worth) is defined in International Valuation Standards as “The value of an asset to a particular owner or prospective owner for individual investment or operational objectives.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Overview,9.1.1,,"We are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom and the second-largest grocery retailer in the North of England, Scotland and Wales (in each case in terms of Till Roll data on a 52-week basis as of January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We operate a significant store estate of over 1,200 large stores and convenience sites that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom. We also have the second largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We are also now a major player in the UK convenience market, having added 472 convenience sites (including petrol filling stations) to our portfolio, as well as 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites), following the Arthur Acquisition and EG UK Acquisition. These acquisitions have given us significant foothold in the fast-growing convenience market which, alongside our existing fuel portfolio, makes us the second-largest independent fuel owner-operator in the United Kingdom. The graph below compares our total grocery market share with that of other major UK grocery retailers based on Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel. _(Source: Kantar Worldpanel, Take Home Panel, Grocery, 52 w/e January 21[st] 2024, Till Roll.)_ We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household expenditure on food and beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through economic fluctuations. Groceries are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and 1 ----- during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed only by a slight contraction as the pandemic eased. Since, the UK grocery retail market has experienced consistent growth, achieving a record-high size of £144.0 billion in sales for the 52week period ended December 24, 2023, according to Kantar Worldpanel, despite facing high inflation and global geopolitical tensions in 2022 and 2023. See also “Industry.” One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is in turn centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to offering high quality products with low prices to our customers and our wholly-owned supplier, International Procurement and Logistics Ltd (“IPL”), which enables us to take a vertically-integrated approach to procurement and which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and well-established George Clothing and George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers, our growing presence in the convenience and foodservice market, our popular customer loyalty programme Asda Rewards, and our team of flexible and engaged colleagues. We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenue was £25.6 billion (including fuel), with 16.5% of sales made online, our net cash flow from operating activities was £1,245.8 million, our profit for the year was £194.5 million, and our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was £1,264 million. Excluding the results of the EG UK Business, which was acquired on October 31, 2023, and the results of the Arthur Business, which was consolidated from May 31, 2023, the chart below presents the breakdown of our 2023 revenue by product category (food, general merchandise, clothing and petrol), and channel (stores and online (including George.com)). _(Source: Asda information. Year ended December 31, 2023. Note: excluding approximately £588 million from the Arthur Acquisition, £411 million from the EG UK Acquisition and £199 million of other revenue from Asda Mobile sales, financial services sales, shipping and wrapping revenue, pharmacy revenue and, until the EG UK Acquisition, Asda On The Move.)_ Our differentiated operating model has resulted in strong financial performance: our successful financial profile is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditure KPI) and cash conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. For more information on our differentiated operating model, see “—Key Strengths—We benefit from a differentiated operating model.”_ Between 2021 and 2023, our average profit margin (defined as profit for the year divided by revenue) was 4.3%, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.2% (including fuel), our cumulative cash flows from 2 ----- operating activities totalled £3,340.6 million, cumulative free cash flow was approximately £2,097 million and our average cash conversion was 68%. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial _Data—Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_ We believe that our business, operating model and financial performance also benefit from our significant freehold real estate asset portfolio, which also can provide a potential source of liquidity. See “Valuation Report.” In 2023, through the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and 2023 Ground Rent Transaction, we have been able to, and in the future may continue to, selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to take advantage of favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities. See “—Lease Agreements.” We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we maintain a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom. We have made more than £300 million annualized price investment since 2022 across over 1,200 lines. Within the UK value market, we have strong market shares across core grocery products (13.1%), beers, wines and spirits (12.8%), impulse grocery (12.1%), household and pet (12.1%), frozen (11.4%) and total grocery (11.4%) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). Our offer is strong across the full food basket: our category market shares range from 9.6% to 13.1% (except health and beauty)(in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal Asda data, our prices are approximately 2.5% to 6.1% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on the average of the first eight weeks in 2024, based on total goods price gap percentage). We believe our prices continue to compete with those of discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. In January 2024, we launched a new price matching programme where we have price matched Aldi and Lidl on approximately 300 comparable grocery products, which reduced prices by an average of 17% to match whichever discounter had the lowest price on these products. Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is supplemented by a large clothing and general merchandise business. We offer our entire range of food and non-food products to customers as an accessible “one-stop shop” experience that is supported and enhanced by our strong online offer and expansion into the convenience market under the Asda Express banner. We believe our omni-channel offer, through which we reach customers at our brick-and-mortar stores and through our significant online offering and on our app, appeals to our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic increased use of and engagement with our online platforms. In the first half of 2021, there were approximately 8.6 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with order growth from approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended February 28, 2020) to an average of more than 773,000 weekly orders in 2021 (based on the average weekly orders for the first 26 weeks of 2021) and a peak of more than 850,000 orders during the third lockdown (based on the seven days to January 15, 2021). Online engagement has fallen from the peaks experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have continued to grow our online business, with an average of approximately 774,000 weekly orders in 2022 and 2023 (based on the average weekly orders in 2022 and 2023). We also offer at-home delivery and customers are able to collect their purchases at one of approximately 460 Asda Click & Collect sites. Our business model integrates our store-based and online offer by leveraging our stores to fulfil online orders. 3 ----- Our online grocery business is profitable within one of the world’s most developed online grocery markets. According to Kantar Worldpanel, as of January 21, 2024, we operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, holding 19.3% of market share (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales), growing our market share in a market that is 5.5% larger on a one-year basis (comparing Total Grocery Absolute Online Sales from the 52 weeks ended January 22, 2023 to the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024). Our online business is already of significant scale; the chart below shows the growth of our online sales, including a breakdown of online grocery versus George.com sales, for the periods presented. _(Source: Asda information.)_ According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the third-largest online clothing, footwear and accessories retailer in the United Kingdom by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024 and we held 8.5% of the total UK online clothing, footwear and accessories market by volume for the 24 weeks ended January 7, 2024. Combined sales for our online grocery business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion (of which £1.5 billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £3.6 billion in 2023 (of which £3.2 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR of 16.2% between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, our ‘toyou’ service allows customers to conveniently collect and return orders from George.com and other partner retailers at our stores. We have partnered with 112 brands and processed more than 4.4 million parcels in the year ended December 31, 2023. We also have a strong presence in the convenience market with significant opportunity for additional expansion in this fast-growing sector. In October 2022, we took our first notable step into the convenience market after acquiring 132 sites including 129 convenience sites attached to forecourts from the Co-op (the “Co-op sites,” and such business, the “Arthur Business”) and three development sites as part of the Arthur Acquisition. We agreed to divest 13 of the Co-op sites following the recommendation of the CMA after an Initial Enforcement Order stemming from its review of the acquisition. The disposals of these sites completed across December 2023 to January 2024 for proceeds of £25.2 million. Each Co-op site included a grocery retail store between 1,500 and 3,000 square feet of space and an attached petrol filling station driving footfall. In October 2023, we acquired the majority of EG Group’s business in the United Kingdom for total cash consideration of £2.1 billion (including transaction fees). The deal represented a major step in our convenience proposition, adding 356 well-invested PFSs to our convenience portfolio, 161 of which are stand-alone and 195 of which are co-located with foodservice concessions, as well as 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). In foodservice, we acquired franchises for some of the United Kingdom’s best loved outlets, including Greggs, Subway, Burger King and Sbarro, as well as our own proprietary brand, Leon. Certain of our acquired sites also continue to benefit from an additional KFC and Starbucks non-Group branded offerings operated by third parties. Through this acquisition, we accessed another high-growth sector, foodservice, tapping into a new market which is highly complementary to Asda’s current offering. Each of the acquired sites are community-focused and strategically located at the heart of residential areas with a diversified footprint across the United Kingdom, and represent broader retail destinations with ancillary services such as parcel delivery, car wash and last mile food delivery, with opportunity to expand further. The acquired sites also present a significant 4 ----- opportunity for further synergies across Asda’s business through higher volumes, buying synergies and cost savings through operational leverage. In September 2023, we began the conversion of the Co-op sites from Co-op branding to our Asda Express banner, implementing Asda pricing across fuel and grocery upon conversion. We completed the conversion of the remaining convenience sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in March 2024. Total capex investment to convert the stores to Asda Express was approximately £17 million. We believe we will be able to bring Asda’s great value to even more customers across the United Kingdom by reaching new communities and shoppers with this smaller store format. In the converted Co-op sites, our Asda Express prices were an average of 6.1% cheaper than their corresponding prices under Co-op ownership. We also have further organic Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in 2023 and a strong pipeline of approximately 40 sites that have been identified for potential opening in 2024. Going forward, our focus will be on the continued integration of the Co-op sites and EG UK Business into the Asda Group and delivering synergies. Currently, with our team of approximately 150,000 flexible and engaged colleagues, with around 98,000 fulltime employees, serving approximately 16.8 million customer trips each week (based on the average of weeks 37 to 40 of 2023), we are committed to and deeply invested in the UK food supply chain. Our business model is supported by diversification. First, we are a mass market retailer that serves the entire UK population, in terms of both customer demographics and geography, with our customer base skewing slightly towards value-seeking families, younger shoppers and lower-income customers who are attracted by our strategy to offer high quality products at low prices and with strong market shares in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. For more information about our customer mix, see “—Our Customers,” and for more information about the geographic distribution of our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.” Second, we believe we are well-positioned geographically, with a strong regional footprint across the United Kingdom. Our store footprint is strongest in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Our large and diverse store estate offers customers a variety of differentiated shopping formats. We operate 30 supercentres, 396 superstores, 153 supermarkets, 30 Asda Living stores, 499 convenience sites (including our petrol filling stations) and 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). For more information on our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.” We continue to benefit from certain support provided by Walmart through the Transitional Agreements, primarily in relation to the continued use of its IT platform. We have set up a dedicated team to facilitate the transition of our IT environment away from the Walmart ecosystem and onto a stand-alone IT solution, which we refer to as Project Future. We believe Project Future presents significant opportunities in terms of our efficiency, data capabilities, customer experience and competitive edge and are targeting complete separation from Walmart by the end of 2024. See “—Our Technology and Information Systems,” “Certain Relationships and Related Party _Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions— Delays in our ability to separate from Walmart could result in significant cost and any issues with the separation process, particularly related to our transition to a new IT system, could significantly disrupt business operations and impact our ability to meet our strategic objectives.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Key Strengths,9.2.1,We are a business of significant scale with a history of resilient performance,"_We operate in a large, historically stable, resilient and growing industry with favourable macroeconomic tailwinds_ We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market, which has demonstrated resilient performance underpinned by favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household spend on food and beverages. For example, UK GDP growth has shown stable development over the years. Although the United Kingdom’s GDP declined by 10.4% in 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, GDP rebounded in 2021, returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2022 and amounted to approximately £2.0 trillion in 2023, according to Fitch Solutions, with an average expected GDP growth of approximately 0.4% from 2023 to 2025. 5 ----- The UK grocery retail market is also characterised by favourable demographic characteristics, including a growing population. According to ONS, the UK population is projected to grow from 67 million in 2021 to over 73 million by 2036, which is expected to result in an overall increase in the consumer base for groceries. In addition to its historical stability, the UK grocery retail market is also resilient. In 2023, grocery retail was the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom – valued at £200.5 billion on a Retail Value RSP (as defined herein) basis, according to Euromonitor. Groceries are a necessary and stable consumer expenditure, which generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets that involve more discretionary spending. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history during and following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic: between 2009 and 2016, the UK grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 2.2% and between 2016 and 2023, the UK grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 3.1%, with a growth CAGR of 4.6% during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019 and 2020. Additionally, during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, according to ONS, the percentage of average weekly household spend on food and non-alcoholic drinks remained fairly consistent at approximately 11.0%, demonstrating the market’s resilience during periods of macroeconomic difficulty, and this percentage spiked to 14.4% in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting an increase in at-home consumption during the pandemic. This percentage has remained relatively flat in the intervening years, ranging between 10.5% and 11.8% from 2007 to 2022. In recent years, as the COVID-19 global pandemic was waning, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked an energy crisis which further accelerated growing inflation and cost of living pressures. However, according to Kantar Worldpanel, the UK grocery market, comprised of grocers (and excluding non-grocers), has grown by 8.7% over the past three years (on a Till Roll basis for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, compared to the 52 weeks ended January 24, 2021). _We are the United Kingdom’s third-largest grocer, holding sizeable market share_ According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom, with 13.7% of market share and the second-largest grocery retailer in the North of England, Scotland and Wales (based on Till Roll data over 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024). For the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenue was £21.9 billion (excluding fuel). We have a network of over 1,200 large stores and convenience sites throughout the United Kingdom, with a particular focus on superstores, supermarkets, online formats and convenience. We are also the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom by value (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel), and have grown our market share over many years, maintaining this share in a much-enlarged market as customers turned to online shopping throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we believe that we are well-positioned as a large and established business with a clear set of peers. We also believe that our multi-format, omni-channel offer positions us well to compete effectively and to continue growing our market share. Following the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition, which gave us a significant foothold in the convenience and foodservice markets, our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2023 were £25,619.9 million and £1,078 million, respectively, compared to £24,477.8 million and £867 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that we also hold a leading position in the UK foodservice market. We cater to a broad target demographic, which we believe provides us a long-term competitive advantage. In contrast to discounters, we provide a broad range of branded and own-brand offers, while also having a more developed and established online platform. _We believe we have faced the greatest impacts of discounters on our market_ The adverse impact of discounters (primarily Aldi and Lidl) on the traditional grocers in recent years has been significant but, while we believe that discounters will continue to put pressure on the market, we believe that we and other traditional grocers have already faced the greatest impacts of this competition in the markets in which we operate and, if anything, that the discounters pose a greater challenge to other traditional grocers, who we believe are more geographically exposed to the areas where discounters are likely to focus in the near-term. As compared to our traditional grocer peers, our geographical concentration is in the North of England, Scotland and Wales, as evidenced by our number two market shares in those regions. The discounters have already 6 ----- penetrated these areas and we expect the discounters to continue to shift the focus of their expansion to the South of England, the East of England and London, where we operate fewer sites as compared to the Midlands, the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Furthermore, the catchment areas of 76.7% of our stores already contain both major discounters, Aldi and Lidl, which is a higher percentage than any of our traditional grocer competitors (the boundary used is a 10-minute drive-time radius around each point, which is consistent regardless of location type or size of store, but excludes convenience stores, and stores are only included in the count where there is both Aldi and Lidl stores present within the drive-time boundary). Therefore, we believe that our current performance already factors in the adverse impact of discounters to a large extent. Moreover, according to Kantar Worldpanel, we have stemmed the losses to the discounters in recent months, and we have reduced switching losses to the discounters to a two-year record low for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2024. Together, Lidl and Aldi account for 17.5% of the market, with Aldi’s share at 9.8% and Lidl at 7.6% in each case on the basis of Till Roll data and according to Kantar Worldpanel for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024. However, the growth experienced by the discounters has begun to fall sharply, with Aldi posting growth behind the market for the four weeks ended January 21, 2024, and Lidl’s growth decreasing over 50% for the same period compared to the four weeks ended January 22, 2023. We also believe we can reduce losses to the discounters through our value proposition, including our opening price point range, Just Essentials. In January 2024, we also launched a new price matching programme where we have price matched Aldi and Lidl on 287 comparable grocery products, which reduced prices by an average of 17% to match whichever discounter had the lowest price on these products. _We have demonstrated resilience through downturns_ Just as our market has proven resilient in times of economic difficulty and uncertainty, our business has also proven resilient during recent economic and market downturns, including during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as through the rise of discounters in the UK grocery retail market in more recent years, particularly during 2014 to 2016. During the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, we continued to perform well, achieving an average like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) growth rate of 6.1% for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. Our EBITDA margins have also remained stable, ranging from 4.7% to 4.9% between 2007 and 2023. Despite the significant social and economic shifts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, our business experienced strong overall performance, particularly in our online and supermarket formats. Overall, our food business performed consistently throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an initial increase in sales due to panic buying and customers stocking-up on key staples at the outset of each of the first three lockdown periods. Following an initial decline at the beginning of the first lockdown, our general merchandise business also generally performed well throughout these lockdown periods, due to increasing purchases of homeware products. While our clothing business was initially negatively impacted during the early stage of the first UK lockdown period, we experienced improved performance in this business in line with an overall improvement of the general economy and a rebound in consumer confidence. Recently, geopolitical tensions and ongoing inflation above historical norms and the Bank of England’s target have led to uncertainty in the market and for our consumers. However, we have remained highly resilient in the face of these challenges and have kept focused on supporting customers and colleagues with cost-of-living pressures, whilst continuing to deliver strong financial results. During times of economic stress, we believe our value proposition is particularly appealing to customers and can drive sales: we benefited from increased sales generating revenue (excluding fuel) of £21.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to £20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. As the current high inflationary environment persists, we are focused on initiatives to support our customers in the cost-of-living crisis and protect market share by investing in price and quality, which we believe can drive growth. For example, in 2022, we also launched our new grocery opening price point range, Just Essentials by Asda that expands the range of its predecessor, Asda Smart Price, from approximately 160 to 272 products with new branding and reformulations for taste and quality. In the same year, we also rolled out a “Dropped and Locked” price campaign, where we locked in the prices of over 100 grocery items to give customers certainty around their shopping costs during the year, as well as our loyalty rewards programme, Asda Rewards, as an indirect cost-saving scheme for customers to earn cash back on their shopping. 7 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Key Strengths,9.2.2,"We benefit from a differentiated operating model, including a diversified proposition with unique multi-format and multi-channel offering","_We have well-developed own-brands_ We believe that our own-brand offers have been a key strength of our business and continue to offer growth opportunities. We have an extensive own-brand product range in our food business, with approximately 7,800 own-brand SKUs. Our approach to range development and innovation enables us to identify and meet changing customer needs and has resulted in the creation of many award-winning products; we launched approximately 950 lines in 2021, 1,547 new lines in 2022 and 1,597 new lines in 2023, and approximately 3,858 lines were reformulated in 2023. As a result of the EG UK Acquisition, we also acquired Leon, our own proprietary foodservice brand. In addition to our diverse and extensive product offer with our own-brand range, we have also been able to drive growth through service and price positioning. We leverage our IPL sourcing model to deliver value, especially in our produce, cooked meats and wine segments. In particular, the introduction and development of the opening price point range, Just Essentials, has been key to helping customers with the cost-of-living pressures in 2023 after the “Dropped and Locked” price campaigns in 2022, where we locked in the prices of over 100 grocery items to give customers certainty around their shopping costs during that year. We also offer own-brands through George, see “—The George Clothing _and George Home offers are generally profitable and well-established.” We are driven by our commitment to delivering low prices to our customers_ We believe our commitment to delivering low prices to our customers is a competitive advantage as we aim to lead on price while staying competitive on assortment and quality. We believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal Asda data, our prices are approximately 2.5% to 6.1% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on average for the first eight weeks in 2024, based on total goods price gap percentage). Following the implementation of our Aldi and Lidl price matching programme, which runs alongside our established customer value propositions, including Just Essentials, Asda Smart Price, our price locking campaigns, Fab 5 and Asda Rewards, we believe our prices can compete with those of discounters. Our low prices are supported by rigorous cost control and a commitment to affordability, which enables us to control expenses so that we can pass cost savings on to our customers. _Loyal customer base through our reward loyalty programme, Asda Rewards_ In 2022, we launched our new loyalty programme, Asda Rewards. The app-based scheme enables customers to earn cash back on their shopping, building Asda Pounds in their cash pots to spend in store. The programme also provides the opportunity to leverage data insights which enables us to better target investment in the customer proposition. Asda Rewards total users and penetration among customers has grown quickly, with over 7.5 million new users joining over the last 12 months and a total of 1.6 million members who have registered for Blue Light. The number of total active customers reached 4.9 million as of December 31, 2023 over the prior 30-day period, and the programme has earned around £300 million revenue in 2023. 8 ----- The following graph shows the increasing sales penetration, or the number of sales linked to customers using Asda Rewards since its inception, which reached 50.6% in the week of Christmas in 2023: By the end of 2023, we saw approximately 47% of sales linked to Asda Rewards. We have found that after joining Asda Rewards, members spend more than non-members within every segment and are more likely to become repeat customers. In particular, we believe that members spend more than 10% after joining the programme (measured through tokenised payment cards) and for our high value customers, we believe that this equates to an incremental addition of approximately £11 per week. By driving sales volume, the loyalty scheme has been incrementally profitable since shortly after its launch, and the Retail Media segment has achieved £103.1 million profit. The following graph shows the average sales by quarter of Asda Rewards members versus non-members. _We operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, which is profitable_ The United Kingdom has one of the most developed online grocery retail markets in the world, with one of the highest rates of the population using the internet. There has been a significant shift in the grocery retail market away from brick-and-mortar stores to online purchasing as demographic trends, greater mobile and device usage, improved service proposition and technological advances in applications and customer interfaces have driven 9 ----- increasing penetration rates in the online grocery retail market. We believe we are poised to take advantage of these favourable consumer trends, as we have already established ourselves in the rapidly growing UK online grocery retail market and our store and warehouse footprint is strategically positioned across attractive geographic areas to service the growing demand for groceries online. According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the second-largest online grocery retail platform in the United Kingdom, holding 19.3% of market share (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) for the 52-week period ended January 21, 2024. Having responded quickly to the increase in demand for online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to grow our online business, with an average of approximately 774,000 weekly orders in 2022 and 2023 (based on the average weekly orders in 2022 and 2023). As a result of our strong performance in the online market, combined sales for our online grocery business and George.com rapidly increased from previous years to a total of £3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 (of which £3.2 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales) as compared to £3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 (of which £2.9 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales). According to Kantar Worldpanel, we hold an 8.5% share of the UK online clothing, footwear and accessories market (in terms of volume of units sold on a 24-week basis as of January 7, 2024). We believe there is greater scope for our online profitability to improve further. We expect that the demand for online groceries will continue to be strong as customers increasingly adopt online shopping as a more permanent and preferred way to purchase groceries. _The George Clothing and George Home offers are generally profitable and well-established_ We launched our clothing offer, George, in 1990 and it is the third-largest clothing footwear and accessories retailer in the United Kingdom by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024 and is the leading UK childrenswear retailer with 18.7% market share by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024, in each case according to Kantar Worldpanel. Despite challenges to this product category overall, our online clothing sales have increased from £379.3 million for the year to December 31, 2021 to £423.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, with 82% of all sales made via mobile devices in 2023. We believe this demonstrates our strength in the online segment, which is a key part of our operating model. Additionally, we have expanded the George branded offer to include general merchandise, including through collaborations with strategic partners. We have extended product ranges with partners who specialise in certain categories, have a strong affinity fit with our existing customers and bring complementary expertise and reputation, such as in homeware with Stacey Solomon and Claire’s in jewellery and accessories. The George Home brand generated approximately £747.7 million in sales and contributed approximately 50.0% of our total general merchandising sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. Sales by the George Home brand grew at a CAGR of approximately 3% between the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2023. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product categories generally have higher margins than our food product categories.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Key Strengths,9.2.3,We benefit from a well invested and vertically integrated model and are supported by a significant asset base,"_We benefit from vertically integrated procurement through IPL_ We believe that we have a competitive advantage in food sourcing via our captive sourcing arm, IPL, which enables us to take a vertically integrated approach to procurement. We believe that IPL provides us with valuable sourcing differentiation as compared to our competitors. IPL is one of the largest importers of produce in the United Kingdom and, while IPL is a group company and exclusively serves Asda, it is also our largest supplier. The aim of our vertically integrated procurement model is to consolidate import activity for key products and reduce our overall costs. In 2023, we purchased £1,724 million of our products through IPL. The foundation of IPL’s cost-price advantage is that it eliminates the “middleman” who typically serves as the intermediary in the supply chain, thereby giving us greater control of costs, quality and supply of a diverse range of products. We have an extensive IPL footprint across the United Kingdom, with nine processing facilities across the country and more than 3,793 colleagues as of the year ended December 31, 2023. Our IPL product mix is diversified according to our needs, with a mix of 56% fruit and vegetables, 28% protein, 7% plants and flowers, 6% beverages and 3% grocery in 2023. Additionally, we have been able to build upon and benefit from our supplier relationships to deliver supply chain continuity and make progress in our sustainability agenda. For example, through IPL we are supporting industry projects on water stewardship in our produce supply chain. 10 ----- We also believe that IPL has provided greater stability and allowed us greater control over our supply chain now that the United Kingdom has left the European Union’s single market and customs union. IPL’s EU supply chain ensures IPL takes control of the transport direct from its suppliers’ sites. This allows IPL to appoint experts in haulage and freight clearance, removing delays at the various border control points and ensuring the most efficient supply chain. IPL’s logistics team are based in Spain, which is the top EU exporting country into the United Kingdom for fresh produce. This has ensured IPL quickly understands any impacts to supply chains, such as localised disruption by the farming fraternity, allowing IPL to take actions to protect the supply chains. _We are supported by a significant asset portfolio_ We are supported by a well-invested and geographically diversified store estate and benefit from a total real estate portfolio of £8.5 billion, which is comprised of freehold and long leasehold assets, and includes £756 million of certain properties owned by the Group but pledged as collateral for the benefit of the creditors under the Ground Rent Facility. As of December 31, 2023, 77% of our asset portfolio was comprised of freehold or long leaseholds, based upon attributable EBITDAR per property (less central allocations), with certain adjustments made to align the calculation methodology across the Group’s properties following the EG UK Acquisition and the Arthur Acquisition. Of this 77%, 12% is attributable to certain properties that are pledged as collateral for the benefit of the creditors under the Ground Rent Facility. Our valuable real estate portfolio also provides a potential source of liquidity and underpins our strong ongoing cash flow generation. On August 10, 2023, we completed the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions with Realty Income, which resulted in proceeds of £646 million that were used to finance a portion of the EG UK Acquisition. On December 12, 2023, we also completed the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction with a number of investors, which resulted in proceeds of £400 million that were used to repay a bridge loan that was used to finance a portion of the EG UK Acquisition. In the future we may continue to selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to take advantage of favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities. See “Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements—2023 Sale and Leaseback Facility” and “Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Ground Rent Transactions – Ground Rent Facility.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Key Strengths,9.2.4,We have strong exposure to the resilient convenience and PFS channel with upside through synergies,"In December 2022, we opened our first two convenience sites under the Asda Express banner. We also have further organic Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in early 2024 and a strong pipeline of approximately 30 sites that have been identified for potential opening in 2024. The Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition gave us a strong presence in the fast-growing convenience market, having added 472 convenience sites and petrol filling stations to our portfolio. The Arthur Acquisition comprised 116 convenience stores with PFSs attached and the EG UK Acquisition comprised 356 PFSs (including two that have since been shut) with convenience stores and 124 standalone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). These acquisitions accelerated our growth in the convenience sector and strategic ambition to bring our value heritage as a consumer champion to even more customers. We completed the conversion of all the sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in March 2024. See also “— _Business Strategy—Location.” We believe our recent acquisitions will drive our results by delivering additional net_ working capital and EBITDA synergies as we integrate buying for the wider convenience network into Asda and seek to drive higher volumes and growth as a result of price investment in the fuel and grocery offering. We also expect synergies to arise from range optimisation, monetisation of customer data, our increased scale, in-store marketing income, improvement in fuel card terms and operational efficiencies. See “Summary Historical Consolidated _Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_ According to Euromonitor, in 2023, the UK convenience market was approximately £44 billion and the UK foodservice market was approximately £67 billion, and the UK convenience market has grown at a faster rate than the UK grocery retail market relative to 2015. Our exposure to these highly attractive and profitable convenience and foodservice markets is underpinned by favourable structural factors including (i) the rise of shopping locally, (ii) the evolution of shopper missions, (ii) the shift of our offering to a broader format of retail destinations, and (iv) our shift into the foodservice and consumption market. 11 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Key Strengths,9.2.5,We have achieved a successful financial profile,"We have achieved a successful financial profile that is underpinned by strong profit margins, Adjusted EBITDA margins, cash flows from operating activities, Free Cash Flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditure KPI) and Cash Conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. Between the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2023, our average profit margin (defined as profit for the year divided by revenue) was 4.3%, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.2% (including fuel), our cash flows from operating activities totalled £3,340.6 million, cumulative free cash flow was approximately £2,097 million and our average cash conversion was 68%. This strong financial performance is driven by our commitment to deliver low prices to our clients, diverse product offer, strong own-brand grocery offer, expanded convenience and foodservice offerings and well-established George-branded product categories. Our Adjusted EBITDA margins have benefitted from our cost transformation programmes, which have generated SG&A cost savings without compromising the low prices we offer our customers. We are a structurally negative working capital business driven by growth in payables, and the beneficial payment terms to suppliers versus payments received by consumers instantly on purchase. We delivered a strong net working capital performance in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, with our active working capital management, resulting in increased working capital inflows in those two years. Furthermore, we have pursued a disciplined approach to our capital expenditure over time, with the aim of maintaining and improving our real estate platform rather than opening new sites.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Together with Michael Gleeson, the Group’s chief financial officer, our executive committee provides strong, dynamic and deep, leadership. We also benefit from the long-standing experience, market expertise, business relationships and industry know-how of our shareholder, Mohsin Issa, who is leading the management team on an interim basis. As we continue to expand our footprint and achieve our business goals, we plan to take advantage of opportunities to further enhance and supplement our management talent, both from inside our organisation as well as with external candidates. We have made key investments into our digital marketing team and expect to onboard a new chief digital officer in the third quarter of 2024. Our search for a permanent chief executive officer is robust and ongoing.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Business Strategy,9.3.1,Proposition,"Our proposition strategy is about creating more reasons to shop with us than anywhere else and providing an offering that meets all of our customers’ needs under one roof. Demonstrating the strength in our offering across the store, we recently won four awards at the 2023 annual Grocer Gold Awards, including the Grocer 33 Price award for the 26th consecutive year, the ‘Own Label Range of the Year’ award for our Just Essentials product range, the ‘Consumer Initiative of the Year’ award for our Kids Eat for £1 Cafe Meals scheme and ‘Online Supermarket of the Year.’ We believe we are well established as the lowest-price full-selection retailer in the United Kingdom, and we lead the traditional grocers in terms of lowest price. Moving forward, we intend to reduce the complexity of the customer shopping experience so that we can reflect that benefit to customers’ prices where it matters most in our value proposition. We aim to simplify our value proposition to maintain price leadership, further improve quality perception and continue to improve customer experience in-store and online. We also strive to create a more hassle-free customer experience in-store with our digital transformation. For example, we have broadened our Scan&Go services that allows customers to use a handset or the Scan&Go mobile app to scan and bag items as they shop and utilise a dedicated checkout area for quick and easy payment. We have also transformed our approach to rewarding customer loyalty through the launch of Asda Rewards in 2022, our innovative, app-based loyalty scheme that gives customers Asda pounds, not points. Customers earn cash back on their shopping, with regularly updated missions and star products enabling extra savings. Since 2022, more than 5 million of our customers enrolled in Asda Rewards and as of December 31, 2023, Asda Rewards resulted in a total of £383 million customer savings since it was first trialled. Following this initial success, we plan to look into different ways to offer even further value to our customers, “gamefy” the application and to monetise and utilise the data it provides. We believe that this approach will allow us to grow our customer analytics platform to bring better, faster and deeper customer insights to our investment decisions and to improve the overall customer experience by personalising our offer. Through Asda Rewards, we are also able to roll out seasonal offerings such as our Christmas Saver Cashpot that enabled customers save up their cash pot earnings in preparation for the festive period, with approximately 1.7 million members saving approximately £50 million into their 2023 Christmas Cashpots. We offered saving incentives where customers who transferred savings earned from their Asda Rewards cash pot into their Christmas Saver Cashpot received additional cash bonuses based upon the amount transferred. With improved availability and seasonal offerings, we continue to earn our place in customers’ minds as the retailer for key celebrations throughout the year. We believe that such rewards incentives will further drive customer loyalty and retention. In non-food, we have begun trialling a number of initiatives across clothing and general merchandise in our “lab stores.” We use the lab-store as a platform to test new technologies, concepts and ideas and assess what works for customers and colleagues. For example, we tested a “shop within a shop” concept with our Big Asda Toyshop, which had its own merchandising and look and feel, in eight stores in 2022. Following strong sales, we have rolled it out in an additional 121 stores. For Halloween in 2023, we trialled a new approach to the store entrance, creating an inviting and festive shopping environment. Through these and other concepts, we have overhauled the in-store shopping experience, radically rethinking our use of space, lighting and merchandising and are looking at how to replicate with new themes and categories on a regular basis across the portfolio. We also aim to grow Asda as a platform by forming partnerships that enable us to provide a broader set of relevant branded products and services, while also building upon our existing capabilities, such as logistics and our customer-facing ‘toyou’ proposition. We believe adding partners to our platform will result in the creation of appealing “one-stop-shop” store destinations for more customer missions. We believe these partnerships will not only provide additional income through rent and revenue share models but will also create a positive effect on our overall business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Business Strategy,9.3.2,Product,"Our goal under our product strategy is to make desirable products affordable. We aim to modernise our brand and deliver the best value to our customers, helping them fulfil their money saving goals without needing to compromise on quality. 13 ----- We began our product transformation in 2022 with the overhaul of our opening price point range, Just Essentials by Asda. This line is a key part of our strategy to make desirable products that are affordable. In 2023, we also locked in the price of over 500 popular products until the end of the summer to give customers certainty around their budgets. We delivered three key price drops in 2023, lowering the prices on over 800 high volume lines, including in October 2023 where we lowered prices by an average of 14% on many of our popular products. We will look to continue dropping prices where possible and aim to pass price drops straight onto customers where we can. As inflation is starting to ease in certain areas, we are working with our suppliers and IPL to ensure our customers feel the benefit of those reductions. As part of this brand reset, we are also focused on our mid-tier value and range offerings, investing throughout our own brand offering to drive customers to reappraise us on quality. We launched our new scratch cooking and meal solutions ranges and have introduced new own-label meal solutions brands, including Health Menu, Take-Out Club, the Indian-inspired Bom Bahia and pan-Asian-inspired House of Yum ranges, and Bistro, a selection of hearty pub-style favourites. These ranges are designed to compete directly with the likes of M&S Gastropub and takeaway brands, a key opportunity as customers switch to at-home spending amidst cost-of-living pressures. We launched ambitious quality and taste match campaigns during 2023 to demonstrate our confidence in the quality and value of our products, including Harrod’s blind taste test products and M&S Taste Match campaign across a range of popular household items. In the M&S Taste Match campaign, hundreds of our products were voted “as tasty” or “tastier than” their M&S equivalents, but at a lower cost, in a blind taste testing conducted by Cambridge Market Research. Foodservice and chilled categories also represent an avenue for growth and are important in moving the dial on customers’ quality perception. A strong proposition in these categories is essential for fulfilling our ambition of becoming a key market player in the convenience market. In non-food, we launched ‘Exclusively at George’ in May 2023, which was dubbed the first-ever supermarket elevated fashion collection. It put a spotlight on high-quality fabrics, with a focus on both quality and style. Following the success of ‘Exclusively at George,’ we introduced the Studio Edit, which will be a permanent premium arm of the George range, with a focus on wardrobe staples, premiere fabrics and finishing touches typically found in more expensive pieces. Continuing in the elevated lifestyle space, we partnered with TV presenter and influencer Stacey Solomon to create the homeware range, ‘At Home with Stacey Solomon Exclusively for George Home’ in August 2023. We believe these lines showcase our ability to deliver high quality, highly desired products across a broad range of categories to meet our customers’ every day needs.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Business Strategy,9.3.3,Location,"As part of our location strategy, we seek to be accessible however and whenever we are needed. We believe that customers seeing Asda in new locations and new formats will help us broaden our customer base. In 2022, we made significant progress in our location strategic priority area, increasing our expansion into the convenience sector. Our core focus in our location strategy is on the successful integration of the recent Arthur Acquisition and EG UK Acquisition, which together added 472 convenience sites and petrol filling stations and 124 standalone foodservice sites to our portfolio. In September 2023, we began the conversion of the Co-op sites from Co-op branding to our Asda Express banner, implementing Asda pricing across fuel and grocery upon conversion. We completed the conversion of the remaining convenience sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in March 2024. We believe we will be able to bring Asda’s great value to even more customers across the United Kingdom by reaching new communities and shoppers with this smaller store format. In the converted Co-op sites, our Asda Express prices were an average of 6.1% cheaper than their corresponding prices under Co-op ownership. We also have further organic Asda Express openings planned to bolster our location strategy. Going forward, our focus will be on the continued integration of the Co-op sites and EG UK Business into the Asda Group and delivering synergies. Beyond our expansion into the convenience market, we plan to continue to drive growth and market share gains in the online channel through the expansion of our online grocery channel’s capacity to meet increased consumer demand. We continue to seek to optimise our online grocery operating model and further develop our already profitable economic model through the ongoing assessment of our online product range and promotions, further monetisation of our e-commerce assets, as well as other initiatives. In addition to growing our core online grocery 14 ----- business, we are targeting further growth by expanding the reach of our online platform and expanding our delivery services. We expect to provide customers with greater and more convenient access to our product range by accelerating our last-mile delivery capabilities via partnerships.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Business Strategy,9.3.4,Experience,"The goal of our experience strategy is to make shopping with us easy and enjoyable. We are focused on operational excellence, testing scalable operational innovation for end-to-end service improvement. We are currently looking at changes to further improve availability in store, improve stock flow and drive effective labour management. For example, we are trialling artificial intelligence (“AI”) cameras to identify gaps in product availability and optimise stock management in store. We believe this is an example of how AI could significantly help improve the customer experience and optimise our colleagues’ time to focus on delivering high quality service. We are also striving towards a best-in-class shopping experience that gives customers the range they desire in an environment that’s easy to navigate. Our current store design had not been updated for many years, so our near-term strategy includes modernising our stores to facilitate a better customer journey. In order to ensure our colleagues are equipped to offer a best-in-class customer experience, we are also investing in colleague hours in-store via a combination of additional temporary colleagues in stores and opportunities for existing colleagues to work over-time if they wish to. Increasing the numbers of hours being worked in store means that more colleagues are on hand to serve customers across the busy and peak periods (such as Christmas). Alongside value and choice, we believe that service is a key quality signifier for customers and impacts where they choose to shop. To help further this strategy, we also hired David Hills as our new Chief Customer Officer in September 2023, who brings a wealth of retail and grocery-sector experience to our business and will play a pivotal role in providing our shoppers a hassle-free and pleasurable experience when shopping at Asda.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Business Strategy,9.3.5,Commitment to ESG targets and building a sustainable business for the long term,"Part of our strategy is to ensure our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) commitments are fully integrated into our wider business transformation plans. We believe the sales opportunity driven by eco-active shoppers, or shoppers who are highly concerned about the environment and are actively taking actions to reduce their waste, is expected to reach approximately £2 billion across the market by the year 2027. We believe ESG is a key decision enabler for customers in deciding where to shop and that setting the right ESG plan is beneficial for our customers, colleagues and investors. Our ESG strategy is focused on four pillars: healthy and sustainable choices (providing our customers with a product mix that is healthier and with a lower environmental impact), energy and climate change mitigation (reducing our greenhouse gas emissions), nature positive (sourcing and farming which respects and restores) and waste (reducing food, product and packaging waste). In August 2023, we published our third ESG report (based on 2022 data), which provided an annual update on the progress we had made towards supporting these pillars and meeting our environmental targets and in October 2023, we received our first external assessment of our ESG strategy, with an entity score of 54 points and an overall rating of 3 (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the strongest) by the financial services ratings’ agency Sustainable Fitch. Sustainable Fitch positively assessed our human and labour rights policies, gender balanced workforce and well-defined management systems, as well as our actions to increase the share of non-high fat, salt and sugar own-brand products and improve food nutrition labelling. Obtaining this rating is part of our ongoing commitment to transparently reporting on our efforts to achieve our ESG targets. For example, we have continued to reduce our operational carbon footprint, with emissions down 8% from 2021 to 2022 and 40% from 2015 to 2022, and we believe we are well on the way to achieving our commitment to reduce emissions 50% by 2025 and reaching net zero emissions by 2040. We have committed to setting a near-term science-based carbon reduction target, including a specific Forests, Land and Agriculture (“FLAG”) target. These targets have been submitted to the Science-Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”) for validation. The proposed targets were submitted before the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition so reflect our footprint prior to these acquisitions. In terms of waste reduction, over 90% of our own brand packaging was recyclable in 2022, and we donated over 2,000 tonnes of surplus food through our charity partnerships, both reducing waste and supporting those in need during challenging times. We increased the proportion of our own-label packaging that can be recycled at the kerbside to 88% (with a further 4.7% recyclable in store) and introduced the Refill Price Guarantee on our in-store refill zones, 15 ----- guaranteeing that unpackaged products are cheaper than their packaged equivalents.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.4,History,9.4.1,,"Headquartered in Leeds, we are an omni-channel retailer across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We have built our business on listening to our diverse range of customers, offering what they need at the best value and bringing innovation to the UK market. We were founded in 1965 through the merger of the Asquith family grocery business with the Associated Dairies company in Yorkshire. Our name is derived from this historic merger, combining “Asquith” and “Dairies” to form “Asda.” Founded in the North of England, we have a rich history, heritage and culture. The Asquith family has deep ties to the grocery business, W.R. Asquith having run a butcher’s shop in Knottingley, West Yorkshire, which eventually expanded to seven shops. W.R. Asquith’s sons, Peter and Fred, went on to create the United Kingdom’s first self-service supermarket in Castleford, introducing food discounting to the UK grocery market, and eventually co-founded Asda. In parallel to the growth of the Asquith family business, a group of West Riding dairy farmers joined forces, eventually becoming Associated Dairies & Farm Stores Limited led by Arthur Stockdale. Arthur’s son, Sir Noel Stockdale, went on to co-found Asda with Peter and Fred Asquith. In 1965, we acquired GEM, a major U.S. discount retailer operating in the United Kingdom. With the addition of general merchandise to the former GEM stores, we introduced the superstore to the UK market, a landmark event in the development of UK retailing. To complement this offer, Peter Asquith also introduced the first discounted petrol filling station. By 1970, we operated over 30 stores and were poised to expand beyond our original home in the North of England. Throughout the 1970s, we grew our presence in the South of England, opening stores in Newport, Plymouth and Gosport. In 1977, we launched our “Asda Price” TV adverts, featuring the “pocket tap” which came to be the official sign language for Asda. By the end of the 1970s, we were operating over 80 stores and opened our 100[th] store in 1981. Throughout the 1980s, we focused on expanding our distribution capabilities, opening seven new distribution centres strategically located throughout the United Kingdom by 1985. In 1987, our flagship Watford store opened, another landmark in UK retailing, and featured the longest-ever checkout bank at the time, with 45 checkouts. In 1988, we opened our headquarters in Leeds, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher overseeing the opening ceremonies. In 1989, George Davies was asked to produce a line of clothing for us that was high-quality, high-value and had its own identity: the pioneering George brand was born. In the 1990s, we developed the Asda Way of Working, an innovative framework for a new organisational structure that focuses on our stores and promotes colleague involvement, which set the stage for the Asda culture of today. In 1996, we opened our first Asda Pharmacy location in Harrogate, North Yorkshire and launched our “Tickled Pink” campaign to raise money for the fight against breast cancer, a partnership that continues to this day. In 1998, we began our online retail operations with a dedicated depot in Croydon. In 1999, we joined the Walmart family, becoming part of the world’s largest retailer. Throughout the early 2000s, we continued to grow and innovate, expanding our online and Click & Collect offers, opening our first Asda Living store and our first Eco Store, winning awards for the value we offer customers as well as for the positive environment we create for colleagues, launching our Free From and Extra Special offers, launching stand-alone PFSs as well as Asda Opticians. In 2015, we celebrated our 50[th] birthday and George’s 25[th] birthday. Asda has continued to innovate, including the United Kingdom’s first parcel tower, which allows customers to collect online orders in less than 60 seconds, and voice-activated shopping through Google Home. 16 ----- In October 2020, the Issa Brothers and TDR Capital reached an agreement with Walmart to acquire a majority stake in Asda, with Walmart retaining an equity interest in the business. Following regulatory approval, the deal closed in February 2021 and our new owners were able to take operational control in June 2021. In October 2022, we took our first significant step into the convenience market and acquired 116 convenience sites from the Co-operative Group (“Co-op”) as part of the Arthur Acquisition, expanding our community-focused reach of retail destinations and petrol filling station driving footfall in strategic locations at the heart of residential areas. On October 31, 2023, we greatly expanded our footprint in the convenience market and completed the purchase of the majority of the EG UK business for total cash consideration of £2.1 billion (including transaction fees), adding a total of 480 sites to our portfolio (consisting of 356 petrol filling stations, two of which have since closed, and 124 foodservice sites) through the EG UK Acquisition. In March 2024, we completed the conversion of the acquired Co-op sites and EG UK Business sites to Asda Express. We look forward to exciting prospects in this new market, including the expansion of the Asda Express convenience format to new locations. Our values are rooted in service to our customers, respect for the individual, striving for excellence and acting with integrity.

The EG UK Business is a fuel, grocery and foodservice retailer operating throughout the United Kingdom and was acquired for an enterprise value £2.07 billion on a cash-free, debt-free basis. The final proceeds at the point of acquisition were £2.1 billion (including transaction fees) and comprised: - £401 million of equity from the Group’s shareholders in the form of a subordinated shareholder loan; - the Private Placement Facility; - £646 million of proceeds from a sale and leaseback transaction of 24 stores completed in August 2023, with a further store that completed in November 2023 (the “2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions”); - a bridge loan of £290 million (the “America Bridge Loan”); and - £88 million of cash on balance sheet.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,9,SUMMARY,9.9,Recent Developments,9.9.3,Current Trading,"_The unaudited preliminary financial results presented below are derived from the Group’s unaudited management accounts. This information has not been audited or reviewed, nor have any procedures been performed_ 19 ----- _by the Group’s independent auditors with respect thereto, and it has not been prepared with a view towards compliance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on it, and no opinion or any other form of assurance is provided with respect thereto. The Group’s unaudited preliminary financial results are based upon a number of assumptions and judgments that are subject to inherent uncertainties and are subject to change, and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement of the Group’s financial or operational results for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024. Although the Group believes the management estimates and unaudited preliminary financial information and the assumptions on which they are based to be reasonable, the Group’s actual results as of and for the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 to be published in the coming months may vary from the information contained below and such variations could be material._ Based on preliminary management accounts, we estimate that our revenue (excluding fuel) for the threemonth period ended March 31, 2024 was £5,305 million (of which we estimate £5,109 million was attributable to the standalone Asda business (excluding acquisitions), £65 million was attributable to sales from the Arthur Business and £131 million was attributable to sales from the EG UK Business), an increase of £210 million, or 4%, compared to £5,095 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023 (of which £5,012 million was attributable to the standalone Asda business (excluding acquisitions) and £83 million was attributable to sales from the Arthur Business, which were not consolidated into the Group results until May 30, 2023 when the CMA lifted its Initial Enforcement Order in connection with the Arthur Acquisition). Asda standalone sales excluding fuel have increased by 1.9% yearover-year, with like-for-like growth of 0.5%. This overall increase was driven in part by investments made into our proposition, including as a result of the Aldi and Lidl Price Match programme, Fab 5 and mega deals driving improvements in price perception. We also benefited from non-food sales, which grew faster than the Asda group as a whole and faster than the market. The grocery market continues to be very competitive and overall our sales growth, excluding fuel, was slower than the market in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, partly reflecting slower than market growth in our inflation. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, we estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA was £254 million, an increase of £48 million, or 23%, from £206 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. For the three month-period ended March 31, 2024, we estimate that £7 million of Adjusted EBITDA was attributable to the Arthur Business, £35 million of Adjusted EBITDA was attributable to the EG UK Business and £ (17) million was attributable to the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and 2023 Ground Rent Transaction. For the three-month period ended March 31, 2023, £16 million of Adjusted EBITDA was attributable to the Arthur Business. This overall increase was supported by improved year-over-year trading margins and disciplined cost control, with Adjusted EBITDA margins (excluding fuel) increasing by 0.70 percentage points year-over-year to 4.8% in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, from 4.1% in the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. Fuel margins were slightly lower in the period in the standalone Asda business, as well as in the EG UK Business and the Arthur Business, as cost prices rose significantly while retail prices did not increase as quickly. We believe this overall growth in the Group’s Adjusted EBITDA is mainly driven by recovering gross margin, including a strong performance in our clothing line and our ability to control costs, which highlights the resilience of our business model. We believe in continued investment in price, particularly as inflation softens, which could boost consumers discretionary spending. We expect utility costs to begin to decline year-on-year from April 2024. We continue to integrate the EG UK Business and the Arthur Business and expect to crystallise synergies. We closed the three-month period ended March 31, 2024, with cash balance of approximately £1 billion with a strong underlying Cash Conversion. Our Adjusted Net Cash Flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA minus capex (excluding Project Future capex) plus/minus change in net working capital minus Project Future costs (including Future capex) minus net financing costs plus proceeds from disposals minus other and debt repayment plus cashflows Arthur Acquisition and EG UK Acquisition) was negative £32 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2024 as compared to negative £157 million in the three-month period ended March 31, 2023. Ongoing positive momentum on the net working capital with improving payment terms, particularly on fuel and on inventory management further helped improve our cash generation. 20 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

(3) Like-for-like sales growth is a measure of annual growth of sales calculated as current year comparable sales excluding fuel (excluding VAT) versus prior year comparable sales. Current year comparable sales includes all revenue except fuel sales, sales generated from stores in the first twelve complete calendar months following opening, sales generated from stores that have permanently closed, sales generated from stores that have been temporarily closed for more than two consecutive calendar months within the previous twelve full calendar months, financial services commissions, ‘toyou.’ Sales are net of Asda Rewards earned and other discounts. (4) Based upon the Kantar Worldpanel (Take Home Panel –Till Roll – Spend as of the 12 weeks ended January 21, 2024) grocery market share for the 12 weeks ended December 26, 2021, December 25, 2022 and December 24, 2023, respectively. (5) Calculated as the total number of individual transactions in-store during the year (excludes transactions at stores from the EG UK Acquisition and Arthur Acquisition). (6) Represents the proportion of food sales initiated by customers digitally (including all online grocery and click and collect sales and transactions initiated from a computer or mobile device) but specifically excluding brick-and-mortar sales executed by customers using mobile payment or scan and go (excludes fuel sales and sales at stores from the EG UK Acquisition and Arthur Acquisition). (7) Represents the number of customers using Asda Rewards in the last 30 days, based upon a rolling four-week average, as at December 31, 2022 and 2023. Asda Rewards was launched in 2022 so there is no comparative value for 2021 (excludes customers at stores from the EG UK Acquisition and Arthur Acquisition).

(C) Prior year ATM rates adjustment reflects the removal of income that has been included in EBITDA following a change in the assessment of business rates for automated teller machines (“ATMs”). (D) The restructuring adjustments comprise one off provisions relating to (i) facilities management restructuring, in-store bakery proposition restructuring, management and back office restructure and closure of Heston & Dartford depots totalling £30.6 million in 2021, (ii) facilities management restructuring and retail admin colleague restructuring totalling £4.7 million in 2022 and (iii) Night-to-twilight shift re-organisation, head office colleague restructure, livings and post office closures totalling £17.4 million in 2023. (E) Tax saving pass through adjustment reflects the pass through to Walmart of tax deductions relating to adjustments to the carrying value of the loan from Asda Stores Limited to the ASDA Group Pension Scheme which was part of the financing of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme buy-in. These tax deductions were passed through to Walmart under the terms of the LBO Transaction. (F) The legal settlement in 2023 relates to a net credit received as a result of settling historical legal cases. This credit recognized is net of amounts which were passed through to Walmart under the terms of the original LBO Acquisition. (G) The Group acquired Arthur Foodstores Ltd, a carve-out of 132 convenience sites from the Co-operative Group as part of the Arthur Acquisition, in October 2022. The Arthur Acquisition was subject to an Initial Enforcement Order by the CMA and it therefore was deemed that the Group did not have control according to the principles defined in IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements in order to consolidate the results into the Group in the year ended December 31, 2022. With respect to the year ended December 31, 2022, the Group includes actual Adjusted EBITDA related to the trading performance of the Arthur Business since the closing of the transaction on October 30, 2022 as if the trading performance of the Arthur Business had been consolidated from October 30, 2022 in Adjusted EBITDA without giving effect to any annualization. With respect to the year ended December 31, 2023, results for the Arthur Acquisition have been included in the Group’s consolidated results from May 30, 2023 when the Initial Enforcement Order was lifted by the CMA. An adjustment has been made to Adjusted EBITDA for the year-ended December 31, 2023 to give effect to Adjusted EBITDA of the Arthur Business from January 1, 2023 through May 30, 2023 as if the trading performance of the Arthur Business had been consolidated from January 1, 2023. No further adjustment has been made to reflect the annualisation of the impact of 13 sites that were disposed in December 2023 and January 2024, as required as remedies to the CMA’s investigation into the Arthur Acquisition; see below adjustment (T) in relation to the year ended December 31, 2023. (H) Prior to the LBO Acquisition, ASDA Stores Limited provided retirement benefits for eligible employees through two defined benefit plans in the UK, including one funded, the ASDA Group Pension Scheme (the “Scheme”). On July 9, 2021, the trustees of the Scheme completed a full buy-out of the Scheme. To the extent that the Scheme was unable to make repayments of principal amounts outstanding on the buy-in loan out of Scheme assets, ASDA Stores Limited was obliged to make a contribution to the Scheme to the value of the shortfall. The pension buyout loss reflects the difference between the net carrying amount of Scheme assets and liabilities and the recoverable amount of the buy-in loan at the date of buyout, after accounting for a net actuarial loss of £13.9 million. For more details see note 20 to the 2021 Financial Statements. (I) The ARO provision release adjustment removes the accounting gain recorded in EBITDA relating to the release of an asset retirement provision as a result of remeasuring the asset retirement obligation liability due to changes in the discount rate. (J) At completion of the Arthur Acquisition in October 2022, Asda entered into an Outsourcing and Interim Franchise Agreement (“OIFA”) with Co-op. Under the terms of the OIFA, Co-op provided outsourced management services for the Arthur Business sites. These services included providing the workforce to operate the sites, area management teams, the supply and fulfilment of grocery inventory and IT services. These services were provided during the period of the CMA review and up until the stores were handover to Asda management and re-branded as Asda Express. Under the terms of the OIFA, Arthur paid a management fee to Co-op based on a percentage of revenue. Other advisor and integration fees adjustment relate to the non-recurring payments made under the OIFA arrangements, non-recurring third-party advisor fees to support the independent management team and other non-recurring third-party advisor fees incurred by the Group. (K) In 2021, the one-off acquisition costs incurred relating to the LBO Acquisition relate to third party advisor fees and stamp duty paid in relation to the acquisition in the prior period of the entire issued share capital of Asda Group Limited. In 2022, the one-off acquisition costs incurred relating to the Arthur Acquisition relate to third party advisor fees in relation to the acquisition in the prior period of the entire issued share capital of Arthur Foodstores Limited. In 2023, the one-off acquisition costs incurred relating to the EG UK Acquisition relate to third party advisor fees in relation to the acquisition in the prior period of the entire issued share capital of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited. (L) The one-off separation costs adjustment removes the incremental costs incurred to support the separation from Walmart. These costs include IT related and non-IT related costs. Since the LBO Acquisition, the Group has embarked on a programme, Project Future, to separate its IT systems from its previous owner Walmart. The separation programme is one-off and non-recurring in nature, and will transition the Group to a standalone IT infrastructure using software as a service from digital partners. (M) All share-based payment liabilities issued prior to the LBO Acquisition were settled during the year ended December 31, 2021. The share option programmes allowed Group employees to acquire shares of the former ultimate parent company of Asda Group Limited – Walmart Inc. These awards were granted by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The fair value of options granted was initially measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees became unconditionally entitled to payment. The charge was recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value of the share options was measured based on an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The liability was re-measured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value were recognised in the consolidated income statement during the vesting period. These share-based payment transactions were accounted for as cash-settled. 37 ----- (N) Options in Walmart shares have historically been awarded to employees of the Group; these share option awards were accounted for within EBITDA as cash settled equity awards. Share award schemes were all existing options in Walmart shares and were settled in 2021, the corresponding charges have since fallen away and, as a result, are added back for the year ended December 31, 2021 (£17.5 million). Since then, the Group has, however, enhanced other colleague incentive programmes. The estimated annual incremental cost of these enhanced incentive programmes was estimated to be £16 million in 2021. Therefore, a charge of £16.0 million has been included for year ended December 31 2021. In subsequent periods, this incremental investment in colleague incentive programmes is considered to be an underlying cost of the business and therefore, no adjustments are made in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023. (O) The ground rent charge relates to payments in connection with servicing the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction. (P) The Starbucks rental income adjustment reflects the recognition of rental income from the Starbucks freehold properties acquired as part of the EG UK Acquisition. This adjustment represents rental income for two months since closing of the transaction recognized on a straight-line basis. (Q) In connection with the EG UK Acquisition, the Group entered into a number of arrangements with EG Finco Limited, including the TSA and an integration support arrangement. These arrangements were all negotiated concurrently with the acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited, they are interdependent with the terms of the acquisition, and were negotiated as a single transaction. Under the TSA, a subsidiary of EG Finco Limited will provide Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited and its subsidiaries with IT and other centralized services for an initial term of two years. During this initial term, these services are provided at £nil cost to the Group, subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, EG Finco Limited has also agreed for a period of two years to reimburse the Group for certain centralized costs which transferred as part of the transaction perimeter and are required to support the acquired business. This arrangement is not considered to be part of the business combination under IFRS 3R and therefore, £27.3 million of the consideration transferred to EG Finco Limited has been allocated to the TSA arrangement based on the fair value of the services provided subsidiaries of EG Finco Limited and the estimated costs to be recharged by the Group to EG Finco Limited. This has been recognised within prepayments and will be recognized within operating expenses in the consolidated income statement over the initial two-year term of the TSA. The TSA prepayment unwind adjustment reflects an adjustment for the amortization of the prepayment recognized in EBITDA since closing of the transaction. (R) Under the integration support arrangement, the Group and EG Finco Limited entered into an agreement whereby EG Finco Limited would support the costs associated with the integration of the acquisition by the Group for a fixed amount of £11.3 million over two years with the payments made quarterly. The full amount has been recorded as an adjustment to the purchase consideration and recognized within Other Debtors at closing in the consolidated balance sheet. The integration payment reflects the recording of this payment within EBITDA on a straight-line basis. (S) In 2022, management shares in the immediate parent company of the Group, Bellis Midco 4 Limited, were issued to eligible members of senior management employed by the Group as part of a Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) in exchange for proceeds determined by an independent calculation of fair value at the issue date. The MIP add-back reflects adjustment to add back the related share-based payment charge under IFRS 2 for the year ended December 31, 2023. (T) The adjustment for the Arthur Acquisition impact of CMA disposals relates to the annualisation of the impact of 13 sites that were disposed in December 2023 and January 2024, as required as remedies to the CMA’s investigation into the Arthur Acquisition. (U) Represents the targeted synergies from the Arthur Acquisition that are expected to be delivered within two years of completion. These synergies are related to the anticipated benefits of increased volume and margin benefits which we believe we can achieve through our value leadership, scale, supplier relationships and operational efficiencies. (V) Represents the adjustment to annualise LTM EBITDA for the acquisition of America. The EG UK Acquisition closed on October 31, 2023 and the results of the EG UK Business were consolidated into our results from that date. This adjustment reflects £164 million of EBITDA attributed to the EG UK Business from January 1, 2023 to October 31, 2023, which represents the actual performance of the acquired perimeter for that period. (W) Represents the targeted synergies resulting for the EG UK Acquisition expected to be delivered within two years of completion A large portion of the synergies are expected to flow into gross profit as sales grow and buying benefits materialise. These synergies are comprised of (i) £44 million related to fuel, £24 million related to grocery and merchandise and £1 million related to foodservice. We expect the Fuel synergies to stem from price investments and an uplift in EG volumes, fuel cost price reductions, fuel card commercial terms improvements, joint buying benefits and merchant cost savings. We expect grocery and retail synergies to come from price investments and an uplift in EG volumes, range optimisations, in-store marketing income, other monetisation of customer data, best cost price switching and buying benefits. We expect foodservice synergies to come from an enhanced foodservice proposition, our in-store foodservice outlets at our grocery sites and the introduction of new foodservice sites leveraging our vacant tenancy portfolio. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—We may from time to time pursue acquisitions, which may prove more costly than anticipated and may not generate anticipated synergies and which may have an adverse impact on our business, as could our failure to successfully integrate such businesses following acquisition. Our business could also be negatively impacted by merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by supranational and national laws and regulations.”_ (X) Sale and leaseback rent store assets annualisation adjustments relate to the annualisation of rent costs and servicing costs associated with the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions as if the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions had completed on January 1, 2023. (Y) Ground rent annualisation adjustments relate to the annualisation of rent costs and servicing costs associated with the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction as if the Ground Rent Transaction Facility Agreement was in place on January 1, 2023. 38 ----- (4) Free Cash Flow is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditure KPI.

The primary reason for the difference in capital expenditure and Capital Expenditure KPI is due to the timing of when the assets are paid for. There are timing differences between the two measures due to internal capital expenditure being presented on an accrual basis.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.1,"Risks Relating to Our General Operations We operate in a highly competitive industry and our business, financial condition and results operations, as well as the strength of our brand, may be materially adversely affected by actions of our competitors and our failure to respond to competitive pressures.","In the highly competitive grocery retail industry, success depends on satisfying changing customer needs more effectively than the competition. Failure to meet consumer demands is a competitive disadvantage and we may therefore be exposed to a loss of market share. There can be no assurance that we can continue to successfully compete with existing competitors or new market entrants. Our competition generally includes international and domestic brick-and-mortar retailers (including, generalist grocers, supermarket chains, discount retailers, grocery specialists and convenience stores), some of which also operate omni-channel businesses such as Amazon, as well as online pure players, such as Ocado. In recent years, the historically stable grocery retail market in the United Kingdom has undergone a structural shift towards discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl, convenience formats and online retailers, to the detriment of traditional supermarkets and hypermarkets. We generally compete for, among other things, customers, market share, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of the business with many other local, regional, national and global omni-channel retailers, wholesale operators and retail intermediaries. Our competitors generally compete with us on the basis of, among other things, price, quality, selection, availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, shopping convenience, brand reputation, overall shopping experience, attractiveness and ease of use of our online platforms, cost and delivery speed of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. In executing our strategy, we may face a variety of competitive challenges, including, among others: - potential emergence of new competitors, including foreign and domestic retailers entering our markets, or consolidation, strengthening or expanded offerings of existing operators, as has been the case in recent years with the emergence of discounters (for more information, see “Industry” and “Business—Key _Strengths”);_ - potential creation by competitors of new store formats, additional convenience grocery retail store offerings, in-store or online services, delivery and pick-up options, loyalty and reward schemes or online platforms that customers may prefer; - the risk of our competitors successfully adopting our business model in their own stores; - competitive pressure on product pricing from core competitors, as well as increasing competition from discounters and online retailers; 41 ----- - the risk of our competitors providing better service, quality, value or availability of products; and - the risk of our competitors better utilising customer data to provide personalised and efficient services, including better loyalty and reward schemes and preferred pricing for loyalty and reward schemes’ members. The performance of our competitors and changes in their pricing, promotions, product mix or other business strategies, and our response (or failure to respond) to such competitive pressures, may lead to lower sales revenue, higher operating expenses and/or lower profit margins and may require a significant amount of management attention and resources, which may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our ongoing business operations. There can be no assurance that, with evolving customer preferences, our customers will not shift towards competitors with a different business model. Even in geographies, channels and formats where we have a strong retail presence, we face the risk that new retail market entrants may attempt to gain market share through pricing pressure. For example, the UK grocery retail market has seen the rapid growth of discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and Lidl) that compete through differentiation on price coupled with a more limited selection of own-brand products. We experience downward pricing pressure, and if we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience additional downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced retail margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In recent years, and in particular during the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for online shopping services has increased substantially and many of our competitors have expanded their online offerings. If our competitors are able to offer faster or cheaper deliveries, and/or more convenient delivery options, we could lose current or potential customers, our brand and reputation could suffer, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and enhance our online offering and the information systems that support our online activities, as well as continue to optimise our logistics and distribution capabilities. This may require the acquisition of equipment and software and the development, either internally or through third-parties of new proprietary software and logistics and distribution solutions. In addition, any impairment of or disruption to our supply chain or delivery fleet could result in a disruption in the delivery of our products to our online customers, which could harm our brand and could generate additional costs. Furthermore, the online grocery industry in the United Kingdom may not sustain or improve upon current levels of demand, and we may fail to develop our online retail proposition to successfully appeal to a broader customer base and sustain current growth rates. If we are unable to effectively compete with our online competitors or if we fail to retain and attract online customers, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we may fail to successfully compete with the growing convenience retail market, despite our growing presence is such market. If we are unable to successfully expand our operations into the convenience retail market and the convenience retail market continues to grow, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.2,"We may be unable to manage risks relating to health and safety, sourcing, food safety and customer expectations for both food and non-food products and in our stores and premises, which increases the risk of injury or loss of life, reputational damage, and decreased customer confidence.","Food and product safety and food hygiene and traceability (including in respect of product origins, freshness and conditions of preservation through the supply chain) are top priorities for us: the actual safety of the food and other products and services we offer, as well as the public’s perception of that safety, are essential to our business, brand and reputation. Any event, such as a significant product recall or negative press reaction to statements made or actions taken could damage our brand or reputation or cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of the products we sell. We are also subject to a number of food safety and hygiene regulations. See “Business— _Regulation—Food Safety, Hygiene, Labelling and Nutrition and Consumer Protection.” Failures to comply with these_ regulations could result in a number of adverse consequences, including fines, loss of licences, costs of compliance or certification requirements. We may not be able to ensure that our customers always enjoy safe, quality products. We sell food for human consumption, which subjects us to safety risks such as contamination (including the presence of an undeclared 42 ----- allergen, a foreign object, substance, unintentional microbe or chemical, other agent or residue or the introduction of a genetically modified organism, and other types of contamination caused by the presence of pests that are inherent to the product in question or present where such product may be stored), spoilage, mislabelling, expired products and product tampering, all of which could lead to product withdrawals or recalls or destruction of inventory and could result in bad publicity, temporary store or warehouse closures and substantial costs in connection with compliance or remediation. There is also a risk that products may not be sourced in a responsible or sustainable way. We may also be impacted by any assertion that our products have caused illness or injury, whether true or false, proven or unproven. We could also be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury stemming from product contamination, spoilage, mislabelling, expired products, product tampering or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of our products. From time to time we also recall products. Risks to the health of our customers can also arise from our branded and own label suppliers, some of whom are third parties who operate outside of our direct control, in relation to the ingredients, foods and products we sell in our stores. For example, we rely on suppliers, some of whom are third parties who operate outside of our control, for ingredients, foods and products we sell in our stores. Our use of third-party suppliers increases the risk that any of the aforementioned types of incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations could be affected. In addition, food or product safety-related risks may also occur under any one of our own-brand labels and we may be impacted by negative publicity regarding any assertion that our food or other products have resulted in illness or injury. Our customers expect that we will provide them with a large selection of safe, high-quality products. Our colleagues are critical to maintaining our customer and supplier relationships and ultimately protecting our reputation as a business. If we are unable to control and guarantee the quality of the products we sell, especially our own-brand products and in-store services, our brand and reputation may be negatively impacted. We rely upon electrical power to operate all our facilities across our distribution network. To attain maximum performance, these types of facilities must often operate on a continuous basis and at the appropriate pre-set temperatures. As a result, any shortage or interruption in power supply may result in food spoilage and any extended power supply shortages or interruptions could result in perishable food losses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Actual recent increases and potential future increases in wholesale energy prices may result in an increase in our costs incurred to maintain adequate and constant power supply at our facilities. Cold chain requirements, setting out the temperatures at which our ingredients and products must be stored and transported, are established both by law and by us to help guarantee the safety of our food products. Our cold chain must be maintained from the moment the ingredients arrive at, or are frozen by, our suppliers, through transportation and ultimately to the time of sale in our stores or delivery to our customers. In the past, the United Kingdom has experienced shortages of CO2 due to the temporary shutdown of fertilizer manufacturing facilities of which CO2 is a by-product and is an important component of our cold chain. CO2 is also used in the preparation of some of the foods and beverages we produce or we otherwise buy from suppliers, for sale in our stores and in the refrigeration technologies of some of the sites we acquired. A failure in our cold chain could lead to food spoilage, risks to the health of our customers, fines and other penalties and damage to our brand and reputation, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Consumers are increasingly focused on the traceability of food products to assist them in deciding what to purchase. In January 2013, incidents of horse meat in parts of the European food supply chain mislabelled as beef were identified, negatively impacting retailers and producers throughout Europe, including Asda, and led to additional standards, such as BRC standards on traceability, food fraud and food defence. While we conduct quality practices and procedures, it may be difficult to detect contamination, spoilage, mislabelling, product tampering or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of our products, particularly fraudulent or malicious activity. Adverse publicity about these types of problems, whether valid or not, may discourage customers from buying our products or may affect our brand and reputation. Our actual or perceived sale of unsafe food products could result in product liability claims, a loss of customer confidence, product recalls and legal claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. A significant lawsuit, widespread product recall or other events leading to the loss of customer confidence in the safety and quality of our products could damage our brand and reputation and negatively impact our sales, profitability and prospects for growth. Further, if a product recall is required in circumstances where the financial consequences are not covered by the relevant supplier or our insurance, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Although we maintain product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will 43 ----- be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Even if future product liability claims against us are unsuccessful, these claims could be costly and time-consuming and may divert our management’s time and resources from operating our business and may harm our brand and reputation. We also face additional risks from product defects in relation to the sale of our non-food products, including, for example, the risks of battery explosions, appliance malfunction or toys or other items that prove to be dangerous. If products we purchase from our suppliers are damaged or defective, we may not be able to return products to these suppliers and obtain refunds on our purchase price or obtain indemnification from them for any damages caused. Our brand and reputation could be damaged by the marketing of such dangerous or defective products, especially in case of serious defects, such as products containing harmful substances, causing death, physical harm or other health problems. In addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by us or by our suppliers could occur, which could lead to investigation by agencies responsible for customer product safety. In all such cases, especially if there is a prolonged impact on product quality, our brand and reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Certain risks are inherent in the operation of foodservice, serve-over and self-serve counters and our brand and reputation could be damaged to the extent the quality of these facilities fall below our established standards. For example, if particular temperatures and environments are not properly maintained, food safety could be compromised and dangerous bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or Listeria monocytogenes could develop, which could cause harm to our customers and ultimately impact our reputation. Additionally, these facilities are also subject to public tampering and contamination, over which we have limited control. Even if our products are not affected by contamination or other incidents that compromise their safety and quality, we are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by widespread contamination, widespread diseases (such as H1N1, SARS, MERS, BSE, COVID and avian influenza) and evolving nutritional and health-related concerns. Regulatory authorities may limit the supply of certain types of food products in response to public health concerns, and customers may perceive certain products to be unsafe or unhealthy, which could require us or our suppliers to find alternative ingredients or products that may not be available at commercially reasonable prices or within acceptable time constraints. In addition, such governmental regulations may require us to identify replacement products for our customers or, alternatively, to discontinue certain offerings or limit the range of product offerings. We may be unable to find substitutes that are as appealing to our customers, or such substitutes may not be widely available or may be available only at increased costs. Such substitutions or limitations could also reduce demand for our products. Each of the factors above may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.3,"Our business is dependent on the economic situation in the United Kingdom and we are exposed to local, regional, national and global economic, political, social and other trends that could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.","General economic conditions in the United Kingdom and globally may adversely affect our financial performance. Higher interest rates, fluctuating petroleum product prices (including crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, and diesel fuel), higher costs for raw materials as well as electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market, inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in disposable income, reduced access to customer credit, higher customer debt levels, changes in customer spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of new taxes or other changes in tax laws, state-implemented austerity measures, other regulatory changes, the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other UK or global economic factors could materially adversely affect customer demand for the products we sell, cause us to change the mix of products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases of goods, adversely affect our revenue and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and results of operations and could result in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other non-current assets. 44 ----- In addition to the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting in higher transportation, labour, insurance costs, fuel, energy or commodity prices, inflation, and other economic factors could increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, following the easing of COVID-19 lockdown measures across the United Kingdom in the first half of 2021, the increase in economic activity has led to increased pressure across global supply chains, including in relation to labour shortages within the food manufacturing supply chain (including shortages of heavy goods vehicle (“HGV”) drivers), which have resulted in wage inflation; a lack of container capacity within global shipping, which has resulted in an increase in global shipping rates; increases in wholesale energy prices; shortages of certain raw materials (including CO2) and increases in commodity prices, which have resulted in input price inflation within the supply chain. Unfavourable economic conditions or economic, social or political uncertainty globally or in the United Kingdom could significantly adversely affect our revenue, growth and profitability and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or ability to implement our strategy. As a UK business, we are particularly affected by the economic, political and social conditions prevailing from time to time in the United Kingdom. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain our current profit levels if adverse economic, political and social events or circumstances occur in the United Kingdom. See also “—The _occurrence of catastrophic events, such as war, terrorist attacks, civil unrest, disruptive geopolitical events, epidemics, pandemics and natural disasters, could materially adversely affect our and our suppliers’ (including other third parties on which we rely) business, financial condition and results of operations.” Recent increases in rates of_ inflation and house prices in the United Kingdom, forecasted further increases in such inflation rates and house prices and central banks’ responses to those increases, as well as other changes in economic conditions could impact consumer spending, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or ability to implement our strategy. Economic downturns create increased pressure on margins for all retailers, including us, and a significant economic downturn in the United Kingdom, or the impact of the current cost living crisis, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inflationary or deflationary pressures on the products we sell could also impact our net sales and earnings, and during financial years 2022 and 2023, we experienced levels of inflation that are higher than we have experienced in recent years. If the cost of goods changes as a result of inflation, we may be unable to adjust our retail prices accordingly, which could adversely impact our sales or earnings. While we actively seek to manage our selling prices and production costs, volumes, inventories and working capital, future changes in economic conditions in the United Kingdom could result in short-term and long-term decreases in consumer confidence and demand, increases in selling prices and production costs or the volatility of raw material prices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our suppliers and their respective businesses, whether in the United Kingdom or abroad, may also be adversely affected by the same, similar or other economic, political and social factors that affect our operations, which could result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing certain goods in the volume typically available to us for sale or at all. For example and as a result of Brexit, we are faced with higher risks with regards to getting our products into the 18 stores we operate in Northern Ireland. See “Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters—We are subject to regulations relating to the _implementation of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.”_ In addition, our business is affected by unstable economic and political conditions and geopolitical conflicts, such as the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and escalating conflict in the Middle East (including tensions in the Red Sea and between Israel and Iran). Whilst we are unable to forecast the long-term impact that this war will have, according to the Bank of England, inflationary pressures intensified sharply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The Bank of England indicated that this has led to a material deterioration in the outlook for the world and UK growth and has exacerbated the combination of adverse supply shocks that the United Kingdom and other countries continue to face. The war in Ukraine and related sanctions have pushed up the cost of oil and other key commodities. Moreover, this war could lead to additional market and other disruptions, including significant volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, supply chain, labour and logistics interruptions, an increased risk of food availability and integrity, as well as food fraud issues, increased wholesale prices, political and social instability, changes in consumer or purchaser preferences as well as increase in cyberattacks and espionage. These factors have resulted in an increase 45 ----- in our transportation costs for distribution, utility costs for our stores and costs to purchase products from our suppliers and may make it more difficult to maintain our low prices or may result in decreased footfall at our stores or decreased traffic for our online business. As a result of the war in Ukraine, Europe is experiencing an energy crisis. For example, Russia’s closure of the Nord Stream pipeline in September 2022 has threatened a large percentage of the European Union’s natural gas supplies, which has led to energy price increases and could lead to shortages on the global energy market. Whilst some costs such as energy prices may ultimately abate, there remains considerable uncertainty and the potential for price volatility as a result of the war in Ukraine and conflict in the Middle East (including as a result of tensions in the Red Sea) which is likely to continue to impact consumer confidence and commodity prices. Inflationary pressures arising from the ongoing war in Ukraine and energy crisis have contributed to a rise in the cost of living and a reduction in disposal income for consumers. Our revenue and profitability are influenced by customer discretionary spending, which is influenced by the cyclical nature of the general economy, levels of unemployment, population demographics, inflationary/deflationary cycles, real disposable income, VAT increases, interest rates, the availability of customer credit and customer perception of overall economic conditions and their own economic prospects, all of which are factors beyond our control. We are actively monitoring the war in Ukraine as well as the ongoing and increasing inflationary pressures on consumer sentiment and spending and assessing its impact on our business. We expect these factors to adversely impact the financial performance of the wider grocery market as well as our performance whilst these conditions persist. We are unable to predict the nature and extent of inflationary pressures on our customers’ shopping habits and the environment in which we and our suppliers operate. The extent and duration of Russia’s war in Ukraine, sanctions and resulting market disruptions could be significant and could potentially have substantial impact on the global economy and our business for an unknown period of time. During periods of adverse economic, political and social conditions, we may also have difficulty accessing financial markets, which could make it more difficult, more expensive or impossible to obtain funding for additional investments to expand our business and operations or for refinancing, such that we may be unable to meet our debt service obligations, including on the Senior Secured Notes, or other financial obligations as they become due. Any prolonged adverse economic, political or social environment could make it difficult for us, as well as for our customers and suppliers, to maintain current revenue and profitability levels and could materially limit our growth. In the past, challenging market conditions have resulted in greater volatility and, in some cases, reduced liquidity, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in credit markets. Each of the factors above may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Our success has been founded in part on our ability to develop our brand as a leading UK retailer of quality, competitively priced grocery, clothing and general merchandise. Maintaining the reputation of and value associated with our brand is central to the success of our business. This can be an especially difficult task for retailers, particularly in light of the development of social media for advertising, including influencer marketing and brand partnerships with other third parties across the various platforms in recent years, which has led to a sharp increase in reputational risks. Any event, such as a significant product recall or negative press reaction to statements made or actions taken, or the failure to make certain statements or take certain actions, by us or our senior management (or on our behalf by advertising partners), that could damage our brand or reputation or cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of the products we sell could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our principal brand names and trademarks (such as the Asda logo) are key assets of our business. See “Business—Our Intellectual Property.” We rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws to establish and protect our intellectual property rights but cannot be certain that the actions we have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent material violation of our proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that litigation will not be necessary to enforce our trademark or proprietary rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of third parties. Adverse publicity, legal action or other factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of our brand, which could lead to decreased customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also “Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters—From time to 46 ----- _time we and/or our management are subject to claims that can result in litigation, arbitration, tax or regulatory proceedings which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability.”_ The brand names of our own-brand products also represent an important asset of our business. Certain of these own-brand items are manufactured and/or packaged by third parties, and while our policies set out quality control standards, we do not control these third parties or their quality control, employment, ethics or other business practices. If we are unable to control and guarantee the quality of our own-brand products, our reputation may be damaged, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Maintaining broad market acceptance of our own-brand items depends on many factors, including pricing, costs, quality and customer perception, and we may not achieve or maintain expected sales for our own-brand label items. See also “Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters—We rely on certain suppliers and partners, some of _which are third parties, and any failure by these suppliers and partners to comply with obligations could have a materially adverse impact on our brand, reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition and our agreements with these suppliers and partners may be subject to adjustments that could increase our expenses.”_ In light of the stringent employment, health and safety, environmental and other regulations to which we are subject and the scrutiny we face from, among others, regulators, other national or local authorities, non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders, a violation, or allegations of a violation of such laws or regulations, or a failure to achieve particular standards by any of our suppliers or manufacturers we purchase goods from, could lead to unfavourable publicity and a decline in demand for our products, or require us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our supply chain and other business arrangements to ensure compliance. Any such events concerning us or any of the manufacturers or suppliers that supply products to us could substantially erode the reputation of, or value associated with, our brands and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.

Given the varied backgrounds and tastes of our customer base, we must offer a sufficient range of products to satisfy a broad spectrum of preferences. Demand for our food products is affected by customer tastes and preferences, which are impacted by, among other things, social trends, health concerns, ethical considerations and culinary trends. Further to a review on customer and product trends, customers are increasingly focused on health and wellness, including avoiding foods with certain ingredients such as trans fats, gluten, sugar, sodium, processed wheat, animal products or other product attributes and prefer foods which fit in to their image of a healthy lifestyle. Customers have also shown increasing preference for vegan and organic products, ethically sourced products, environmentally-friendly product packaging and products that support local business. The review suggests that other food trends include foods that can be cooked with just an oven, on-the-go eating, comfort food with global influences, gourmet fast food and indulgent hybrid snack combinations. We must adapt and develop products to address these trends and preferences in a timely manner in order to remain competitive. Further, our customers increasingly expect a seamless omni-channel experience and when making a decision to purchase products from us, want to be able to have access to greater amounts of information than ever before, including on traceability, environmental sustainability and nutritional value. Likewise, our clothing, home product lines and general merchandise offer are subject to changing customer tastes in apparel and decor which are also impacted by sustainability considerations. Customers also increasingly expect to be able to interact with us in a variety of ways, such as through mobile application purchases, which require investments in technology and human resources. Customers also increasingly desire convenience and accessibility, requiring further investments to expand our footprint in the convenience market, including under our Asda Express banner. In addition, in this current economic environment, customers continue to experience cost pressures on their household budgets as they face a real wage decline, increasing the importance of value or lower margin food and non-food offerings. However, consumer patterns, which have increasingly been tending towards eating and working at home due to inflationary pressures and the increase in working from home in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic in the last three years, may reverse and an increasing number of employees may return to working from the office or an increase in dining out once 47 ----- inflationary pressures subside, which in turn may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we do not identify or effectively respond to customer trends and preferences in a timely manner, or if we fail to meet our customers’ expectations, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, our reputation, the perception of our value proposition, demand for our products and services, our market share and the growth of our business, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is difficult to quickly, consistently and successfully predict the products and services our customers will be interested in and respond to changes in their shopping patterns. Responding to shifts in customer preferences and expectations also can entail significant costs. The success of our business depends on how accurately and quickly we predict customer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed, ease and cost of delivery or collection options are of primary and increasing importance to customers, particularly as a result of the growth of digital tools and social media that inform customers. Further, if we misjudge demand for certain products, particularly for our non-food products, we may build up excess inventory for those products, which could result in a decrease in their sales price and inefficient working capital management which, if material, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Increasing attention to climate change, fuel conservation measures, alternative fuel requirements, incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources (such as electric vehicles and biofuels), increasing consumer demand for alternatives to oil and natural gas, and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our fuel and reduced revenues. Global efforts to respond to the challenges of climate change may also have an impact on the demand for the price of oil and gas moving forward, as countries increasingly shift toward alternative energy sources, which may in turn impact our revenues in the long term if we are unable to achieve or maintain a sufficiently low break-even price. In particular, the automobile industry has focused heavily on reduced fuel consumption, a trend that will likely continue with improvements to alternative fuels such as electricity, hydrogen or compressed natural gas. If customers and the automobile industry continue to embrace electric and hybrid vehicles and alternative fuels, this could have an adverse impact on our growing fuel business, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. For example, in October 2022, the European Union adopted legislation requiring a 55% CO2 emission reduction for new cars and 50% for new vans by 2030 compared to 2021 levels and for a 100% CO2 emission cut by 2035, effectively prohibiting the sale of new combustion engine cars. Should similar legislation be enacted in the United Kingdom, this could accelerate the transition of the economy away from the use of fossil fuels towards lower-or-zero-carbon emissions alternatives, which could decrease demand for, and in turn the prices of, the fuel we sell, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, institutional lenders may, of their own accord, elect not to provide or place additional restrictions on funding for fuel-linked companies based on climate change related concerns, which could affect our access to capital for potential growth projects and other financing requirements.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Our operations are subject to physical risks across all regions of operation, which include an increase in sea level and changes in weather conditions, such as rapid changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. For example, global shipping may be disrupted as a result of extreme weather patterns. 48 ----- Food production systems require a diverse range of plants, animals, bacteria and fungi, both for the direct supply of food and to sustain the underlying ecosystem processes that make agriculture possible – from water supply to soil fertility enhancement, pollination and natural pest control. Changing global weather patterns in the geographies of food production systems may negatively impact or destroy the ecosystems where products grow, in turn affecting such products’ availability and/or quality. In addition, water resources are vital to food production systems and the scarcity of such resources may have an adverse impact on agricultural production and yields. See “Business—Our _Quality Control System, Health and Safety and Environmental Policies—Our Environmental, Social and Governance Goals—Our ESG Priority Areas—Energy and Climate Mitigation.” Other climate-related issues such as adverse_ weather conditions may have a significant impact on our operations, property, supply chain (particularly in our fresh food offering) and our ability to maintain availability on our shelves. We also face transitional risks related to climate change. Developments related to climate change may expedite a transition away from the use of carbon-intensive sources for energy generation and products derived from certain fossil fuels, which could have a material and adverse effect on us if we are not able to demonstrate that our products align with a low-carbon transition or we are not able to meet our carbon transition targets. As a retailer, we recognise that we have a responsibility to minimise the adverse impact that our business activities have on the environment. Failure to do this may result not only in adverse environmental impacts, but also financial penalties and long-term damage to our reputation. As the global climate crisis becomes more critical, there is a risk that we will fail to address climate-related impacts on our business in reputational, operational and financial terms and may not meet stakeholder expectations. In addition, we are subject to legislation and regulation regarding climate change and the emission of greenhouse gases including with respect to our supply chain, and compliance with related rules could be difficult and costly. We could incur increased energy, environmental and other costs and capital expenditures to comply with existing or new greenhouse gas emission laws and regulations. Failure to comply with any such laws and regulations could result in penalties as well as adverse consequences to our reputation and image among our customers and stakeholders. The realisation of any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Such events could result in closure of, physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our and our suppliers’ (including other third parties on which we rely) properties, limitations on operating hours, workforce shortages, the inability of customers and colleagues to reach or have transportation to our stores and facilities, the evacuation of the population from areas in which our stores and facilities are located, the unavailability of our online platforms or our delivery and Click & Collect services, changes in customer purchasing patterns and in disposable income, disruptions to supply and logistics chain, reduced availability of products in our stores, disruptions to utilities for our stores and facilities, increased freight costs and wholesale energy prices, shortage of raw materials and disruptions to our communications network. Responding to such events and their effects may require a significant amount of management attention and resources, which may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our ongoing business operations. In particular, COVID-19 had a significant impact on our operations, including by, among other things, requiring us to manage customer numbers at our premises, reduce the operation of certain stores depending on the guidelines or orders of the relevant government, invest in protective and other safety equipment, accelerate the 49 ----- deployment of automated check-outs, increase our capacity for home delivery and Click & Collect purchase options, build up our inventory of consumer staples and undertake a transition to a remote work environment for our corporate offices in response to new regulatory requirements. Whilst many of these measures are no longer necessary, we have retained a few, such as automated check-out services for our customers and the ability for certain of our colleagues to adopt a hybrid work routine. A renewed COVID-19 outbreak or any other future pandemic, could result in disruptions to our supply chain, divert management’s attention, adversely affect the price of, availability of and demand for certain food products or limit the total number of customers that may be in the store at any one time. Any of the foregoing impacts of COVID-19 or any other future pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The scope and duration of any such impacts cannot be predicted because of the unprecedented nature of COVID-19 or similar events. We risk exposure to losses incurred as a result of damage to, or destruction of, our and our suppliers’ (including other third parties on which we rely) stores and facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and business and service interruption caused by such events. These events and their impact could otherwise disrupt and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See “—Risks Relating to Legal and _Regulatory Matters—We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to significant financial risks if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate.” Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurance_ that we would be able to successfully recover our costs, in full or in part, should we experience an event of the types described above or other business continuity problem.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.9,"We are vulnerable to cost inflation and fluctuations in the availability and price of food ingredients and products, commodities and packing material, as well as to fluctuations in the price of electricity and fuel and labour, transportation and manufacturing costs.","Our results of operations are influenced by market prices for certain essential food ingredients and products, commodities, packing materials, gas, electricity and fuel, as well as other raw materials and energy-related costs and labour, transportation and manufacturing costs. Increases in prices or scarcity of any of these ingredients, commodities, products or materials required for our business could materially increase our costs and disrupt our operations. Food cost inflation, particularly during periods of rapid inflation, could reduce our operating margins as it may reduce the demand for our products. In addition, there may be a lag between the occurrence of the price increase and the time at which we are able to increase the price of our products and pass them on to our customers. Volatility in the price and availability of raw materials can result from a wide variety of factors beyond our control, including poor harvests, shortages or interruptions, weather conditions, disease, political instability and changes in climate, among many other factors. Events such as Brexit, COVID-19 lockdowns, the war in Ukraine or the threat of political or social unrest (or the perceived threat thereof) have had or may have a material adverse impact on commodity, product or material prices, the availability of food ingredients and products, and labour, transportation and manufacturing costs. See “— _Our business is dependent on the economic situation in the United Kingdom and we are exposed to local, regional, national and global economic, political, social and other trends that could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_ Notwithstanding our hedging policies, we cannot fully eliminate the risks of price movements or risks associated with the availability of food products and ingredients. For example, we are currently experiencing industry-wide retail price inflation arising from labour shortages, the war in Ukraine, increases in the cost of key commodities, freight inflation, the shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers and increases in wholesale energy prices, which may cause our suppliers to raise their prices, which could materially increase our costs and negatively impact our business. Whilst it is not possible to predict the long-term impact of the war in Ukraine, it has resulted in significant volatility in the price of energy and price and availability of agricultural and other commodities in the short-term (such as wheat, for example), as well as volatility in the market price of commodities. Our ability to pass along increased costs through price increases to our customers depends upon competitive conditions in our industry and pricing regulations and may not be compatible with our business ethos and strategy. If we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers or if the higher cost of the products offered results in decreased demand for our products, our business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our brand, may be materially adversely affected. Food purchases account for a significant portion of our cost of goods sold. The prices of ingredients that we and our suppliers purchase are subject to volatility. Such fluctuations are attributable to, among other things, global commodity prices (which may be because of such commodity’s availability), currency exchange rates, and fiscal 50 ----- policy support for agriculture. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia in 2022, for example, led to significant rises in the price and availability of key ingredients, such as sunflower oil. The increase in inflation globally and the United Kingdom since 2022 has also increased our costs of acquiring ingredients, products, and the volatility of prices, and this inflation impact continues. See also “—Our business is dependent on the economic situation in the United _Kingdom and we are exposed to local, regional, national and global economic, political, social and other trends that could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.” Our operations are_ dependent on a number of key supplier relationships, including our relationship with our wholly-owned subsidiary, IPL. As a result, we may be impacted by inbound cost inflation earlier than our competitors. We may not be able to preserve our profit margin during periods of increased food inflation without suffering reduced revenue, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increases in prices or scarcity of ingredients or packaging materials required for our products could increase our costs and disrupt our operations. In addition, our ability to pass along increased costs through price increases to our customers depends upon competitive conditions in our industry and pricing regulations. If we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers or the higher cost of the products offered results in decreased demand for our products, our profitability, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, fuel prices have remained high with the potential to increase the operating costs of our sites, which require large quantities of energy to regulate store & warehouse temperatures, in particular cold chain storage facilities that ensure the integrity of our products prior to sale, as well as fuel required for our vehicle fleet, which we cannot guarantee will not increase in the future. Energy costs, impacted by reduced Russian supply due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, have reduced and stabilised but remain higher than at any time since June 2021, and the risk of supply disruption and price volatility has increased due to tensions in the Middle East and Red Sea shipping routes. Increases in energy costs, whether driven by increased demand, decreased or disrupted supply or an anticipation of any such events will increase the costs of operating our stores. In addition, while shipping costs had previously fallen, these have more than doubled since the end of 2023 due to maritime traffic in the Red Sea. This has increased import prices in the short term with longer shipping times causing a reduction of supplies of intermediate inputs and consumer goods and the outlook for shipping costs remains uncertain. Increases in energy costs, whether driven by increased demand, decreased or disrupted supply or an anticipation of any such events will increase the costs of operating our stores. Fluctuations in the price of fuel products may also negatively affect the business of our petrol stations. Any increase in the prices at which we purchase our fuel inventory or our costs in partnering with third parties could adversely affect the margins on the fuel and non-fuel products and services we sell at our forecourts, and we may not be able to raise our prices due to economic conditions, competition, regulation, contractual terms or other factors. Fuel prices have been high in recent years and have fluctuated as a result of various factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as global and regional supply and demand, geopolitical and economic uncertainty, including the Russia-Ukraine war which has threatened supply lines and resulted in embargoes of certain supply sources, and the most recent escalation of the conflict in the Middle East (including tensions in the Red Sea), as well as pricing and availability of competing alternative fuel technologies. In addition, our fuel margins have increased materially in the past few years, and there is a risk that the margins may revert back to previous levels in the future. Changing fuel prices and the inability to project future prices can from time to time impact our business. For example, changing fuel prices affect the market value of our fuel inventories and expose us to significant fluctuations in the recorded value of our inventory and the related costs of goods sold, thus reducing our profit margins. In particular, when fuel cost prices increase, whether as a result of governmental intervention or global oil market conditions, we may not always be able to pass such increases onto our customers, which may reduce our fuel margins. Fluctuations in fuel cost prices may be exacerbated in the future, for example, as a result of environmental legislation or regulation or we may face pressure from consumers and governments to not increase our fuel retail prices. As such, there can be no assurance that the price of fuel will remain stable or that we will be able to pass any price increases onto our consumers, in a timely manner or at all, resulting in higher expenses, lower margins and other material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

See “Business—Key Strengths” and “Business—Business Strategy.” Failure to properly deploy capital and other resources to further our strategy may negatively affect our planned initiatives. Any misjudgements, flaws or inadequacies in our execution could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The retail business continues to rapidly evolve, and consumers increasingly embrace online shopping, convenience and accessibility. As a result, the portion of total customer expenditures with retailers occurring through online platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. Accordingly, an important part of our business strategy involves offering a seamless omni-channel customer experience by integrating innovative online and mobile application-based solutions. Our ability to adapt our online offer and, in particular, to develop online sales depends on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully market our websites and social media, our ability to identify additional key partnerships for the expansion of our online channels, the capability of our existing distribution network to accommodate our growing online operations and the ability to successfully leverage our expanding online operations. However, we cannot assure you that our online operations will continue to grow. Expansion into the convenience and foodservice market is also a key part of our strategy. However, this expansion into convenience and foodservice may not be successful. It may require substantial additional capital expenditures, and we may not be able to compete with well-established competitors. In addition, integrating innovative omni-channel options into the retail store experience is critical for us to maintain our market position. Omni-channel retailing continues to evolve, our customers are increasingly more likely to shop across multiple channels that work in tandem, and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments. The portion of total consumer purchases occurring online and through mobile applications, as well as smaller store convenience formats, has continued to increase. The pace of this increase could further accelerate in the future. Our business has evolved from an in-store experience to interaction with customers across numerous channels, including in-store, online, mobile and social media, among others. We are making investments in our websites, mobile applications and new store formats. If we are unable to make, improve, or develop relevant customer-facing technology in a timely manner, or adapt our store estate or logistic network to keep up with the growth of our online and convenience sectors, our ability to compete and our results of operations could be adversely affected. Our strategy also relies on identifying, developing and/or adopting key technology solutions that allow us to integrate innovative online shopping processes into our operations. We may not be able to secure the requisite technology to implement our strategy, either due to cost or intellectual property rights of third parties. We may also fail to integrate new digital tools into our systems which could reduce their effectiveness. Our strategy, which includes investments in online channels, technology, store remodels and other customer-focused initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our business, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact of the growth of our business. The success of our strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience for our customers. Failure to successfully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position and financial performance. In addition, increased online sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and materially adversely affect our financial performance. Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot guarantee the successful execution of our business strategy. Additionally, the implementation of our strategy may put operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the detriment of our existing business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the results initially expected, we may be unable to recover our investment, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the cost of certain online and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred, could adversely impact our financial performance in the short-term and failure to realise the benefits of these investments may adversely impact our financial performance over the longer term. 52 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The George Clothing and George Home brands compete on the basis of, among other things, the location of our stores; website, mobile applications and their respective design; the breadth, quality, style price and availability of our merchandise; and the level of customer service offered. In particular, the George Clothing brand faces competition from other low-cost and fast fashion retailers that have recently made significant price investments in their merchandise offerings and target some of the same categories of customers as the George Clothing brand. We expect competition to increase in the future. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our apparel, footwear and homeware retail sectors and our existing competitors are constantly adjusting their pricing, business strategies and promotional activity (particularly during holiday periods) in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition. Additionally, the substantial sales growth in online apparel, footwear and homeware retail within the last decade has encouraged the entry of many new competitors, new business models and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online shopping alternatives. The internet and other technologies also facilitate comparison shopping in our apparel, footwear and homeware retail segments. Our digital channel competes against numerous websites, mobile applications and catalogues, which may have a greater volume of circulation and web traffic or more effective marketing through online media and social networking sites. We offer an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and use social media and mobile applications as a way to interact with them to enhance their shopping experiences. Omni-channel retailing is constantly evolving, and we must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. There is no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully maintain or expand our digital sales channels and respond to shifting consumer traffic patterns and digital buying trends. Our inability to adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties or successfully maintain and expand our digital business could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We may not be able to continue to compete successfully against existing or future competitors.

Significant disruptions in our production and/or distribution, particularly for perishable goods, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.","We are subject to risks associated with delivery of products to our customers through our hub and spoke logistics model and our delivery fleet, which operates predominantly by road, but also indirectly through third parties’ deliveries by deep-sea freight and air. We operate with tailored logistics structures concentrated in a relatively small number of distribution facilities to supply and deliver our products. There is a risk that any of these facilities may be materially adversely affected by extraordinary events, such as a fire or an explosion. In some such cases, insurance is subject to limitations and therefore may not cover all of our losses. See “Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory _Matters—We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to significant financial risks if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate.” Any increases in the cost of transportation, including as a_ result of increased fuel prices or environmental regulations or initiatives that mandate more costly methods of transport, could significantly increase our cost of doing business. The efficiency and functioning of our supply chain without disruptions or delays is essential, especially for our fresh food products. Changes in our logistics structures, including as a result of impacts to our facilities, labour disruptions, fleet problems, natural events, technical disruptions, malfeasance or accidents, could lead to a temporary or extended disruption of our operations, disrupt product availability and inventory management and have a negative impact on our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, increases in freight costs through increased fuel prices and surcharges and increases in oil prices, delays in manufacturing and transportation due to congestions at ports of loading and ports of entry (such as freight disruptions arising from port-of-entry limitations or restrictions in the United Kingdom during late 2021 and 2022, resulting from 53 ----- supply chain disruptions triggered by COVID-19 and compounded by port congestion and border control restrictions attributed to Brexit and most recently), as a result of the escalation of the conflict in the Middle East (including tensions in the Red Sea, and their impact on global shipping routes), quality control issues, a supplier’s financial distress, natural disasters or health crises, regulatory actions or ethical sourcing issues, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have had or may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, disruption as a result of major incidents or external events can have a number of impacts, for example increased freight costs and wholesale energy prices and shortage of raw materials. Any disruption to our supply chain or suppliers can impact our future. There is no assurance that such pressures will not increase in the future which could materially increase our costs and impact our business. Sourcing and supply chain challenges could also be exacerbated through climate change as adverse weather conditions increasingly disrupt our ability to source, transport and deliver goods whilst also impacting our customers’ ability to access our stores. Furthermore, the growth of our business is subject to limitations on the capacity of our current supply chain network and our ability to expand that network to meet our changing needs. Our failure to grow our supply chain network in line with the growth of our business could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, should we lose our supply chain finance providers, our ability to pay our suppliers on time may be impaired and our relationships with suppliers might suffer as a result, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

See “Business—Our Suppliers and Logistics.” In addition to IPL, we are also dependent on certain third-party suppliers for our products, which exposes us to risks that such suppliers may fail to meet timelines, provide us with sufficient inventory or comply with our specifications. If a delay or interruption of delivery were to occur either temporarily or permanently for any reason, we may not be able to meet customer demand, which may result in fewer sales and may harm our brand. For example, there is an increased risk within the import business due to tensions in the Red Sea, and their impact on global shipping routes. In addition, the recent constraints on global freight and cargo capacity as well as the ongoing shortages of qualified HGV drivers may in turn reduce, and in certain instances has reduced, the traditional range of products available to our customers. Further, as we require our suppliers to meet certain specifications and standards to ensure the quality of our products, the use of third-party suppliers increases the demands on our quality control personnel. If the products provided by our suppliers do not meet the relevant quality standards, our reputation may be materially adversely affected. In addition, we depend on certain of our suppliers for certain of our successful popular own-brand products which contribute to store traffic and sales. Any disruption of delivery of these key high-volume products may have a material adverse effect on our sales. Further, the associated reputational risks are heightened in the context of suppliers who supply and/or manufacture our own-brand products. See also “—Any events that negatively impact the reputation of, or value associated with, _our brands could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.”_ There can be no guarantee that we will not be required to make changes to our supplier base, and at any point may be required to contract with other suppliers on less favourable terms and/or at a greater cost. While we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, and alternate suppliers are generally available, we do not have long-term contracts with all of our suppliers. As a result, certain of our suppliers could increase their prices or fail to deliver sufficient quantities to us in a timely fashion or at all. There is also a risk that suppliers will consolidate, giving us fewer choices and creating pricing pressure. Any deterioration in our relationships with our suppliers, the imposition of stricter conditions by suppliers (especially with respect to stringent payment terms or as a result of the willingness of credit insurers to reduce the exposure of our suppliers) or the non-renewal of our key supply agreements may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we experience a need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that additional suppliers will be available when required on terms acceptable to us. In addition, even if we were able to find new suppliers on acceptable terms, we may encounter 54 ----- delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it would take to train such suppliers in our methods, products, quality control standards, employment, health and safety standards. Our operations are dependent on a number of key supplier relationships, including IPL. While IPL is wholly-owned by Asda, any interruption to IPL’s operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are dependent on suppliers of the machinery used within our hub and spoke facilities for their continued supply and maintenance. We are also dependent on other third parties, including landlords and distributors, and other suppliers. If any such suppliers ceased operations or was temporarily unable to supply its respective services, this could materially adversely affect our operations or financial condition until an alternative supplier is found, and there could be no guarantee that any alternative supplier would be as satisfactory as the existing arrangements. Any adverse changes to our relationships with these suppliers and third parties or in a reduction in availability or level of service offered by these suppliers and third-party providers could restrict our ability to conduct our business and thereby adversely impact our financial condition and prospects. Our relationship with suppliers based in foreign markets presents certain risks. For example, if such suppliers are non-compliant with labour laws on manufacturing and the values listed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, we could be subject to action from international trade unions with whom we have no day-to-day relationship. There is also a risk that our suppliers may not comply with relevant anti-corruption laws, health and safety laws, environmental laws or other laws and regulations, which could result in reputational damage to Asda’s brand, loss of consumer trust or human rights or anti-corruption law investigations of Asda. In addition to non-compliance with international or domestic labour, health and safety laws or environmental laws, we face a variety of risks generally associated with sourcing products from suppliers in foreign markets, including, among others, political instability; increased security requirements applicable to foreign goods; the imposition of taxes, duties, other charges and restrictions on imports; currency and exchange rate risks; risks related to environmental matters or other issues in the foreign countries or factories in which our products are manufactured; delays in shipping; and increased costs of transportation.

We depend on the use of refrigerated trailers for the shipping of certain of our products from our suppliers’ facilities to our distribution centres, from our distribution centres to our stores and from our stores and distribution centres to our customers. Asda drivers deliver goods to stores and customers using a fleet of leased tractors, trailers and vans, as well as occasional spot-hire or third-party hauliers. See “Business—Our Suppliers and Logistics.” Transportation costs have historically fluctuated significantly over time, in particular in connection with oil prices, and increases in transportation costs could result in reduced profits. For example, more recently we have experienced increases in global shipping rates resulting from increased demand for container-based shipping and increases in the cost of fuel for our HGV fleet resulting from increases in the global price of oil, which, especially if protracted, could materially increase our costs and adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, climate change related taxes and levies are a large portion of the energy related costs required to maintain the cold chain. These climate change related taxes have been increasing in recent years and are expected to increase in the future. We are subject to regulations governing the number of hours and days that drivers can work consecutively, and as a result, we may not have enough drivers available to work during periods of very high demand or adverse weather conditions. Additionally, we face competition from other retailers and businesses in hiring and retaining drivers and couriers for our delivery services and distribution network. Moreover, delivery service is also a field with inherent high attrition rate and job mobility. We have been facing sustained freight inflation, plus a shortage of heavy goods vehicle drivers across the United Kingdom. In addition, the reduction in the number of EU nationals working in the United Kingdom following Brexit has led to shortages of staff at national food suppliers and in the food supply chain, as well as a shortage of drivers in the logistics sector. As a result, we may not be able to hire a sufficient number of drivers to meet our demand, which may result in us paying increased labour costs in order to attract new drivers or retain existing ones. Continued labour shortages or increased labour costs could materially adversely impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, climate change related taxes and levies are a large portion of the energy related costs required to maintain the cold chain. These climate change related taxes have been increasing in recent years and are expected to increase in the future. Any increases in the cost of labour or 55 ----- transportation, including as a result of increased fuel prices or environmental regulations or initiatives that mandate more costly methods of transport, could significantly increase our cost of doing business. An impairment or loss of one or more distribution centres due to accidents, fires, technical disruptions, sabotage or other events, or an impairment or disruption in IPL’s or other suppliers’ service, including significant price increases, could result in a temporary disruption in the delivery of products to our stores and additional costs. Although we believe that we would be able to find an alternative distribution centre or an alternative operator, if necessary, we may be unable to find alternative providers in a timely fashion, on reasonable terms, or at all. We also require last-mile transport for our delivery services, which is one of the most expensive parts of the transportation process. Changes in these agreements governing the relationships with these providers could also result in reduced profits. Any increases in the cost of transportation, and any disruption to our transportation and logistics systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

For example, we have in the past and may in the future, enter into transactions with EG Group, which is also owned by our shareholders. Following the EG UK Acquisition, many of our transactions with the EG Group business that had been considered “affiliate transactions” ceased to be affiliate transactions by virtue of the fact that we now own the EG UK Business and such business forms part of the Group. However, there can be no assurance that we will not enter into future transaction with EG Group or other related parties. We disclose all material related party transactions in our financial statements and have implemented certain policies and procedures whereby certain employees and committees screen each of the material transactions for any possible affiliations between us and companies controlled by us or our shareholders. See note 30 (“Related parties”) to the 2023 Financial Statements appearing herein for further disclosure on our related party transactions. See also “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.” In addition, we maintain robust internal governance procedures whereby we screen every agreement we enter into to determine if it is an affiliate transaction by cross-checking the party to our list of affiliates. In the event a counterparty is an affiliate, we work closely with our controllership and corporate governance teams to ensure that transactions are conducted at arm’s length. Although our corporate governance guidelines require that we engage in any related party transactions on an arm’s length basis, there can be no assurance that the terms of any such transactions will be as favourable to us as would be the case had they not been with related parties. The appearance of conflicts, even if such conflicts do not materialise, might adversely affect the public’s perception of us, as well as our relationship with other companies and our ability to enter into new relationships in the future, including with competitors of such related parties, which could harm our business and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

One of our objectives is to use digital tools to enhance the in-store experience from product selection to checkout and further develop the omni-channel retail experience we offer our customers. We rely in part on third parties for development of and access to such new technologies and tools. We expect that new services and technologies will continue to emerge. These new services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies that we currently use. Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies and adapt to new technological changes and evolving industry standards.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

These cyber-attacks or data breaches materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.","Our online channels are currently supported by a number of legacy technology platforms, all of which will be replaced in 2024 with new systems as part of Project Future. Further, we have successfully converted seven depots as 56 ----- of March 31, 2024 as part of our new Warehouse Management system “Manhattan” (with two more in progress) and have implemented our new store till systems across many stores. These online channels, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorised access to our websites and mobile applications to obtain and misuse customers’ information, including payment information. Such attacks, if successful, in addition to potential data misuse, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage one or more of our online platforms, which may significantly disrupt our customers’ shopping experience. If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable parameters, we could suffer sanction, loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our strategy or the growth of our business. Any of these risks could be amplified if we are unable to smoothly transition onto our new IT system as part of Project Future. The UK online grocery industry is still developing and rapidly evolving. Our online grocery operations must, therefore, be considered in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter operating in an industry that is still evolving. These risks and difficulties include: - managing rapid growth in personnel and operations; - developing sufficient management and technology capability in a rapidly evolving industry; - managing and further developing a complex business system; - capital expenditures associated with the development of our online operations and support functions; - risks surrounding online payments; - further development to our infrastructure and technology solutions; - maintaining our profit margins if consumer preferences shift overall to prefer online sales over brickand-mortar store sales; and - accurately predicting future capacity requirements and ability to maintain or grow market share. Furthermore, we may be affected by an increase in governmental regulation of the internet and/or online retail. The application or modification of existing laws or regulations, or adoption of new laws and regulations governing the internet and online retail operations could materially adversely affect the manner in which we currently conduct our online business. The legislative framework governing the internet remains largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. In addition, the growth and development of the market for online retail may lead to more stringent customer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on us, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects. We may be subject to privacy or data protection failures, including in respect of the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of EUWA (the “UK GDPR”). We collect, process and utilise personal data from customers, business contacts, colleagues and other third-parties, marketing initiatives and the large number of credit and debit transactions we process, and the failure to adequately maintain and protect such information, or failure to comply with applicable data protection laws, including by providing adequate privacy notices to our online users, ensuring lawful use of the data, fulfilling rights requests and maintaining consents, could increase the risk of data loss or misuse or other data breaches and could have a material adverse effect on our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See also “—We collect and process _personal data in our daily business, and the leakage of such data may violate law and could materially adversely affect our business.”_ We rely on third-party service providers to process customer payments made using debit cards and credit cards. Our online operations depend heavily upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. The use and handling of this personal information is regulated by 57 ----- evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations at the sub-national, national and international level, as well as by certain third-party contracts. The legal and regulatory frameworks governing the use and handling of personal information are relatively new and are still evolving. If we or any of our third-party service providers fail to store, transmit and purge customer information in a secure or otherwise compliant manner, if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, a cyberattack or a network security incident, or if our colleagues or certain third-parties fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations (and, as a result, information about our customers or colleagues is obtained by unauthorised persons and/or used inappropriately), we could be subject to liabilities and penalties, damage to our reputation, litigation or government enforcement actions, substantial costs and a loss of customer confidence, all of which may significantly adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

These systems are interdependent and disruptions in the IT infrastructure that we use could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.","We rely on an extensive array of information systems (including servers, networks, applications, websites and databases) that are essential to the operation and management of our activities. The development, implementation and continuous and uninterrupted performance of our hardware, network, applications, website and other systems, including those which may be provided by third parties, are important factors in our delivery of products and services to our customers. We are dependent on our technical infrastructure and computer applications for all aspects of the day-to-day management of our business, including purchasing, sourcing, distribution, online sales, customer delivery, data exploitation, invoicing, cash collection, reporting and consolidation, as well as electronic data exchange and access to internal information, all of which provide necessary information upon which management makes its business decisions. Our performance depends on accurate, timely information and numerical data from key software applications to aid day-to-day business and decision-making processes. We are exposed to operational risks, such as the breakdown or failure of equipment, interruption of power supplies or processes, fires, floods or other natural disasters, acts of sabotage or vandalism, and industrial accidents. We rely on our information technology systems for communication among our suppliers, stores, distribution centres and headquarters and for our online sales. We may be adversely affected if our controls fail to detect or contain operational risks. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain the related automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to adverse effects, including billing and collection errors, business disruptions and damages related to security breaches. Any disruption caused by failings in our information technology infrastructure or underlying equipment or of communication networks could delay or otherwise impact our day-to-day business and decision-making processes and negatively impact our performance. Failure of our IT infrastructure or key IT systems could lead to loss of earnings, regulatory fines, limit our ability to operate effectively and have a negative impact on our reputation. We currently rely on Walmart for a material portion of our technology services and will continue to depend on Walmart to maintain and develop IT systems for our use during the term of the TSA. If we are unable to transition from the Walmart IT system onto a suitable replacement system, it could result in a material disruption to our business. See also “Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions—Delays in our ability to separate from Walmart could result in _significant cost and any issues with the separation process, particularly related to our transition to a new IT system, could significantly disrupt business operations and impact our ability to meet our strategic objectives” and “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart.” We are undergoing a_ separation programme, Project Future, to transition the Group to a standalone, leading edge IT infrastructure which will enable it to improve operating efficiencies, make better use of data, improve its experience for customers and colleagues, and enable the business to be more agile in responding to customers’ needs. There is a high degree of complexity in connection with the implementation of the IR system and we may not be able to successfully transition these systems to our standalone operations in a timely manner, or at all, or may have underestimated the costs required to do so. There can be no assurance that there will not be errors, delays, payroll transition issues, or other related issues resulting from the transition to a standalone company and adjustments to associated business processes or that we will be able to fix any error or issue. We also depend on other third parties to maintain and develop our IT systems. If such providers were to terminate their agreements with us or stop providing services to us for any reason, or if such providers were to 58 ----- considerably raise the price of their services, our business would be materially and adversely affected. Some of these providers are small companies and their long-term financial viability cannot be assured. We cannot guarantee you that we will be able to find and retain alternative providers or acquire the rights to intellectual property important to our operations if our current or future providers become financially unstable. To the extent any of these systems, technologies or programmes do not function properly and we cannot find and retain a suitable IT provider to help remedy the fault, we may experience material adverse effects on our business that require substantial additional investments to remedy, or which we may not be able to remedy at all. The performance of the IT systems that we use depends on, among other things, our ability to effectively safeguard such IT systems and related equipment against damage or compromise from interruptions to telecommunication services, data breaches, hacking and phishing attempts and the introduction of malware and computer viruses. Delays or interruptions in the delivery of our products could result from unknown data, software or hardware defects, insufficient capacity or the failure of our website hosting, mobile applications and telecommunications vendors to provide continuous and uninterrupted service. Any significant breakdown of plant or equipment, accidents, such as a serious flood, fire and other natural disasters, or other significant disruption to the operations of our primary sites for all of our computer and communications systems could significantly affect our ability to manage our information technology systems. Our equipment and technology systems also require ongoing maintenance, refinement, updating and may also require replacement with more advanced equipment or systems in the future. If we are unable to maintain more advanced equipment or systems in the future or upgrade our IT system regularly, we may experience difficulties with the adoption of new technology and systems into our existing operations. Furthermore, disruptions to operations or interruptions in operations involving such systems may occur in the future. Any material disruption or slowdown of our equipment or technology systems, including those caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our equipment or systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure protection against unauthorised attempts to access the IT systems that we use, including malicious third-party applications that may interfere with or exploit security flaws in our products and services. We rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security necessary to effect the secure transmission of information from our customers, such as credit or debit card numbers (although as part of our Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (“PCI-DSS”) compliance we do not store this data but use third-party payment providers). At the same time, we increasingly rely on cloud computing and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of Asda and customer information on our behalf. We cannot guarantee absolute protection against unauthorised attempts to access our or these third parties’ IT systems, including third party applications that may interfere with or exploit security flaws in our or these third parties’ products and services. Viruses, worms and other malicious software programmes could, among other things, jeopardise the security of information stored in a user’s computer or in our or these third parties’ computer systems, affect the availability of our or these third parties’ computer systems or attempt to change the internet experience of users by interfering with our ability to connect with users. In addition, in the past, we have also experienced system intrusion attempts through non-cyber means, including through fraudulent phone calls. We have seen an increase over the past several years in the frequency and sophistication of attempts to compromise the security of the types of IT and other systems we use. If any compromise in our security measures, or those of the third parties we rely on (including our suppliers) were to occur and our, or their, efforts to combat such a breach are unsuccessful, our reputation may be harmed leading to a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects. Any failure of such IT systems due to a technical issue or a cyberattack, and any failure of our IT systems’ support teams to mitigate such IT system failures, could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and assets. For example, any such failure could impact on the availability of electronic point of sale (EPOS) systems and therefore limit our ability to complete sales. Moreover, a failure that causes our websites to become unavailable could materially adversely affect online product viewing opportunities and sales. If any compromise in our security measures were to occur and our efforts to combat such a breach were unsuccessful, our operations would be interrupted and our reputation could be harmed, leading to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 59 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Open-source software is typically licensed for use at no initial charge on terms which allow modification and distribution of the software by the licensee. However, licence terms may impose on the user compliance requirements and obligations to disclose modifications we have made to the software to third parties. Our ability to realise fully the commercial benefits of any such software may be restricted because: - Open-source licences may be drafted in legally ambiguous language and may result in unanticipated consequences or obligations regarding our software; - due to the requirements to licence modified software, our competitors or licensees may have access to information which may help them to develop competitive products; - open-source software is available to the public for anyone to access and utilise, including our competitors; and - it may be difficult for us to identify accurately the developers of the open-source code (who may be licensors of the software) and whether the licensed software infringes third party intellectual property rights. Furthermore, to the extent we use open-source software we face certain more general risks which apply to any organisation making use of such software. Our use of GNU General Public Licence (“GPL”) software could subject certain portions of our proprietary software to GPL requirements, including an obligation on us to disclose that software to third parties and to permit them to use the software free of charge. Finally, open-source licences typically present onerous compliance requirements and failure to observe these may result in litigation or the loss of the right to use the software which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and future prospects. Although we are not aware that we have breached any of these compliance requirements, and to our knowledge no third party has claimed that software owned by us should be made available on an open-source basis, any of the risks or restrictions relating to open-source software mentioned above could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and future prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

We use our websites, social media, online advertising, and email campaigns to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel strategy, we offer home delivery and pickup options under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up in-store by the customer via our Click & Collect offer and our Scan&Go service that allows customers to use a handset or the Scan&Go mobile app to scan and bag items as they shop and utilise a dedicated checkout area for quick and easy payment, in each case providing additional customer traffic at such stores. In 2022, we also implemented a new loyalty programme, Asda Rewards, which is an app-based system whereby customers earn cash back on their shopping, building Asda Pounds in their cash pots to spend in store and online, and earn additional discounts on certain products. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving part of the UK retail grocery industry. We must anticipate and meet our customers’ changing expectations while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors’ operations through focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels.

Consumers value readily available information concerning retailers, manufacturers and their goods and services and often act on such information without further investigation, authentication and without regard to its accuracy. The availability of information on social media platforms and devices is virtually immediate as is its impact. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is virtually limitless. Information concerning or affecting us may be posted on such platforms and devices at any time. Information posted may be inaccurate and adverse to us, and it may harm our business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Such platforms also could be used for the dissemination of trade secret information or compromise of other valuable company assets, any of which could harm our business. We also use social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain TikTok, Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts. In addition, we may from time-to-time partner with celebrities, influencers and other third parties across various social media platforms, but there can be no assurance that these campaigns will be successful or that their values align with Asda’s values and therefore our association with such parties may negatively affect or harm our reputation. Furthermore, other social media users with whom we do not have partnerships or control over may use their accounts and following based on these social media platforms to criticise Asda with subjective or false, or without basis, which may in turn adversely impact our reputation.

Such leases usually provide for regular rent reviews, at which time our rental costs may increase in line with certain indices or in line with the open market rent. Our ability to maintain our existing rental rates during 61 ----- renewals or to renew any expired lease on favourable terms will depend on many factors which are not within our control, such as applicable real estate laws and regulations, payments for utilities, local taxes or assessments, conditions in the local real estate market, competition for desirable properties and our relationships with current and prospective landlords. If rent reviews were to increase at higher rates than currently anticipated or if we were unable to renew any expired leases on commercially favourable terms, our financial performance could be adversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to extend expiring lease agreements at all or may have no or limited ability to close certain store locations that do not meet our financial targets or are no longer consistent with our brands’ positioning. These changes in the size of our store network can have a significant impact on our revenues and expenses from one period to the next, which affect the comparability of our results during these periods. Our ability to enter into leases to open new retail locations depends on the availability of locations that meet our criteria for traffic, square footage, lease economics, demographics and other factors. In addition, the market for suitable retail locations is highly competitive. Some of our competitors may have the ability to negotiate more favourable commercial lease terms than we can. The above risks are also applicable to (i) the leases of the Warehouse Assets pursuant to the 2021 Sale and Leaseback Transactions, (ii) the leases of the SLB Properties pursuant to the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and (iii) the leases of the CGR Properties pursuant to the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction.

Forfeiture of the leases would result in the loss of our right to occupy the property and may entail material interruption to the business and operations of the Group. In addition, a breach of any Ground Lease may entitle the lender under the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction to accelerate the Ground Rent Transaction Facility Agreement and enforce security over all properties secured under the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction resulting in the loss of ownership of the freehold and long leases properties comprising the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction.

In a depressed market or if there is no demand for a property, the Group may not be able to exit that property in a cost-efficient manner, or at all. In terms of the Ground Leases, the tenant is not permitted to assign so in order to exit the property the tenant may seek to underlet the property (subject to the restrictions contained in the Ground Leases); the implication of this is that on such an underletting the tenant remains liable for any non-performance of the tenant covenants in the relevant lease by the undertenant.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

From time to time, we may experience labour disputes and we can never rule out the possibility of work stoppages. We are also exposed to similar risks involving the workforce of our third-party suppliers, including all of our distribution centre operators. In particular, a labour stoppage or other interruption at one of our suppliers or distribution centres would impact our ability to supply our stores or online orders and could have a pronounced effect on our operations as a result. As we do not directly control our suppliers, we have limited information on labour relations between our suppliers and their workforces. 62 ----- In addition, some of our colleagues are members of trade unions and are parties to collective bargaining agreements, which contain provisions covering issues such as working hours and compensation. See “Business—Our _Colleagues.” We may not be able to extend existing agreements, renew them on their current terms or, negotiate such_ agreements in a favourable and timely manner or without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business.

It may in the future become more difficult for us to recruit or retain such members of staff with the relevant skillset, retain key colleagues, or adapt colleague skillsets to align with transformation activities, which could lead to a negative impact on operational performance, a delay in separation transformation and ultimately impact our external reputation. Moreover, the UK labour market may become more competitive. An inability to recruit and retain sufficient personnel of the right calibre or the incurring of significant costs in order to do so may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and future prospects. Furthermore, our automated warehouses and delivery trucks still require intensive labour. Colleague benefits (which include wages, National Insurance contributions and other payments) currently represent one of our most significant cost items, accounting for a substantial portion of our total expenses. Consequently, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to manage our labour costs and control their impact on our margins. We may in the future be forced to raise our wages due to changes in market conditions, new labour laws and regulations, collective bargaining with our recognised trade unions or general wage increases across the industry or in any particular region in which we operate. For example, in April 2023, we voluntarily increased our rate for hourly-paid store colleagues to £11.00 an hour and further increased this in July 2023 to £11.11 an hour. For stores inside the M25 and around Greater London, our rate for hourly-paid store colleagues increased to £12.28 an hour. The national minimum wage is due to increase to £11.44 an hour in April 2024, and we plan to give our colleagues an interim increase, with those inside the M25 and around Greater London receiving £12.61 an hour. In July 2024, we are proposing a further increase in pay to 120,000 of our colleagues which will increase the basic pay for retail workers to £12.04 an hour, with those at stores inside the M25 and around Greater London receiving £13.21 an hour. Overall, this is an 8.4% increase in pay from £11.11 in July 2023 to the proposed £12.04 in July 2024. Additionally, we compete with other producers for dependable employees. The supply of such employees is limited and competition to hire and retain them may result in higher labour costs, for example as a result of higher wages implemented in response to inflationary pressure and cost of living increases. Furthermore, a number of our 63 ----- employees are subject to national minimum wage requirements. Given the high proportion of our colleagues who are paid hourly, future increases or changes to the National Minimum Wage legislation, the National Living Wage or other hourly wage legislation or regulations could have an impact on our future financial success. As of April 2023, the National Living Wage increased from £9.50 per hour as of April 2022 to £10.42 per hour. The National Living Wage will increase in increments with a target to be set by the UK government of reaching £11.44 by April 2024. We must comply with such legislation. Any failure to comply could result in criminal prosecution with any party found to be guilty of deliberate non-compliance being subject to disqualification as a company director for up to 15 years. From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings in connection with the wages we pay. See “Business—Legal _Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation.” If legislation is enacted that has the effect of raising national minimum wage_ requirements, requires additional mandatory employee benefits or affects our ability to hire or dismiss employees, we could face substantially higher labour costs. Increases in labour costs could adversely affect our profitability if we are not able to pass them on to our customers. As national minimum hourly wage rates increase, we may be required to increase not only the wage rates of our hourly paid colleagues but also the wages of our salaried managers as an increase in hourly rates inevitably erodes the pay gap between hourly paid and first line managers. This makes it more challenging to incentivise our most talented colleagues to progress into management positions. It also makes it difficult to retain our talented managers. Although difficult to predict with certainty, these higher salaried costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. While we cannot be certain how this will affect our business, an increase in the minimum wage rate paid to certain workers will increase our labour costs which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to meet our management labour needs, while controlling wage and labour-related costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of and competition for qualified persons in the local markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing pay rates, changing demographics, and changes in employment and labour laws. Such laws related to hours, wages, job classification and benefits could significantly increase operating costs. If we fail to maintain our competitive position on pay and benefits, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing our customer service to suffer, while increasing wages for our colleagues could cause our profit margins to decrease. If we are unable to hire, retain, and train colleagues capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, we are required to pay social security, National Insurance contributions, pension contributions and other similar charges for our colleagues. These may increase over time or the laws and regulations setting forth any exonerations or other exemptions from payment of such charges from which we currently benefit may change, increasing our liabilities. We maintain a defined contribution pension plan that covers current and former colleagues pursuant to which the employer, employee or both make contributions on a regular basis to such plans. See “Management’s Discussion _and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations— Asda Group Pension Scheme Buy-In.” Any of the foregoing may affect our profitability and may have a material_ adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to pass on such higher costs to our customers, these higher labour costs could materially adversely affect our profitability.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Intellectual property claims by third parties or our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive position.,"We own or use a variety of trade names, logos, domain names, service marks and trademarks in our business and rely on trademark and copyright laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual proprietary rights. We may not have adequate protections for our intellectual property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. We cannot be certain that third parties will not infringe, misappropriate or terminate these rights. With the exception of the George brand, we own nearly all the intellectual property rights over the trademarks, trade signs and copyrights that we use. We also own some of the intellectual property rights over the software and technologies that we use. However, such use may be challenged by 64 ----- third parties. If we are unable to protect and maintain our own intellectual property rights or our use of the intellectual property rights owned by others, or we are unable to renew our intellectual property rights when they expire, the value of our brands could be diminished, and our competitive position could weaken. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorised use of our proprietary rights. Third parties that licence our proprietary rights may also take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. In addition, our products, services, websites or acts conducted in the ordinary course of our business may violate, or be perceived to violate, intellectual property rights of third parties (in particular, copyrights, trademarks, design rights, patents and software) and we may be subject to infringement claims. We may also be involved in claims raised by third parties against our suppliers. For example, we may be involved in claims regarding products or services supplied by our suppliers that are perceived as infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. Third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us as we expand our business to include new services and continue to develop our online channel. We may also face claims from our suppliers if they consider that their intellectual property rights are being misused, especially where those suppliers have a strong brand image and reputation. Our defence of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be expensive and time consuming, and could divert management resources. Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability and prevent us from selling some of our products and/or services. In addition, the resolution of claims may require us to abandon the sale or provision of the litigious product or service, redesign our own private-label products or acquire licence rights from third parties, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

We have witnessed the rate of such crimes increase (in volume and frequency) recently, which may be linked to the continuing cost of living crisis in the United Kingdom. We and are our personnel are exposed to safety threats such as theft, assault or destruction of property. Higher crime rates throughout the United Kingdom could negatively our sales and operations. Despite our efforts to reduce our exposure to such crimes, for instance through security guards or security cameras on our sites, we expect to continue to be exposed to such crimes and new forms of crime. There can be no assurance that our current or future efforts to counteract crimes will be effective or that the cost of such efforts will not increase. In addition, we have been the target of other forms of crime such as, fraud and embezzlement by our colleagues. Any crime we become victim of may give rise to litigation and related costs, including reputational costs and the costs linked to the diversion of the attention from our management team from day-to-day operations of our business. A single significant incident of fraud, or increases in the overall level of fraud, may be sufficient to result in significant reputational damage to us or could lead to the imposition of regulatory sanctions. Our inability to control and reduce robberies, whether intentional or not, burglaries, fraud, embezzlement or other forms of crime in a cost-effective manner could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

For example, sales volumes have historically been higher in the run-up to the Christmas and Easter holidays and historically lower in February. In addition, sales of certain of our products have historically been higher during the summer tourist season. These seasonal influences have a direct impact on our earnings, and fluctuations in our inventory or store closings during these peak periods could affect our working capital requirements. If seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of other factors, including the timing of new store openings, temporary or definitive closings 65 ----- or disposals, and the revenue contributed by new stores or the loss of revenue from closed or sold stores. For these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons may not be a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future.

We accept payments using credit and debit cards, gift cards, contactless, PayPal, Android Pay and Apple Pay. As we offer new payment options to customers, we and our customers may be increasingly exposed to fraud (although fraud is not currently a significant concern). For existing and future payment options we offer our customers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments products). We pay interchange and other fees for these card payments, which may increase over time and raise operating costs and lower margins. Interchange fees on Visa and MasterCard are regulated and are therefore currently subject to an effective minimum amount, which is beyond our control. Interchange fees on American Express payments are negotiated with American Express on an arm’s-length basis. We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, and it could disrupt our operations if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, certification requirements, PCI-DSS and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted, making them difficult or impossible to comply with. If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and/or higher transaction fees and, in extreme cases, may lose our ability to accept payments from customers, process electronic funds transfers or facilitate other types of online payments. See also “—We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarise results and manage our _business. These systems are interdependent and disruptions in the IT infrastructure that we use could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”_ Any failure of our payment processing systems, whether caused by a systems failure or otherwise, will adversely affect our income in the short-term and may result in us losing customers which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects. In addition, there can be no assurance that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the processes we use to protect customer transaction data. If any such compromise or breach were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. In certain circumstances, our contract with our payment card acquirer and American Express generally require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process is compromised.

Our business could also be negatively impacted by merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by supranational and national laws and regulations.","We have in the past acquired and may in the future from time to time acquire other companies or businesses. Pursuing future acquisitions depends on, among other things, identifying suitable acquisition or investment opportunities and successfully completing those transactions. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company; difficulties in supporting and transitioning vendors, if any, of an acquired company; diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities; failure to realise the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction; failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or colleague or customer issues; risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience; potential loss of key colleagues, customers 66 ----- and suppliers from either our current business or an acquired company’s business; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs; additional costs associated with funding the acquisition; and possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses. Furthermore, acquisitions of businesses outside of our markets may present additional challenges due to cultural and linguistic differences and the difficulties presented by integrating and managing a business that is geographically more remote. Our ability to integrate and manage acquired businesses effectively and to handle any future growth will depend upon a number of factors, and failure to manage growth effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also “— _Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions—We may not be able to successfully integrate the businesses we have recently acquired into our business.”_ In addition, the growth of our business to date, and our future growth, has placed and is expected to continue to place significant demands on our management and operational and financial infrastructure. Managing growth has in the past and will in the future continue to require significant expenditure and allocation of management resources, as well as an expansion in headcount. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency as we continue to grow, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also “—We _depend on the services of our senior management team, and our business and growth strategy could be materially adversely impacted if we were to lose a significant number of members of our senior management and were unable to replace them with executives of equal experience and capabilities.”_ Acquisitions may also increase our indebtedness, both through debt incurred to finance the acquisition and existing indebtedness of the acquired company, which could make it more difficult to incur additional indebtedness. Any increase in indebtedness in connection with an acquisition may have a material adverse effect on us. See “— _Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure and the Senior Secured Notes—We may incur additional debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Senior Secured Notes, and impact our ability to operate our businesses.”_ Moreover, merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by national laws and regulations could negatively impact our business if such laws and regulations prevent us from expanding our growth through the consummation of mergers or acquisitions in certain categories or oblige us to divest certain stores or activities that may have an impact on our market shares in some geographical areas. For example, in order to address competitive concerns raised by the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”), we agreed to divest 13 sites in connection with the Arthur Acquisition. At the same time, if smaller players in our markets are able to consolidate, this could increase the competitive pressure on our business due to an increase in such competitors’ economies of scale and a reduction in their operating costs. Moreover, our competitors might acquire smaller players in our markets, further strengthening their position in the market.

We may be accused of anti-competitive practices based on our conduct and taking into account our market position. Any such claims could materially adversely affect our reputation, potentially result in legal proceedings that could have an impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations and require us to divest assets. Such claims could also impair our ability to conduct acquisitions accretive to our business. For example, in 2023, we were part of a CMA fuel pricing market study which resulted in a fine to Asda related to the delayed provision of information. Before certain potential future acquisitions can be consummated, we may also be required to seek approvals and consents from regulatory agencies or there may be applicable waiting periods that will need to expire. We may be unable to obtain such regulatory approvals or consents, or, in order to obtain them, we may be required to dispose of assets or take other actions that could have the effect of reducing our return on potential future acquisitions. For example, in order to address competitive concerns raised by the CMA, we agreed to divest 13 sites in connection with the Arthur Acquisition. Even if regulatory authorities do not require disposals or other actions, the regulatory approval process may have the effect of delaying our ability to implement potential future acquisitions.

We cannot guarantee that the coverage limits under our insurance programmes will be adequate to protect us against future claims, or that we will be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future, or at all. Our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be materially adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable, or there is an increase in the liability for which we self-insure, or we suffer harm to our reputation as a result of an error or omission. We are subject to numerous government regulations. Each of our in-store pharmacies must be registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council (or the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland in Northern Ireland). Additionally, before a registered pharmacy can dispense prescriptions under the National Health Service, it must be included in the pharmaceutical list relating to a Health and Wellbeing Board Area, maintained by NHS England, NHS Scotland or NHS Wales and maintained by the Family Practitioner Services in Northern Ireland. In addition, pharmacies dispensing controlled substances are required to maintain records of sale and supply and report incidents to the NHS. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we could be in breach of professional standards and/or NHS terms of service, which could lead to a hierarchy of penalties up to and including the loss of such pharmacy’s registration. Each pharmacy therefore has a responsible pharmacist to ensure it operates in a safe and legal manner and corporate-wide this responsibility is shared by the Superintendent Pharmacist. Application of laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes to our operations.

We also generate revenue through providing NHS services, private services and the sale of over-the-counter medicines that can only be sold from a registered pharmacy by a pharmacist or a person acting under the supervision of a pharmacist. Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: changes in availability, pricing, and safety profiles of prescription drugs that we purchase and sell, changes in NHS reimbursement for prescription drugs; a reduction in the pharmacy global sum leading to reduced retained purchase margins available for pharmacy in England; a reduction in dispensing activity payments; the introduction of new NHS services; and a move away from reimbursement for dispensing prescription drugs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations, including online; overall economic conditions; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business. If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, we would in turn have to seek a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals, with related risks of shortages or delays in our own pharmacy operations.

We also have an online site supplying powered contact lenses under the “general direction” of a registered optometrist, suitably qualified dispensing optician or medical practitioner. The majority of our revenue is from the sale of spectacles and eye examinations. We are regulated by the General Optical Council (“GOC”). To operate in the United Kingdom and use the title “Opticians” we have to be registered as a Body Corporate with the GOC and therefore are subject to the GOC Business Standards as well as the Opticians Act 1989. It is a requirement of the GOC that any Body Corporates which do not have GOC registrants as the majority of their Board, must have a Responsible Officer (Superintendent Optometrist) in position. All Optometrists and Opticians also have to be registered with the GOC to be able to practice and they are subject to the GOC Professional Standards as well as the Opticians Act 1989. Breaches to the GOC standards could lead to warnings, fines, sanctions on practice up to being removed from the GOC register either as a business or individual and unable to practice. All of our optical departments also hold a contract with the NHS Integrated Care Boards or Health Board to be able to provide NHS services. Breaches of the terms within such contracts can lead to penalties, including up to revoking such contract and stopping us providing NHS services. These penalties can occur at the store level, regional level or national level. Since 78% of our eye examinations were funded by the NHS in 2023, any penalties or stoppage in NHS services would have a material adverse impact on our business. Our Optometrists in all four nations also have to be registered on an NHS performer’s listing to be able to provide NHS eye examinations. In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, some of our stores also conduct additional NHS services which are commissioned at a local level, which requires such stores to abide by additional NHS standard contracts with local service level agreements. In Wales, Optometrists also need to have Wales Eye Care Services (WECS) accreditation and completed Wales General Ophthalmic Services (WGOS) training to be registered as a performer on the NHS performers list. 69 ----- Changes in the regulatory environment for the optical industry and other changes in laws, rules, NHS contract terms and regulations may also have an effect on our operating and commercial model. The provision of professional eye care services entails an inherent risk of professional malpractice and other similar claims. We may become subject to professional malpractice regulatory or NHS actions or claims under various theories relating to the professional services provided by our departments. This could also lead to a public relations and/or reputational risk both at the local and national level. We may not be able to continue to obtain adequate liability insurance at reasonable rates, in which event, the cost could require us to exit this offering, as insurance is a regulatory requirement for both a Body Corporate and individual registrants. Furthermore, our insurance may not be adequate to cover claims asserted against us, thus, potentially decreasing our future cash position. If the glazing supply provided by our main Optical vendor was to be disrupted for any reason, our Optical operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could transfer to a new glazing manufacturer. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a number of our Optical customers transferring their purchases to other Opticians.

For example, from time to time, we and/or our management are involved in litigation, tax audits, claims and other proceedings related to the conduct of our business, including, but not limited to, claims from our current and former employees, claims of intellectual property infringement, claims from customers (such as for injuries at our premises), claims asserting unfair competition and unfair business practices by third parties and environmental, health and safety claims (including, for example, related to the presence of asbestos in any of our properties). We could face a wide variety of employee claims, including general discrimination, privacy, labour and employment and disability claims. For example, Asda Stores Limited has been served with approximately 52,923 employment tribunal claims (the “Equal Value Claims”) that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the “Employment Tribunal”) in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former Asda store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. There are also 8,147 claims filed in the High Court which are stayed pending the outcome of the Equal Value Claims. The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in Asda’s retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in Asda’s warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda’s retail stores with those of employees in Asda’s warehouse and distribution facilities. On March 26, 2021, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, that the work of hourly-paid workers in distribution centres and the work of hourly-paid workers in stores can be compared. The litigation is currently in the equal value stage when the Employment Tribunal Claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in Asda’s warehouse and distribution facilities. The equal value hearing is scheduled to take place from September 9, 2024 to December 13, 2024 at the Manchester Employment Tribunal. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance as to the 70 ----- scope and outcomes of these matters and any losses that may arise from these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See “Business—Legal _Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation.”_ Any claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory proceedings being brought against us by various governmental agencies. Often these cases raise complex factual, accounting and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time and legal expenses. Litigation and claims and regulatory proceedings against us or our management could result in unexpected expenses and liability and could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we were successful in defending such proceedings, we could still suffer from the distraction of management resources to such proceedings, incur certain expenses and possibly face harm to our reputation from case-related publicity. The involvement in litigation and arbitration proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.3,Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters,13.3.2,"We are subject to extensive, increasingly stringent and frequently changing laws and regulations and increased scrutiny from regulators and enforcement authorities, including in relation to advertising, food and product safety, health and safety matters and the environment, and both compliance and non-compliance therewith could impose substantial liabilities and costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.","In the ordinary course of our business, our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent laws and regulations relating to, among other things, labour, competition, imports and exports, advertising, customer protection, alcohol and tobacco licencing, supplier relations, planning approvals for the opening of new stores, business operations, product safety, intermediation in customer credit and insurance, information technology, store safety and accessibility and health, safety and environment. Moreover, some of our businesses are subject to specific regulations, compliance with each of which can be complex and costly or can result in significant cash outflows. These include compliance with marketing laws and regulations, compliance with pharmaceutical laws and regulations, compliance with optometry laws and regulations, compliance with e-commerce laws and regulations and compliance with real estate laws and regulations. Additionally, we are subject to, among other things: telecommunications regulation, both directly and indirectly; regulations that govern our relationships with our suppliers, limiting our operational flexibility; and labour and employment laws that regulate the human resources implications of any proposals to restructure our business, our colleagues’ working conditions, maximum working hours and, in certain jurisdictions, the ability to have stores open 24 hours a day or work on Sundays. We may be subject to audits and/or inquiries into our labour law practices by competent authorities and enforcement costs and penalties can be significant. Any claims could result in litigation against the Group and could also result in regulatory or legal proceedings and fines being brought against the Group. For example, in 2023, the CMA fined Asda £60,000 in connection with a market-wide fuel pricing market study. Often these cases raise complex factual, accounting and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time, legal expenses and exposure to financial penalty. In addition, the CMA introduced the Green Claims Code, and in 2022, launched investigations into George and other non-Asda apparel brands for eco-friendly and sustainability claims made about their fashion products, including clothing, footwear, and accessories. For more information see “Business— _Regulation—Competition and Markets Authority—Green Claims Code,” and “Business—Legal Proceedings— Environmental Claims Matter.”_ We are also subject to the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (“GSCOP”), a statute governing the largest UK food retailers which requires these retailers to treat their suppliers fairly, lawfully and in good faith. The proposed fines for breaching the legislation may be up to 1% of the breaching retailer’s turnover. Even if no fines are assessed, a finding of breach by the Groceries Code Adjudicator responsible for enforcing the GSCOP may cause negative publicity and damage our image, reputation or brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we are subject to the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 (the “Controlled Land Order”), which is legislation administered by the CMA and designed to limit the ability of large grocery retailers to prevent land being used by their competitors for grocery retailing in the future. Prior to the LBO Acquisition, we purchased our electricity on a wholesale basis via a dedicated subsidiary, which sold the electricity back into Asda. These electricity purchases are regulated by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (“OFGEM”), which is the government regulator for gas and electricity markets in Great Britain. Since 71 ----- March 2021, we have purchased our electricity on a retail basis facilitated through a third-party agent. Therefore, since the regulations relating to wholesale electricity purchases do not apply to the retail purchases made since March 2021, we have navigated the process of revoking the electricity supply license with the help of a consultancy firm. This process has confirmed that we have met of our obligations and we have no liabilities outstanding. In addition, we are subject to regulation by the Office of Communications (“OFCOM”), an independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries, which regulates selling practices for mobile telecommunication services and changes to mobile termination rates, among other things. The FCA is responsible for the regulation of insurance and customer credit-related activities in the United Kingdom. Firms carrying on such activities in the United Kingdom must generally be authorised by the FCA with appropriate permissions, and FCA authorised firms are subject to ongoing regulation and supervision by the FCA. In connection with distributing the Asda Money suite of white-labelled financial services products, Asda Stores Limited is authorised by the FCA with limited permission to carry out credit broking, and both Asda Stores Limited and Asda Financial Services Limited are registered with the FCA as introducer appointed representatives of a number of third-party insurance and credit product providers. Any failures in or inadequate controls around the customer introduction process for those regulated financial services products, or any technical deficiencies in the arrangements with such third-party insurance and credit product providers, could in principle result in regulatory investigations and related costs and penalties, as well as reputational damage. Additionally, as a retailer and manufacturer of food products for human consumption, we are subject to stringent production, packing, health, quality, labelling and distribution standards. Each of our stores and our suppliers’ facilities may be subject to licencing, reporting requirements and official quality controls by numerous governmental authorities. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain the necessary licences or approvals could delay or prevent the development or operation of a given retail location or distribution centre. Our stores and our distribution centres are subject to regular inspection by authorities for compliance with hygiene regulations applicable to the sale, storage and manufacturing of foodstuffs and the traceability of genetically modified organisms, meats and other raw materials. Should any non-compliance with such regulations be discovered during an inspection, authorities may temporarily shut down the store, distribution centre or facility concerned and/or result in prosecution and the imposition of a fine for such non-compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, we are subject to various environmental and health and safety requirements, including those governing discharges to water and air, waste disposal, the clean-up of contaminated sites, product content and labelling and worker health and safety. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up obligations, fines, penalties and other criminal and civil sanctions, and third-party claims for personal injury or property damage, as a result of violations of our liabilities under these requirements. For example, we own and operate service stations, which include significant storage of petrol, liquified natural gas or other hazardous materials, and many of our sites store fuel for use in backup generators and, as a result, we are subject to a variety of legislation governing the use, management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes and other regulated materials, such as petroleum and petroleum products, and any environmental impacts from current or historical operations at such locations. Our operations and facilities also require permits and authorisations under environmental, health and safety requirements, which are subject to renewal, modification and rescission by issuing authorities. We also may be required to incur substantial capital or other costs to comply with such requirements or those that are promulgated in the future. In addition, we could be sued for health problems caused by the use of tobacco products. In fact, various health related legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacturing, development, advertising and marketing of cigarettes have been brought against vendors of tobacco products in the United States. If this trend progressed to the United Kingdom, any unfavourable verdict against us in a health-related suit could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we may be notified of or otherwise become aware of additional laws and regulations that governmental organisations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. Compliance with future requirements could result in substantial costs to us. Failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could subject us to sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Future changes in such laws and regulations could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The laws and regulations to which we are subject frequently change, which may materially impact our business operations, and our failure to comply with such laws can result in significant fines and other penalties. See 72 ----- also “Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—We are subject to regulations relating to the implementation of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union.”_ As a general matter, legal requirements are subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. Failure to define clear roles and responsibilities or to regularly communicate with and train our colleagues may result in non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations. As is the case for other retailers of our size, we may from time to time be subject to inquiries or investigations from regulatory bodies by local authorities, competition authorities or financial regulators, in the ordinary course of our business. Such authorities may take the view that we have not conducted or are not conducting our business fully in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and, consequently, we may be required to make significant expenditures to defend against allegations of wrongdoing or modify our business practices to comply with differing interpretations of existing laws and regulations or with future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.

This means that new regulations are in place governing the import and export of goods between the United Kingdom and the European Union from this date which places a greater cost and administrative burden on us. For example, from April 30, 2024, physical, documentary and identity checks at the border are scheduled to be required for medium-risk animal products, plants and plant products, such as chilled and frozen meat, fish, cheese, eggs, dairy products and certain cut flowers and seeds, imported to United Kingdom from the European Union. There are also additional regulations in place governing tariffs for products of non-EU origin when they are exported across the border from the United Kingdom to the European Union which also can place a greater cost and administrative burden on us. The UK government may implement additional regulations governing trade movement into and out of the United Kingdom which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are a UK business. The Brexit administration requirements could mean that the United Kingdom will suffer as a result of losing commercially favourable access to the EU single market, or specific countries in the European Union, further resulting in a negative impact on the general and economic conditions in the United Kingdom and the European Union which could in turn have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, since we operate 18 stores in Northern Ireland, Brexit has had an additional impact on our business, results of operation and prospects due to new bureaucratic hurdles and the implementation of the Northern Ireland Retail Movement Scheme on October 1, 2023, which established a new framework for the movement of retail goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. Future changes may occur in regulations that we are required to comply with as well as amendments to treaties governing but not limited to tax, duties and tariffs, which could adversely impact our operations and require us to modify our financial and supply arrangements.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, process and in some cases store certain personal financial and other information about our customers and colleagues (some of which may be sensitive, such as information about customers’ dietary preferences or restrictions), marketing initiatives and the large number of credit and debit transactions we process. For example, we use our Asda Rewards loyalty programme to leverage data insights about our customers for targeted investment in our business. We also process sensitive information about our colleagues, including their bank details, union membership and health status. We must therefore comply with strict data protection, privacy and security laws and regulatory guidance. In order for our business to function successfully, we must process personal data, including credit and debit card information in an adequately secure manner. In addition, our online operations depend heavily upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. We rely on 73 ----- third-party service providers to process customer payments made using debit cards and credit cards. See also “Risks _Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—We are exposed to payments risks, including processing risks, increases in transaction fees, actions taken by third parties that could disrupt our operations, failure by us or third parties on whom we rely to fully comply with rules and standards governing payment processing, and system failures and security breaches.”_ The use and handling of this personal information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations at the national and international levels, as well as by certain third-party contracts. The legal and regulatory frameworks governing the use and handling of personal information are relatively new in our markets and are still evolving. Any failure or perceived failure by us or any of our third-party service providers to comply with our policies or with any other privacy related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations could materially adversely affect our reputation and brands and may result in claims, fines (including by card merchants), civil or criminal proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. For example, we are subject to the UK GDPR which became applicable on January 31, 2020. The UK GDPR is almost identical to the EU GDPR, which strengthens existing rights, provides for new rights and gives customers and colleagues increased control over their personal data, including the requirement for data collectors to process and use personal information solely for the reasons for which they were collected. Laws, such as the UK GDPR, restrict our ability to collect and use personal information relating to individuals including the use of that information for marketing purposes. We rely on our own colleagues to maintain our databases and seek to ensure that procedures are in place to ensure compliance (including that we maintain proper privacy notices). Non-compliance with the UK GDPR could result in a possible fine of up to either £17.5 million or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, for the most serious infringements. See also “Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our _General Operations—We may suffer a loss as a result of operational risk, including human error, ineffective or inadequate designed processes, failure of IT or other systems, improper conduct by colleagues and third parties, failures by suppliers and third-party providers and criminal activity including fraud, theft and cybercrime.”_ Moreover, even if we are compliant with such laws and requirements, we may not be able to prevent security breaches involving customer transaction data. If we or any of our third-party service providers fail to transmit customer information in a secure manner, if our security and information systems are compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, a cyberattack or a network security incident, or if our colleagues or certain third-parties fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations (and, as a result, information about our customers and colleagues is obtained by unauthorised persons or used inappropriately), we may be subject to the aforementioned consequences, all of which may significantly adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, customer protection and the digital advertising business are evolving and subject to potentially different interpretations in different jurisdictions.

For a description of our material insurance policies, see “Business—Insurance.” Given the number of locations and settings in which our colleagues provide services and the range of activities our colleagues engage in, we may not always be able to foresee accurately all activities and situations in order to ensure that they are fully covered by the terms of our insurance policies and, as a result, we may not be covered by insurance in specific instances. While we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all risks are insured or insurable. As a result, we cannot guarantee our insurance programmes will be adequate to cover future claims or operating losses incurred as a result of accidents resulting from fires, explosions, water damage, theft, political unrest, natural events causing damage to our property (buildings, furniture, equipment, merchandise or computer systems) or following a business interruption at our premises, nor that we will be able to maintain our insurance programmes on acceptable terms in the future. 74 ----- We typically renew our insurance on an annual basis. In connection with this renewal process, our insurance costs may increase following the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages, in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. The occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages in a calendar year may have a material adverse effect on our insurance premiums. Furthermore, given a recent change in our credit ratings, our providers required that we offer additional financial security for a portion of the deductible amounts payable by us under our policies, which has increased the overall costs of carrying insurance. If we are not able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost or if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or unavailable in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Our insurance coverage may not cover all risks, and there are some risks that may only be covered to a limited extent due to limits in our insurance policies. For instance, we may incur losses that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates underlying our reserves for such losses could result in significantly higher expense than anticipated, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

A variety of organisations evaluate, and measure the performance of, companies on such ESG matters, and the results of these assessments are widely publicised. For example, many investment funds focus on positive ESG business practices and sustainability scores when making investments and may consider a company’s ESG or sustainability scores as a reputational or other factor in making an investment decision. If our ESG practices do not meet investor, customer, or employee expectations, which continue to evolve, our brand, reputation, and customer and employee retention may be negatively impacted.

These risks and uncertainties include our ability to achieve our goals, commitments, and targets within the currently projected costs and the expected timeframes; unforeseen operational and technological difficulties; the outcome of research efforts and future technology developments; and the success of our collaborations with third parties. It is possible that stakeholders may not be satisfied with our ESG reporting, our ESG practices or our speed of adoption. We could also incur additional costs and devote additional resources to monitor, report and implement various ESG practices. Any failure, or perceived failure, to achieve our ESG goals, commitments, and targets could damage our reputation and customer, investor and other stakeholder relationships, and may even result in regulatory enforcement action.

Our future results of operations from international sales of the George Clothing products could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control.

Additionally, following the Separation, pursuant to the TMA, Walmart has granted us a licence to continue to use the George brand within the United Kingdom (for sale, marketing and distribution purposes on an exclusive basis) and outside the United Kingdom in certain specified countries in Europe (on a non-exclusive basis) granted us a licence to use the George brand (on a non-exclusive basis) in certain other territories outside the United Kingdom and such specified European countries in substantially the same way and to the same extent as the brand was used by Asda immediately prior to the date of the LBO Acquisition Agreement, as specified in, and subject to the terms of, the TMA, in each case on and subject to the terms of the TMA.

Changes in (or changes in interpretations of) tax treaties, tax laws or regulations or tax authority guidance could materially adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments, possibly with a retroactive effect. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors in addition to our results of operations, accounting standards and changes in accounting standards, and future changes in the law. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations or our effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, in the United Kingdom, if the tax authority concluded that VAT was chargeable on a particular supply on which we did not charge VAT to customers, we would be liable to account for such VAT. The occurrence of any of 76 ----- the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In the jurisdictions in which we operate, governments might centrally adjust the value of business rates in the property market. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the government adjusts the value of business rates to reflect changes in the property market approximately every five years. The most recent revaluation came into effect in England, Scotland and Wales on April 1, 2023 (based on rateable values from April 1, 2021). At revaluation, all properties are given a new rateable value which, depending on the underlying movement in the value of the property, can have an adverse impact on the tax liability due on the property. Adjustments to business rates could result in increased costs and consequently could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, legislation has been enacted or is currently under consideration in a number of jurisdictions to adopt and implement Pillar Two of the base erosion and profit shifting (“BEPS”) project initiated by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”), which is designed to introduce a global minimum tax rate of 15% for certain multinational groups. In December 2021 and March 2022, the OECD published model rules and related commentary to support member jurisdictions of the G20/OECD Inclusive Framework on BEPS (including the United Kingdom) to implement the Pillar Two framework. For example, the United Kingdom government has legislated to implement the Pillar Two income inclusion rule by introducing a “domestic top-up tax” and a “multinational top-up tax” for certain large multinational and UK groups for accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2023. The legislation applies to certain multinational and UK groups with annual group revenue exceeding €750 million. Broadly, the “domestic top-up tax” may be assessed inter alia on UK located qualifying entities of a qualifying group where the effective tax rate (“ETR”) of all UK members of the relevant group is less than 15%. Further, the “multinational top-up tax” may be assessed inter alia on a UK responsible member (typically, the ultimate parent, or where the ultimate parent is not in a territory which has implemented Pillar 2, the most senior group member in such a territory) of a qualifying multinational group where members have an ETR of less than 15% (as determined under the applicable rules) to the extent that a qualifying domestic top-up tax has not otherwise been collected. Based on initial analysis undertaken by the Group, the Pillar Two transitional safe harbour is expected to apply for each relevant territory and an election will be made such that no top-up tax charge is expected to arise in respect of the accounting period ended December 31, 2024. If this were not to be the case, and the ETR of the Pillar Two group members were to be at any point less than 15%, it is possible that Pillar Two top-up taxes could be assessed on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and/or other members of the Group. Further changes related to Pillar Two are expected to be implemented in the United Kingdom and in other jurisdictions in which we do business.

Each of Ernst & Young LLP and KPMG LLP has undertaken its audit work, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, to state to the Senior Notes Issuer’s members those matters that it is required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. Investors in the Senior Secured Notes should understand that these statements are intended to disclaim any liability to parties (such as purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes) other than to the Senior Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries with respect to those reports. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the limitation above, the recourse that investors in the Senior Secured Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which auditors have responsibility or liability to third parties is unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, and the legal effect of these statements in the audit reports is untested in the context of an offering of securities.

We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the third-party valuation report of our portfolio of real estate assets are correct, accurate or complete.","Property valuations are inherently subjective and uncertain and are based on assumptions which may prove to be inaccurate. We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the third-party valuation report of our portfolio of real estate assets are correct, accurate or complete. As a result, the valuation report presents the external valuer’s best estimate of the value of the Group’s properties subject to the assumptions and Special Assumptions set out above. This Offering Memorandum refers to the CBRE Report with respect to certain of the real estate portfolio owned by Asda. Valuation of property and property-related assets is inherently subjective and uncertain, in part because all property valuations are made on the basis of information and assumptions which may not prove to be accurate, and in part because of the individual nature of each property. Property valuations are complex, involve the use of data which is not publicly available and involve a degree of subjective professional judgement by the valuers. In valuing properties, the valuers are required to make certain key assumptions in respect of matters including, but not limited to, the existence of willing buyers, title to the property, condition of structure and services, deleterious materials, environmental matters, legal matters, statutory and regulatory requirements and planning, estimated market rental values, market-based yields, expected future rental revenues from the property, where relevant potential future trading performance, and other factors. In respect of properties which may require development, redevelopment or refurbishment, the development considered achievable, assumed timescale, the assumed future development cost and an appropriate finance rate and profit rate and/or discount rate are also used to determine the property value together with market evidence and recent comparable properties where appropriate. The adoption of different assumptions would be likely to produce different valuation results. The assumptions made may prove to be inaccurate or not borne out by future events and could negatively affect the valuation of the properties. The CBRE Report was furthermore produced on a desktop basis and without visual inspection of Asda’s properties. Where properties have not been inspected, the valuer will not carry out the usual range of enquiries performed during a full inspection of properties and will make the appropriate assumptions based on the information provided or available that, without a full inspection, cannot be verified. The instructing parties have acknowledged and accepted the heightened and inherent uncertainty and risks relying upon a valuation prepared on a desktop basis. The CBRE Report is thus based on information provided by management and certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, the assumptions that (i) our properties are not adversely affected by any existing or proposed environmental law and are free from, environmental issues such as contamination, deleterious materials, flooding, ground conditions, invasive or protected plants or species and the properties are not adversely affected by any existing or proposed 78 ----- environmental law, (ii) there are no abnormalities as to repair and condition of the properties, all properties are free from defect, in good repair and condition and well maintained and in marketable condition, compliant with all building, accessibility and fire safety regulations and there are no abnormalities as to repair and condition of the properties, (iii) properties possess a good and marketable freehold title free from any onerous restrictions or conditions, and all title, tenure, lettings, planning, taxation, statutory and local authority requirements are complied with, (iv) all properties benefit from full access and egress rights together with sufficient parking and loading facilities and are connected to all main services, (v) the floor areas supplied by Asda comply with the RICS Code of Measuring Practice (vi) no capital expenditure is required in respect of the properties and (vii) that the properties all have valid energy performance certificates compliant with the relevant regulations in each jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. In particular, CBRE has assumed each property to be the authorised use under planning legislation and in accordance with the use registered with the relevant regulatory agency. During the course of their engagement, CBRE did not perform site inspections, environmental audit, tests of services and amenities, investigations or tests as to the condition of the properties. CBRE did not make planning or permitting enquiries and did not examine deeds, leases or other documents relating to the title to our properties. The valuation assumed that the properties were in a reasonable state of condition without material capital expenditure required. The CBRE Report was prepared as at the valuation date of December 31, 2023 and is not as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. CBRE has not been requested to update or revise any of the information contained in the CBRE Report as of any later date or the date of this Offering Memorandum, is not under any obligation to do so and nor will it be asked to do so prior to the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes or at any later date. Accordingly, the information included in the CBRE Report may not reflect the current physical, economic, competitive, market or other conditions with respect to the Group properties. Your attention is drawn to the fact that in respect of the Supermarket, Industrial, Office and Food to Go Portfolios, the CBRE Report was additionally prepared upon the Special Assumption that the properties were let up on leases of 15 – 25 years rather than their current status of being held with vacant possession. The Special Assumptions are defined by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) Valuation – Global Standards (2022) as “an assumption that either assumes facts that differ from the actual facts existing at the valuation date or that would not be made by a typical market participant in a transaction on the valuation date.” We cannot assure you that the assumptions or projections used, estimates made or procedures followed in the CBRE Report are correct, accurate or complete. CBRE provided its valuation of the relevant properties as of at the valuation date of December 31, 2023 and it does not take into account subsequent events. Accordingly, the information included in the CBRE Report may not reflect the current physical, economic, competitive, market or other conditions with respect to the property portfolio. CBRE have accepted no responsibility to any third party for the whole or any part of the contents of the CBRE Report. Other appraisers may reach a different valuation of Asda’s property portfolio. Moreover, the values determined in the CBRE Report could be significantly higher than the amount that would be obtained from the actual sale of the properties included in the Group Portfolio, especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario, if a sale of the Properties is not subject to the assumptions or Special Assumptions in the CBRE Report, sale of a number of properties in a portfolio, in the event of a downturn in the local, regional or national real estate market. Accordingly, the CBRE Report should not be considered a representation of the actual present or future value of Asda’s property portfolio. The realisable value of the applicable property portfolio at any given time will depend on various factors, including: - macroeconomic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere; - an economic downturn; - potential changes to the competitive landscape for grocery retail; - capital expenditure requirements; - changes in occupier and investor demand; - supply and demand generally affecting pricing; - adaptability or obsolescence; 79 ----- - regulation (e.g., minimum energy efficiency standards); - changes in consumer behaviour and shopping habits, either organic or as a result of any other event listed above or elsewhere under these “Risk Factors”; and - other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, we anticipate that the value of Asda’s property portfolio will change over time, and it may change materially.

Effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to operate successfully as a business. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. If our internal controls do not keep pace with the size and sophistication of our businesses and the applicable financial reporting framework, or we fail to successfully integrate the businesses we acquired as part of the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition, we may not be able to implement and maintain adequate internal controls.

Prior to the LBO Acquisition, the Asda Group was historically part of the operations of Walmart, which provided us with operational, financial, and other support, and certain of our accounting and information technology systems were incorporated in Walmart’s larger operations. As a result of the LBO Acquisition, we became a standalone company and, accordingly, we have had to develop and implement the systems and infrastructure necessary to support our current and future business. On the LBO Acquisition Completion Date, Asda Stores Limited and Walmart entered into the TSA, under which Walmart undertakes to provide certain information technology services to Asda on a transitional basis (the “Transitional Services”). The Transitional Services include continuity of IT and communication services and provide support and facilitate our ability to operate on a standalone basis. Under the TSA, each relevant Transitional Service is to be supplied by Walmart until the earlier of (i) the migration of the relevant service as part of the separation of Asda from Walmart, and (ii) the termination of the TSA by Walmart or Asda Stores Limited under certain circumstances as described under “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements _with Walmart—Transitional Services Agreement.” If Walmart terminates the TSA in accordance with its terms or is_ unable or unwilling to provide the Transitional Services as agreed, we may not be able to replace these services at an acceptable price and in a timely manner, or at all. The Transitional Services include certain IT services which are provided pursuant to third-party vendor contracts. These services will require the vendor consent to extend the term of the underlying agreement past the LBO Acquisition Completion Date, and thereafter will have to be renegotiated with the IT vendor. 81 ----- The complexity of our new IT system and of its implementation means that we may not be able to successfully transition the systems to our standalone operations under Project Future. See “Risks Relating to Our Business and _Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarise results and manage our business. These systems are interdependent and disruptions in the IT infrastructure that we use could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.” Any failure to transition successfully within the terms of the applicable Transitional Agreement(s) may_ cause us to incur substantial expenses in addition to the anticipated separation costs and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. At the LBO Completion Date, Walmart and the LBO Seller also entered into several other transitional agreements with various entities within the Asda Group alongside the TSA. The Transitional Agreements include a TMA which includes licences of the George, Scan & Go, Smart Price and Rollback trademarks, certain domain names, including George.com, as well as certain other Walmart-owned trade mark rights used by a member of the Asda Group between October 2019 and the LBO Acquisition Completion Date. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party _Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart” for a description of the Transitional Agreements that are still_ in place. In the event any of our service relationships and agreements with Walmart are terminated, we may find it difficult to find a suitable alternative supplier of such services in a timely fashion or at all.

Delays or issues could lead to additional cost which impacts profitability. Furthermore, certain acquired contracts may have terms and conditions that are weaker than our standard contracts, and we may not be able to integrate or update them as quickly as we would like or without incurring significant fees. In addition, we may not have, or be able to retain or hire, employees with the appropriate skill sets for the tasks associated with our integration plans, particularly in the expected time frame in which we require them, and could experience employee departures and early retirement due to relevant business changes, all of which could adversely affect the success of the integration plans. In particular, the loss of key managers or other experienced and knowledgeable local employees, may result in the loss of knowledge and continuity for the relevant business. The integration process for our acquisitions, if implemented ineffectively, would restrict the realisation of the full expected benefits, including cost savings and synergies. Failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating these businesses into our existing business and to realise the anticipated benefits therefrom could cause an interruption of, or a loss of momentum in, our activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation. In order to fully integrate the financial accounting systems of our acquired businesses, we will also have to complete the implementation of our own standalone IT system. Prior to the completion of Project Future, the businesses acquired from the Arthur Acquisition are being migrated onto the IT systems of EG Group. Both the Arthur Business and the EG UK Business will remain on the IT systems of EG Group for a transitional period, after which, they will have to be transitioned onto our new system. This has required, and will continue to require, additional capital investments by us, and may require incremental resources and system configurations that could increase our operating costs in future periods, as we continue in our ongoing efforts to adjust our control environment to the standards of a business of our size and scale. See also “—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating _to Our General Operations—We may from time to time pursue acquisitions, which may prove more costly than anticipated and may not generate anticipated synergies and which may have an adverse impact on our business, as could our failure to successfully integrate such businesses following acquisition. Our business could also be negatively impacted by merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by supranational and national laws and regulations.”_ In connection with these acquisitions, we may also face risks related to unforeseen legal or regulatory issues as we expand our fuel and convenience operations, difficulty in consolidating facilities and infrastructure, and a diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the need to deal with the foregoing disruptions and integration matters. 82 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

A variety of risks could cause us not to realise some or all of the expected benefits. These risks include, among others, unexpected costs associated with operating our business, inability to eliminate duplicative back-office overhead or redundant selling and general and administrative functions and an inability to avoid labour disruptions in connection with any integration of the foregoing. Our ability to successfully manage organisational changes is important for our future business success. In particular, our reputation and results of operations could be harmed if colleague morale, engagement, or productivity decline as a result of organisational or other changes. Moreover, our implementation of these initiatives may disrupt our operations and performance, and our estimated cost savings from these initiatives are based on several assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we will realise these cost savings. If, for any reason, the benefits we realise are less than our estimates, or our improvement initiatives adversely affect our operations or cost more or take longer to implement than we project, or if our assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. These actions may not provide the expected benefits, or could take longer to achieve than expected, and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit key personnel, decline in colleague productivity, weakening of internal standards, controls or procedures, and impairment of key customer and supplier relationships. In addition, cost saving and operational efficiencies may not be able to be sustained due to changes in customer needs, changes in regulations, availability and cost of materials or other cost variables. Our anticipated cost saving and benefits from the EG UK Acquisition and Arthur Acquisition are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement cost saving measures in a timely fashion within certain cost parameters and implement net cost savings which are in excess of inflationary cost increases. Our ability to achieve planned cost saving and benefits of these acquisitions is dependent upon a significant number of assumptions, some of which may be beyond our control, including the development of the markets for our products and services, political, legal, fiscal, market and economic conditions including but not limited to cost price inflation through our supply chain, regulatory developments, and tariff and wage increases. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these measures proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realise fully or at all, or realise in the anticipated timeframe, the expected benefits from our cost saving and operational measures. We also undertake a number of group initiatives aimed at realizing synergies, operational efficiencies or cost savings. There can be no assurance that our acquisitions or any of these initiatives will be as successful or accretive as initially expected or meet our strategic goals. For example, we may fail to realise expected operational efficiencies or cost savings. There is also a risk that the synergies that we seek to achieve may not be realised within the time frame we currently anticipate, or at all, and that the magnitude of cost savings or operational efficiencies may be less than expected or the costs of achieving these synergies may be higher than expected.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realise or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterisation under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Enforcement of the Security Interests by the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realisation of security interests in collateral. For example, under English law, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The share pledges will be enforced by the Security Agent. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Initially, the Security Agent will not be required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing Group with a sufficient majority. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Group cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents when required to facilitate a sale of, or appropriate or otherwise foreclose on, the Collateral. For example, any change in the direct or indirect control of Asda Stores Limited will require the approval of the FCA.

It is possible that the market for the Senior Secured Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a holder of the Senior Secured Notes, regardless of the Group’s prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is no assurance that there will be an active trading market for the Senior Secured Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Senior Secured Notes at a fair value, if at all. Although an application will be made for the Senior Secured Notes to be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, the Group cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Senior Secured Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the Official List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the Senior Secured Notes as applicable, from the Exchange may have a material effect on a holder’s ability to resell the Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, in the secondary market. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could exacerbate the impact of a lack of sufficient liquidity of the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

If investors in the Senior Secured Notes measure their investment returns by reference to a currency other than sterling, such investment in the Senior Secured Notes will entail foreign exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the values of the pound sterling relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments because of economic, political and other factors over which the Group has no control. Depreciation of the pound sterling against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Senior Secured Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result in a loss to investors when the return on such Senior Secured Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which the investors measure the return on their investments.

In addition, as all of the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors, managers and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them. Moreover, actions of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors may not be subject to the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with England and Wales. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in England and Wales of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in England and Wales of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

The amount of cash required to be deposited depends on the percentage of stores operated on properties that are subject 94 ----- to the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction (“Portfolio Stores”) that are affected stores. Whether a store is an affected superstore is dependent on the sales performance of that superstore relative to all of the superstores we own.

Our shareholders may make strategic decisions with regards to their ownership of the Group that may not be aligned with the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. For instance, they may seek to acquire further ownership interests or dispose their existing ownership interests in the Group. Our principal shareholders may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, will enhance their equity investments, although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of Senior Secured Notes.

The incurrence of additional indebtedness could increase the Group’s debt service obligations, the payment of dividends would reduce the Group’s ability to meet its debt service obligations or fund working capital, capital expenditures or general corporate purposes and the sale of certain assets would reduce the Group’s ability to generate revenue, each of which could adversely affect holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

Our Treasury function seeks to ensure that we continue to have access to sufficient funding by, amongst other things, monitoring rolling forecasts of our cash flows, which includes our ability to service our debt obligations. We have sought to manage our liquidity through entry into short-term financing arrangements with a number of third-party financial institutions, including arrangements to allow a number of our suppliers to participate in supply chain finance (“SCF”) arrangements with such financial institutions. Such 97 ----- arrangements reduce pressure on supplier payment terms, allowing payments in respect of supplier invoices on longer payment terms and correspondingly increasing short-term liquidity. However, as these SCF facilities are uncommitted and the level of funding financial institutions provide pursuant to them is discretionary, there is a risk that these facilities will not be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs. A decision by one or more of these third-party financial institutions to reduce the amount of funding available pursuant to such SCF facilities or fully withdraw the access to such SCF facilities, or a disruption to one or more of the financial institutions providing such facilities, could adversely affect our cash flows and liquidity. The withdrawal of such facilities could lead to a review of payment terms by suppliers, with a significant reduction in payment terms to suppliers risking a working capital outflow. If these programmes or underlying supplier terms do not continue and we are unable to secure alternative programmes, our cash and working capital may be negatively affected and we may have to increase our long-term borrowings for short- and long-term liquidity requirements.

Levels of customer traffic at our stores are affected by the weather and travel patterns, among other factors, which could also have a negative impact on our cash position and impact our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund working capital and capital expenditures.

The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action.

Additionally, the Senior Facilities Agreement allows (or, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, will allow) the Group to incur additional indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes, which would further dilute the voting interest of holders of the Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date.

In addition, the share pledges over the shares of an entity may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. The Collateral is located in England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and the multi-jurisdictional nature of any foreclosure on the Collateral may limit its realisable value. For example, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially different from, or conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. In addition, third parties may have rights over Material Real Property (including rights to acquire and pre-emption rights) exercisable in the event of transfer of such Material Real Property (including as a result of enforcement of security interests in such Collateral).

The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, as the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favour of the Senior Secured Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness and a Permitted Reorganisation. Please see “Description of the Senior Secured Notes— _Security.”_ The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it.

Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after certain events, including the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned-over amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward discharging the super senior obligations (including, among others, (following the designation of the New Revolving Facility as super senior liabilities in 100 ----- accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) those under the New Revolving Facility, certain hedging obligations and supply chain financings that may, pursuant to the terms of the Indentures, be secured on a super senior basis (the “Super Senior Liabilities”) under certain circumstances, including the refinancing in full of the Term Loan Facilities) in priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging the Senior Secured Notes. As such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not benefit from such recoveries if the then-outstanding claims under such Super Senior Liabilities are greater than the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral will, after all obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities (other than the New Revolving Facility where a designation of the New Revolving Facility as super senior liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement has occurred) and any other obligations secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes. Furthermore, claims of other secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the Senior Secured Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. 101 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Overview,17.1.1,,"We are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom and the second-largest grocery retailer in the North of England, Scotland and Wales (in each case in terms of Till Roll data on a 52-week basis as of January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We operate a significant store estate of over 1,200 large stores and convenience sites that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom. We also have the second largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We are also now a major player in the UK convenience market, having added 472 convenience sites (including petrol filling stations) to our portfolio, as well as 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites), following the Arthur Acquisition and EG UK Acquisition. These acquisitions have given us significant foothold in the fast-growing convenience market which, alongside our existing fuel portfolio, makes us the second-largest independent fuel owner-operator in the United Kingdom. 108 ----- The graph below compares our total grocery market share with that of other major UK grocery retailers based on Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel. _(Source: Kantar Worldpanel, Take Home Panel, Grocery, 52 w/e January 21[st] 2024, Till Roll.)_ We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household expenditure on food and beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through economic fluctuations. Groceries are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed only by a slight contraction as the pandemic eased. Since, the UK grocery retail market has experienced consistent growth, achieving a record-high size of £144.0 billion in sales for the 52week period ended December 24, 2023, according to Kantar Worldpanel, despite facing high inflation and global geopolitical tensions in 2022 and 2023. See also “Industry.” One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is in turn centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to offering high quality products with low prices to our customers and our wholly-owned supplier, International Procurement and Logistics Ltd (“IPL”), which enables us to take a vertically-integrated approach to procurement and which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and well-established George Clothing and George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers, our growing presence in the convenience and foodservice market, our popular customer loyalty programme Asda Rewards, and our team of flexible and engaged colleagues. We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenue was £25.6 billion (including fuel), with 16.5% of sales made online, our net cash flow from operating activities was £1,245.8 million, our profit for the year was £194.5 million, and our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was £1,264 million. 109 ----- Excluding the results of the EG UK Business, which was acquired on October 31, 2023, and the results of the Arthur Business, which was consolidated from May 31, 2023, the chart below presents the breakdown of our 2023 revenue by product category (food, general merchandise, clothing and petrol), and channel (stores and online (including George.com)). _(Source: Asda information. Year ended December 31, 2023. Note: excluding approximately £588 million from the Arthur Acquisition, £411 million from the EG UK Acquisition and £199 million of other revenue from Asda Mobile sales, financial services sales, shipping and wrapping revenue, pharmacy revenue and, until the EG UK Acquisition, Asda On The Move.)_ Our differentiated operating model has resulted in strong financial performance: our successful financial profile is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditure KPI) and cash conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. For more information on our differentiated operating model, see “—Key Strengths—We benefit from a differentiated operating model.”_ Between 2021 and 2023, our average profit margin (defined as profit for the year divided by revenue) was 4.3%, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.2% (including fuel), our cumulative cash flows from operating activities totalled £3,340.6 million, cumulative free cash flow was approximately £2,097 million and our average cash conversion was 68%. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial _Data—Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_ We believe that our business, operating model and financial performance also benefit from our significant freehold real estate asset portfolio, which also can provide a potential source of liquidity. See “Valuation Report.” In 2023, through the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and 2023 Ground Rent Transaction, we have been able to, and in the future may continue to, selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to take advantage of favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities. See “—Lease Agreements.” We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we maintain a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom. We have made more than £300 million annualized price investment since 2022 across over 1,200 lines. Within the UK value market, we have strong market shares across core grocery products (13.1%), beers, wines and spirits (12.8%), impulse grocery (12.1%), household and pet (12.1%), frozen (11.4%) and total grocery (11.4%) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). Our offer is strong across the full food basket: our category market shares range from 9.6% to 13.1% (except health and beauty)(in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal 110 ----- Asda data, our prices are approximately 2.5% to 6.1% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on the average of the first eight weeks in 2024, based on total goods price gap percentage). We believe our prices continue to compete with those of discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. In January 2024, we launched a new price matching programme where we have price matched Aldi and Lidl on approximately 300 comparable grocery products, which reduced prices by an average of 17% to match whichever discounter had the lowest price on these products. Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is supplemented by a large clothing and general merchandise business. We offer our entire range of food and non-food products to customers as an accessible “one-stop shop” experience that is supported and enhanced by our strong online offer and expansion into the convenience market under the Asda Express banner. We believe our omni-channel offer, through which we reach customers at our brick-and-mortar stores and through our significant online offering and on our app, appeals to our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic increased use of and engagement with our online platforms. In the first half of 2021, there were approximately 8.6 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with order growth from approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended February 28, 2020) to an average of more than 773,000 weekly orders in 2021 (based on the average weekly orders for the first 26 weeks of 2021) and a peak of more than 850,000 orders during the third lockdown (based on the seven days to January 15, 2021). Online engagement has fallen from the peaks experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have continued to grow our online business, with an average of approximately 774,000 weekly orders in 2022 and 2023 (based on the average weekly orders in 2022 and 2023). We also offer at-home delivery and customers are able to collect their purchases at one of approximately 460 Asda Click & Collect sites. Our business model integrates our store-based and online offer by leveraging our stores to fulfil online orders. Our online grocery business is profitable within one of the world’s most developed online grocery markets. According to Kantar Worldpanel, as of January 21, 2024, we operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, holding 19.3% of market share (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales), growing our market share in a market that is 5.5% larger on a one-year basis (comparing Total Grocery Absolute Online Sales from the 52 weeks ended January 22, 2023 to the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024). Our online business is already of significant scale; the chart below shows the growth of our online sales, including a breakdown of online grocery versus George.com sales, for the periods presented. _(Source: Asda information.)_ According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the third-largest online clothing, footwear and accessories retailer in the United Kingdom by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024 and we held 8.5% of the total UK online clothing, footwear and accessories market by volume for the 24 weeks ended January 7, 2024. Combined sales for our online grocery business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion (of which £1.5 billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £3.6 billion in 2023 (of which £3.2 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR of 16.2% between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, our ‘toyou’ service allows customers to conveniently collect and 111 ----- return orders from George.com and other partner retailers at our stores. We have partnered with 112 brands and processed more than 4.4 million parcels in the year ended December 31, 2023. We also have a strong presence in the convenience market with significant opportunity for additional expansion in this fast-growing sector. In October 2022, we took our first notable step into the convenience market after acquiring 132 sites including 129 convenience sites attached to forecourts from the Co-op (the “Co-op sites,” and such business, the “Arthur Business”) and three development sites as part of the Arthur Acquisition. We agreed to divest 13 of the Co-op sites following the recommendation of the CMA after an Initial Enforcement Order stemming from its review of the acquisition. The disposals of these sites completed across December 2023 to January 2024 for proceeds of £25.2 million. Each Co-op site included a grocery retail store between 1,500 and 3,000 square feet of space and an attached petrol filling station driving footfall. In October 2023, we acquired the majority of EG Group’s business in the United Kingdom for total cash consideration of £2.1 billion (including transaction fees). The deal represented a major step in our convenience proposition, adding 356 well-invested PFSs to our convenience portfolio, 161 of which are stand-alone and 195 of which are co-located with foodservice concessions, as well as 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). In foodservice, we acquired franchises for some of the United Kingdom’s best loved outlets, including Greggs, Subway, Burger King and Sbarro, as well as our own proprietary brand, Leon. Certain of our acquired sites also continue to benefit from an additional KFC and Starbucks non-Group branded offerings operated by third parties. Through this acquisition, we accessed another high-growth sector, foodservice, tapping into a new market which is highly complementary to Asda’s current offering. Each of the acquired sites are community-focused and strategically located at the heart of residential areas with a diversified footprint across the United Kingdom, and represent broader retail destinations with ancillary services such as parcel delivery, car wash and last mile food delivery, with opportunity to expand further. The acquired sites also present a significant opportunity for further synergies across Asda’s business through higher volumes, buying synergies and cost savings through operational leverage. In September 2023, we began the conversion of the Co-op sites from Co-op branding to our Asda Express banner, implementing Asda pricing across fuel and grocery upon conversion. We completed the conversion of the remaining convenience sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in March 2024. Total capex investment to convert the stores to Asda Express was approximately £17 million. We believe we will be able to bring Asda’s great value to even more customers across the United Kingdom by reaching new communities and shoppers with this smaller store format. In the converted Co-op sites, our Asda Express prices were an average of 6.1% cheaper than their corresponding prices under Co-op ownership. We also have further organic Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in 2023 and a strong pipeline of approximately 40 sites that have been identified for potential opening in 2024. Going forward, our focus will be on the continued integration of the Co-op sites and EG UK Business into the Asda Group and delivering synergies. Currently, with our team of approximately 150,000 flexible and engaged colleagues, with around 98,000 fulltime employees, serving approximately 16.8 million customer trips each week (based on the average of weeks 37 to 40 of 2023), we are committed to and deeply invested in the UK food supply chain. Our business model is supported by diversification. First, we are a mass market retailer that serves the entire UK population, in terms of both customer demographics and geography, with our customer base skewing slightly towards value-seeking families, younger shoppers and lower-income customers who are attracted by our strategy to offer high quality products at low prices and with strong market shares in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. For more information about our customer mix, see “—Our Customers,” and for more information about the geographic distribution of our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.” Second, we believe we are well-positioned geographically, with a strong regional footprint across the United Kingdom. Our store footprint is strongest in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Our large and diverse store estate offers customers a variety of differentiated shopping formats. We operate 30 supercentres, 396 superstores, 153 supermarkets, 30 Asda Living stores, 499 convenience sites (including our petrol filling stations) and 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). For more information on our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.” We continue to benefit from certain support provided by Walmart through the Transitional Agreements, primarily in relation to the continued use of its IT platform. We have set up a dedicated team to facilitate the transition of our IT environment away from the Walmart ecosystem and onto a stand-alone IT solution, which we refer to as Project Future. We believe Project Future presents significant opportunities in terms of our efficiency, data capabilities, customer experience and competitive edge and are targeting complete separation from Walmart by the 112 ----- end of 2024. See “—Our Technology and Information Systems,” “Certain Relationships and Related Party _Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions— Delays in our ability to separate from Walmart could result in significant cost and any issues with the separation process, particularly related to our transition to a new IT system, could significantly disrupt business operations and impact our ability to meet our strategic objectives.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.1,Competitive Environment,"We operate in the highly competitive UK grocery retail market, which we believe is undergoing a period of significant structural change, characterised by factors such as strong growth and aggressive pricing on the part of discounters (such as Lidl and Aldi) as well as the other traditional grocers, and a shift away from large brick-and-mortar stores to online purchasing and convenience retail, all against the backdrop of the general political and economic uncertainty, including high inflation and the ongoing war in Ukraine, and any lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the latter of which has accelerated many of these trends. In a highly competitive environment during a time of economic uncertainty, there is a risk we are unable to navigate changes in market structure or consumer shopping trends leading to failure to enhance brand value, an inability to execute our strategic plan and we could be exposed to loss of market share. Across all of our market channels, we compete with grocery retailers and other operators for customers, employees, locations, products and other important aspects of our business. Our success depends on our ability to satisfy customer needs more effectively than the competition. In order to do so, we have adopted a strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and compete effectively against them on range, quality, price, convenience of location and the overall shopping experience, among other things. We believe our market proposition is that we offer the greatest value in terms of the price and quality of our products. For example, through our M&S Taste Match campaign, hundreds of our products were voted “as tasty” or “tastier than” their M&S equivalents, while our recent Aldi and Lidl Price Match programme delivers a broad range of popular everyday products at discounter rates. Our market differentiation strategy focuses on optimising our product offerings, monitoring our mix of formats and store concepts, expanding into convenience formats, strengthening our brand identity and seeking out 113 ----- opportunities to increase omni-channel sales. Further, our strategy is based on what we believe to be a well-established own-brand grocery offering, our large and diverse store estate that caters to our customers’ different preferences and our deployment of digital tools and online platforms and innovation and a well-known and successful clothing and general merchandise brand, George. Competition may also affect the prices we charge for our products, which in turn impacts our revenue and margins, although this is usually experienced on a product-specific basis. For example, a competitor may cut its prices to attract footfall to its stores, which in turn may require us to respond with a similar price reduction. In January 2024, we announced a new price matching programme where we have price matched Aldi and Lidl on 287 comparable grocery products, which reduced prices by an average of 17% to match whichever discounter had the lowest price on these products. This Aldi and Lidl Price Match programme runs alongside our established customer value propositions, including Price Drop and Asda Rewards. We have also implemented various other strategic initiatives and investments in new product development, particularly low cost/high-quality options. For example, in May 2022, we launched a new grocery opening price point range, Just Essentials By Asda. The range replaced the existing budget offering, Asda Smart Price, expanding the range from approximately 160 to 272 products, with items reformulated and refreshed to offer optimum price and quality. Prices for most of our products are set on a national basis and, as a result of significant structural changes to the UK grocery market, there has been substantial pressure on profit and EBITDA margins across the industry, which has led market participants to engage in intense short-term promotional activity, particularly through multibuy offers, member pricing and selective price cuts. At the same time, we have also experienced an overall market trend of food and other input price inflation. For example, increases in the UK National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage, alongside voluntary wage increases to support workers in this high inflationary environment, have led to grocery market wage inflation. Moreover, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine led to significant pressures on the energy market, which further accelerated rising inflation. As a result, we and other grocers experienced input inflationary pressures relating to food prices, energy and fuel. Following the easing of COVID-19 lockdown measures across the United Kingdom in the first half of 2021, the increase in economic activity led to increased pressure across global supply chains, including in relation to labour shortages within the food manufacturing supply chain (including shortages of HGV drivers ), a lack of container capacity within global shipping, increases in wholesale energy prices, shortages of certain raw materials (including CO2); and increases in commodity prices which have resulted in input price inflation within the supply chain, and there is no assurance that such pressures will not further increase in the future. Sourcing and supply chain challenges could also be exacerbated through climate change and adverse weather conditions. We manage this input cost inflation in several ways, such as by using our bargaining power with suppliers, increasing or decreasing the prices of certain products to offset each other, through product re-engineering, for example by maintaining the same price point and altering the weight or recipe, but without compromising on quality and, in certain circumstances, passing through cost increases to consumers. In addition, we have also worked with suppliers to help alleviate the challenges arising from recent supply chain pressures. This has included using our own logistics network to support suppliers in the transportation of products from their manufacturing sites to our distribution centres, and amending ordering profiles to enable suppliers to better manage the efficiency of their production lines. These changes, however, have put pressure on our profit and EBITDA margins during the periods under review. Whilst the level input inflation as of the date of this Offering Memorandum has been reduced compared to 2022 and 2023, we expect input cost inflation to continue during the remainder of 2024. We also operate in the highly competitive UK clothing and footwear retail market through the George Clothing brand, which offers a wide variety of low cost, high-quality clothing and apparel for babies, children, men and women, including jewellery, footwear and hosiery selections. The George Clothing brand was the number three clothing, footwear and accessories retailer by volume of units sold in the United Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel, with strong margins as compared to food categories and strong online growth in the past three years. However, we face competitive challenges in the clothing and footwear retail market, including from competitors that continue to invest in their online and in-store presence. Such competitors target some of George Clothing’s key customer categories. We will continue to face steep competition on the basis of, among other things, the location of our stores; our website and mobile applications, and their respective design; the breadth, quality, style, price and availability of our merchandise; and the level of customer service offered. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations— _Competitive pressures in the apparel, footwear and homeware retail industries are high.” For a further discussion of_ 114 ----- our competitive landscape, market share and consumer trends in the UK grocery retail business, see “Industry—UK _Grocery Retail Market Competitive Landscape.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.4,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.4.2,General Economic Conditions in Our Geographic Markets,"Our core grocery retail business generated 84.2% of our total sales (excluding fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2023. The grocery retail business is generally relatively insulated from swings in demand related to general economic conditions because consumer purchases of grocery and non-grocery staples tend to be less discretionary than purchases in other retail categories. Certain of our other non-grocery offerings, on the other hand, are more correlated to discretionary spending, and therefore, are more susceptible to changes in general economic conditions. Such offerings, including George Clothing and general merchandise, generated 15.8% of our total sales (excluding fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2023. Notwithstanding the overall resilient nature of our core grocery retail business, consumer tastes and shopping practices are affected by specific economic conditions in the local markets in which we operate, as well as, to a lesser extent, global economic conditions. Such conditions include employment levels, inflation, GDP growth, average and minimum wage levels, real disposable income, currency exchange rates, consumer confidence and consumer willingness to spend. In addition, the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 resulted in national and local authorities mandating or recommending various restrictions and other measures throughout most of 2020 and the first half of 2021, including mandatory business restrictions and closures and social distancing, quarantine and lockdown measures. However, our grocery operations were classified as an essential business in all locations in which we operate and remained open to serve the needs of our customers. As a result, with many other stores closed and consumers often preferring to do as much shopping as they could in one place to minimise potential exposure to the virus, we experienced exceptionally strong sales during this time. These results were partially offset by other challenges during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as increased cleaning costs, supply chain delays, increased freight costs and wholesale energy prices and shortages of certain raw materials. While our operations have largely recovered from the impacts of COVID-19 and the worst of the outbreak is largely considered to be in the past, there could be additional outbreaks and there is a risk of continued disruption as a result of such outbreaks at locations within our supply chain, or other related disruption at suppliers. As the COVID-19 pandemic waned and related governmental measures were eased, the economy reopened and our results in 2022 and 2023 decreased from the highs experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, as the world emerged from the global pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked an energy crisis which further accelerated growing inflation and cost-of-living pressures have continued to create uncertainty for customers and businesses alike. When consumers are confident about current and future economic conditions, we believe our premium grocery offerings, some of which carry higher margins than core products, are more likely to attract shoppers and that customers with rising disposable incomes are more likely to make impulse purchases, which can be margin accretive and lift average basket sizes. Conversely, during an economic downturn, basket sizes may tend to decrease while frequency of trips increases as customers disposable income reduces and they carefully manage their spend within a more constrained household budget. Consumers may increasingly opt for cheaper alternatives, such as “discount” retailers, and we may record more purchases of our affordably-priced and attractive mid-tier and opening price point own-brand products relative to local and international third party branded goods. The high inflationary environment, however, can also drive revenue as a result of the price inflation of products, rather than solely relying on an increase in the volume of products sold. During times of economic stress, however, we believe our value proposition is also particularly appealing to customers and can further drive sales and volumes. As the current high inflationary environment persists, we are focused on initiatives to support our customers in the cost-of-living crisis and protect market share by investing in price and quality. For example, in April 2022, we launched our Dropped and Locked price campaign, which locked in the prices of a variety of products. As a result, prices on these products dropped by an average of 12% and locked until the end of 2022 to give customers certainty around their shopping in light of these cost-of-living pressures. While we expect the UK grocery market to remain resilient into 2024, we also expect customers to continue feeling the impact of cost pressures on their household budgets as they face a real wage decline, making it more important than ever that we continue to focus on providing our strong value offering in food and non-food to enable us to serve customers on any type of budget. Additionally, our expansion into the convenience market provides further opportunity as customers increasingly desire convenience and accessibility and represents progress towards our strategic objective to be accessible to customers. 115 ----- For a further discussion of the macroeconomic conditions in the UK grocery retail market and the trends affecting its growth, see “Industry.”",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

We now have an active strategy to penetrate the convenience market, which will accelerate following the acquisition of 356 PFSs and 124 standalone foodservice sites through the EG UK Acquisition and 116 convenience sites as part of the Arthur Acquisition. Following the trial of Asda On the Move, where we offered Asda-branded products at sites owned by EG Group, we recently launched the Asda Express brand for our standalone Asda owned and operated convenience sites. These Asda Express convenience stores stock up to 3,000 branded and own-label products to suit a broad range of customer needs. In December 2022, we opened our first two organic Asda Express stores. We also have further organic Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in 2023 (including five opened in the fourth quarter of 2023) and a strong pipeline of approximately 40 sites that have been identified for potential opening in 2024. The sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition have all been converted to the Asda Express branding. We believe that these store concepts will allow us to access the convenience market and are responsive to changes in our customers’ lifestyles. However, there can be no assurance that this venture into the convenience sector will be successful or profitable. The development of this convenience proposition will also require additional capital expenditures and may have a significant impact on our results of operations. We also anticipate £86 million of synergies stemming from incremental uplift to Asda’s margin from the EG UK Acquisition and the Arthur Acquisition. We expect to achieve these synergies from price investment in the fuel and grocery offering, which we believe will lead to in an increase in volumes and will in turn enable buying benefits across the Asda product portfolio. In addition, we expect synergies to arise from range optimisation, monetisation of customer data, our increased scale, in-store marketing income, improvement in fuel card terms and operational efficiencies. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully realise the expected synergies and benefits from the EG UK Acquisition and the Arthur Acquisition, or that the costs to realise these synergies and benefits will not be higher than anticipated. The integration of the EG UK Business and Arthur Business into the Group could also result in various challenges, including related to the integration of certain operating and IT systems, including point of sale systems and inventory processing systems, the loss of customers or key employees, diversion of management’s attention, the disruption of our respective ongoing businesses or possible inconsistencies in standards, procedures and policies. Furthermore, certain contracts may have terms and conditions that are weaker than our standard contracts, and we may not be able to integrate or update them as quickly as we would like or without incurring significant fees. In order to fully integrate the financial accounting systems of our acquired businesses, we will have to complete the implementation of our own standalone IT system. Prior to the completion of Project Future, the business acquired from the Arthur Acquisition is being migrated onto the IT systems of EG Group. Both the Arthur Business and the EG UK Business will remain on the IT systems of EG Group for a transitional period, after which, they will have to be transitioned onto our new system. If the TSA expires before we complete the implementation of Project Future or we are not able to successfully transfer onto our new IT platform, this could result in increased costs or a material disruption to the business. Project Future and the integration of the Arthur Business and EG UK Business have required, and will continue to require, additional capital investments by us, and may require incremental resources and system configurations that could increase our operating costs in future periods, as we continue in our ongoing efforts to maintain our control environment to the standards of a business of our size and scale.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Instead, our costs generally increase from period to period based on the sensitivity of certain costs to inflation. We are able to control some costs to a certain degree, such as those related to marketing and labour (via short-term contracts as well as adjustments to the number of hours our colleagues work), but must maintain sufficient sales levels to absorb the increase in our expenses in order to maintain or improve our retail margins. We have also been able to reduce overall costs by leveraging our vertically integrated procurement 116 ----- arm, IPL, which is a wholly-owned supplier that serves us exclusively and provides us with a cost price advantage by eliminating the “middle man” in our supply chain and sources goods such as fresh fruit and vegetables, flowers, cooked meats and wines. However, even after taking such actions, certain expenses such as rent, the price of food ingredients, energy costs, energy taxes and other direct and indirect taxation are outside of our control. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—We are vulnerable to cost inflation and fluctuations in the availability and price of food ingredients and products, commodities and packing material, as well as to fluctuations in the price of electricity and fuel and labour, transportation and manufacturing costs.”_ Labour costs represent a significant part of our cost structure. Whilst we can adjust the size of our workforce, where we have proposals to reduce our headcount, we have legal obligations to consult with colleague representatives (including trade unions) and engage other labour force actors before proposals can be implemented. The obligation to consult with colleague representatives may result in amendments to proposed reductions in headcount and therefore take time before we can implement such changes should they proceed. Additionally, we are subject to laws setting minimum wages. During the periods presented, the UK government increased the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage and we agreed to further wage increases to support our colleagues and ease inflationary pressures, which had an impact on our cost structure and generally increased our costs, although this has been in part offset by cost saving and efficiency initiatives. For example, in April 2023, we voluntarily increased our rate for hourly paid store colleagues to £11.00 an hour and further increased this in July 2023 to £11.11 an hour. For stores inside the M25 and around Greater London, our rate for hourly paid store colleagues increased to £12.28 an hour. The national minimum wage is due to increase to £11.44 an hour in April 2024, and we plan to give our colleagues an interim increase, with those inside the M25 and around Greater London receiving £12.61 an hour. In July 2024, we are proposing a further increase in pay to 120,000 of our colleagues which will increase the basic pay for retail workers to £12.04 an hour, with those at stores inside the M25 and around Greater London receiving £13.21 an hour. Overall, this is an 8.4% increase in pay from £11.11 in July 2023 to the proposed £12.04 in July, 2024. Any further increase in wages, energy, maintenance or any other input in our cost structure which is not mitigated, can also affect our results of operations. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General _Operations—Our failure to attract and retain qualified colleagues, increases in labour costs and social charges and other changes to wage regulations could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Our retail store network is largely mature; however, we regularly evaluate the performance of our stores and have repositioned and remodelled stores under new store concepts to improve our customers’ experience and respond to their changing preferences. For example, we have refocused capital expenditure on remodelling our existing stores, in particular to realign store space and offerings to enhance our customer proposition and better respond to customers’ shopping behaviour. In October 2020, we opened our first “sustainability store” at our Middleton superstore location, which is a concept designed to encourage customers to reuse and refill their products, allowing customers to bring and fill their own containers with products such as coffee, rice, pasta and other goods, as well as offering second-hand clothing and increased recycling options. We have since opened three further refill sections in our stores in Toryglen, York and Milton Keynes. We are also further responding to shifting customer preferences, who increasingly desire fast and accessible products, through our roll-out of our Asda Express convenience stores. See “—Convenience and Integration Strategies.” In addition to new, standalone store concepts, we have also invested in new “shop within a shop” concepts with our Big Asda Toyshop, which has its own merchandising and look and feel. We first trialled this concept in eight stores in 2022 and following strong sales, we are aiming to roll it out in an additional 121 stores over the next year. We generally incur initial and ongoing capital expenditure and pre-opening costs with each new grocery retail store and store concept. We have also dedicated significant investment into the expansion of our online grocery channel, Asda Groceries, our Click & Collect and ‘toyou’ parcel collection and return services, and rapid delivery services through Uber Eats, Deliveroo and Just Eat to access new and existing customers who are increasingly shopping online, a trend that accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to continue to target operating model improvements to our online channel supported by developments in our IT infrastructure and use data to help us better understand our 117 ----- customers. In August 2022, we rolled out our new loyalty programme, Asda Rewards nationwide, following trials in a number of stores earlier in the year. Asda Rewards provides customers with Asda pounds instead of points for their loyalty through an app-based scheme. Customers earn cash back on their shopping, with regularly updated missions and star products enabling extra savings. Asda Rewards grew to almost five million active users by the end of 2023 (over the prior 30-day period) and continues to deliver strong incremental sales for the Group, while also providing valuable insight into the shopping patterns of our customers.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

We believe it will continue to grow in the mid-term, fuelled by consumers shifting to online channels and at-home consumption, which accelerated following the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe our growth has been, and we expect our growth to continue to be in the medium term. According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the second-largest online grocery retail platform in the United Kingdom, holding 19.3% of market share (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) for the 52-week period ended January 21, 2024. The UK online grocery market is intensely competitive. We compete with traditional grocery retailers that are active in the online grocery retail market, including Tesco.com, Sainsburys.co.uk, Waitrose.com and Morrisons.com, as well as with new competitors in the online grocery market, including broad-reaching e-commerce companies such as Amazon, as well as pure online players like Ocado. In order to retain our competitiveness in the evolving UK online grocery market, we continue to develop innovative customer solutions, such as our Express Collection service which enables customers to place an order for collection within four hours while other grocers also explore rapid delivery offerings (e.g., Ocado Zoom, Sainsbury’s Chop Chop). Furthermore, we continue to invest in strategic partnerships that lead to innovation and that we believe will drive further increases in our market share, such as our partnerships with Uber Eats, Just Eat and Deliveroo which provide express and last-mile delivery options for convenience groceries. See “Business—Our Online Platform” and “Business—Our Tenants and Strategic Partners” for further detail. We believe these broad-ranging online options, and in particular our in-store picking model, has bolstered, and will continue to bolster, the performance of our online channel and our ability to adapt to shifting consumer demands.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

As part of the financing for the EG UK Acquisition, we utilised a portion of our real estate portfolio and entered into the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and 2023 Ground Rent Transaction. In the future, we may continue to selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to take advantage of favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities on attractive terms. Such transaction would have the effect of raising our interest expenses, which would depress net income. In accordance with IAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment), land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Property, Plant and Equipment was recognised at fair value on February 16, 2021 at the time of the original LBO Acquisition in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 3 (Business Combinations) which for the purposes of IAS 16 represents cost. These assets have subsequently been stated at deemed cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Items under construction are valued at cost and not depreciated. Depreciation is charged from the date that the assets are available for use on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. When an item is disposed of or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from its continued use, any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

We have commercialised our capabilities and years of learning derived from our retail experience to partner with various service providers who can deliver access to, among other services, new convenience and delivery channels, where we believe there are significant opportunities to serve our customers in new and appealing ways. For example, in 2023, we launched our first Deliveroo HOP site at the new ‘Asda Express’ convenience store in Tottenham 118 ----- Hale. Deliveroo HOP is the delivery service’s newest innovation that gives customers a speedier service and better product availability with a model of ‘HOP’ whereby partners own and manage sites while integrating Deliveroo’s Hop technology and leveraging Deliveroo’s logistics network. Certain partnerships have also allowed us to focus on our omni-channel proposition or expand our non-core grocery offerings. For example, in August 2023, we announced an exclusive collaboration with TV presenter Stacey Solomon for a homeware range, exclusively at George Home, that expands our reach to customers in the homeware channel across bath, bed, dining, living and accessories. In April 2022, we also launched a ‘pet zone’ in selected stores to help consumers pick up everything from pet insurance to accessories. In November 2021, we partnered with baby brands such as Mamas & Papas, Graco and Ickle Bubba in selected stores to expand our baby product and accessory offerings. Additionally, we have developed partnerships with general merchandise retailers, that leverage their authority in certain categories and will attract customers to our stores. For example, we recently expanded our partnership with jewellery and accessories retailer, Claire’s Holdings LLC which will bring its hair, cosmetics, and fashion accessories. We also use partnerships to elevate our brand. For example, in December 2023, we launched a Christmas advertisement featuring guest Chief Quality Officer Michael Bublé, who is strongly associated with Christmas and cheer. The advertisement had very positive reception, and we believe this marketing campaign is an example of how we can drive customers to reappraise us on quality, whilst reassuring them on price, and modernising our brand. Partnerships across our various channels will continue to be an important focus for us as we continue looking for new ways to reach existing and new customers and to capitalise on our customers’ growing desire for convenient lifestyles, whereby individuals seek to accomplish multiple missions at once.

Family groups represent a significant proportion of our customer base. As a result, our revenue has historically been comparatively higher during the Christmas and Easter periods. In general, revenue shifts due to weather tend to be relatively short-term, with impacts occurring within a given month, rather than across a quarter or a longer period. From time to time, we may also experience reduced sales revenue if inclement or severe weather reduces in-store footfall and impulse purchases, without concomitant offset by online sales. At the same time, adverse weather conditions, such as snow or flooding, can increase customer demand for our online offerings, although they can also adversely affect our ability to deliver products to customers. In this case, however, increased demand for online offerings would not likely offset reduced sales revenue in stores resulting from inclement weather. In general, our fixed costs, including labour expenses (other than related to seasonal workers), real estate leases and SG&A expenses, are more evenly distributed over the year. Additionally, our procurement and sourcing activities are also generally more evenly spread throughout the year, except for a build-up in preparation for the Christmas season and to a lesser extent a build-up in preparation for Easter in April. While our financial calendar generally aligns with our operational profile, we experience calendar effects when, for example, the number of trading days or payroll periods in a given period varies from period to period or year to year or certain holidays fall in different periods from year to year. As a result of the foregoing, comparisons of consecutive interim periods may not be a good indication of our performance, and the calendar effects we experience may have an impact on year-on-year comparisons of interim periods.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The agreement was entered into with Rothesay Life, and insures the long-term benefits of approximately 12,300 members of the Asda Group Pension Scheme. The buy-in transaction, which was enabled by a one-off final contribution by Asda of £0.7 billion and a loan facility made available by the Asda Group Pension Scheme’s sponsor, Asda Stores Limited (see 119 ----- below), has taken place ahead of a full scheme-buy-out that was completed in July 2021. The transaction removed future Asda Group Pension Scheme liabilities from the Asda balance sheet, simplifying the business. The buy-out means Asda Group Pension Scheme members have received an individual annuity policy, issued by Rothesay Life, which will pay members’ pension benefits in full. At the time of the buy-in, it was agreed that certain of the assets of the Asda Group Pension Scheme did not meet the criteria for transfer to Rothesay Life pursuant to the buy-in transaction and were retained by the Asda Group Pension Scheme (the “Illiquid Assets”). The sponsor of the scheme, Asda Stores Limited, agreed to make a loan facility available to the trustees in an aggregate principal amount of £467.0 million in 2019 with the principal purpose of providing liquidity to the Asda Group Pension Scheme to allow the trustees to pay the premium in full under the buy-in policy with Rothesay Life, and also to provide prudent reserves that are available to fund the operation of the Asda Group Pension Scheme up to completion of the buy-out and eventual winding-up (the “Pension Scheme",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Since completion of",17.5.1,The Acquisition Transactions,"We consolidate the results of operations of any acquired business in our financial statements from the acquisition date. The acquisition date is the date when the Group obtains control of the acquired business as defined by IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements. Therefore, our historical financial periods are not directly comparable to one another. For example, following the closing date of the EG UK Acquisition on October 31, 2023, the results of EG UK were consolidated into our results. Following the closing of the Arthur Acquisition in October 2022, the CMA implemented an IEO and consequently, management concluded that the restrictions imposed by the IEO meant that the Group did not obtain control of the Arthur Business at the closing date. On May 30, 2023, after accepting our proposed remedies of disposing of 13 of the acquired sites, the CMA lifted the IEO and the results of the Arthur Business were consolidated into our results from that date. Our results in 2023 have been impacted by the revenues and expenses of the acquired business starting from the relevant date when we started consolidated the results of the applicable acquired business, whereas prior comparative periods do not include the results of the acquired business. 120 ----- Moreover, if we incur additional debt or enter into new financing arrangements in connection with any acquisition, our financial condition and results of operations will be impacted such instruments and may differ from the historical financial condition and results of operations presented in this discussion. For example, on October 31, 2023, we completed the EG UK Acquisition, which was also funded, among others, with the proceeds of external indebtedness, including the Private Placement Facility and the America Bridge Loan, the latter of which was subsequently refinanced with the proceeds from the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction. Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations following the EG UK Acquisition were, and will be, impacted by debt interest costs and rental expenses and may differ from the historical financial condition and results of operations presented in this discussion. In addition, all historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Senior Notes Issuer and its consolidated subsidiaries. However, the financial results of the Senior Notes Issuer do not include a full year of trading in the year ended December 31, 2021, as it acquired the trading group Asda Group Limited part way through the year on February 16, 2021. As a result, results for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the Senior Notes Issuer consolidated group do not constitute a full comparative period.

Pursuant to arrangements agreed in connection with the LBO Acquisition Agreement, payments received by Asda Stores Limited under the loan facility that are attributable to the Illiquid Assets are required to be paid to Walmart. Accordingly, the risk and reward of the performance of the Illiquid Assets was effectively transferred to Walmart. To the extent that realisations from the Illiquid Assets are insufficient to cover interest and principal payments owing to Asda Stores Limited under the loan facility, Asda Stores Limited is obliged under a separate agreement to provide sufficient funding to the Asda Group Pension Scheme to enable the trustees to fund such shortfall. As the amount of such funding provided by Asda Stores Limited to the Asda Group Pension Scheme would be applied to repay the loan facility owing to Asda Stores Limited, the combined effect of such transactions would have no net impact on Asda Stores Limited. Asda Stores Limited reached an agreement with the trustees of the Asda Group Pension Scheme to make a cash contribution of £214.6 million to the Asda Group Pension Scheme on December 30, 2020.

This increase was due to growth in non-fuel sales, partly offset by an overall decline in fuel sales revenue, a result of the comparatively lower average selling price in 2023 compared to high and volatile prices in 2022. Revenue (excluding fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £21,898.4 million, an increase of £1,446.1 million, or 7.1%, compared to £20,452.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily a result of growing revenue across both food and non-food in the existing Asda business, whilst also reflecting the additional sales from the Arthur Business and the EG UK Business. The Group recorded particularly strong year on year growth in the first half of 2023, by comparison to the first half of 2022, as a result of the impact of weaker performance in the first half of 2022, following emergence from COVID-19 lockdowns and supply chain challenges. Sales in the second half of 2023 showed more modest growth, partly due to unseasonable weather in the summer and autumn, which impacted customer behaviour and created unpredictability, particularly in seasonal categories, which was partially offset by positive impacts following the launch of Asda Rewards in August 2022. Further commentary below provides detail on the performance of our key categories. _Food_ Food sales increased in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to year ended December 31, 2022, including impact of sales from the acquired businesses. The Group has continued to invest in its food proposition in 2023, building on the success of the launch of the Just Essentials opening price point range in 2022. Value remains a key priority, including the aim to pass along the benefits of commodity price deflation where it has occurred and reflecting significant investment in our key supplier relationships. Nevertheless, sales performance in 2023 continues to reflect the pass through of the significant commodity price inflation which has occurred over the past two years. The Group has continued to invest in driving quality improvement across our own-brand mid-tier offering. Following refreshes to the Group’s produce, meat fish and poultry, and bakery in 2021 and 2022, the Group has overhauled its core chilled, meal solutions, and cooking ingredients ranges in 2023. These categories are key signifiers of quality and are central to the Group’s strategic priority to make desirable products affordable, giving customers a reason to reappraise Asda’s offering. The Group has also launched a selection of premium sub-brands, including two vegan-friendly ranges, Plant Based, a healthy, balanced selection of meat-free lines, and OMV!, an indulgent vegan range, as well as ranges to rival takeaway offerings and key competitor prepared food ranges. These include, our popular Bistro, Take Out and House of Yum ranges. The Group also launched some ambitious quality and taste match campaigns during the year, including an M&S quality match across a range of popular items. 127 ----- _Non-food_ Non-food sales grew slightly in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to year ended December 31, 2022 on a like-for-like basis and were particularly strong in the first half of 2023, in both clothing and general merchandise. Across both clothing and general merchandise, the third quarter was particularly impacted by the unseasonal weather, but rebounded to like for like growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. _Online_ Online sales comprise Asda.com grocery sales and non-food sales through George.com. Online grocery is a key strength of the Group, where it held the number two grocery market share position throughout 2023, and online is a key element of Asda’s omnichannel retail offering, fostering strong customer loyalty and typically larger spend per basket. The proportion of sales made through online delivery and click and collect was slightly higher in 2023. _Fuel_ Fuel sales were £3,719 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, a decrease of 7.6% as compared to £4,026 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. A decrease in the Asda legacy business’ fuel sales was predominantly due to the lower average selling price of fuel in 2023 compared to 2022, which saw record and volatile commodity prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. This was partly offset by the additional fuel sales from the acquired businesses. _Foodservice_ The Group acquired 419 food service outlets in the EG UK Business, comprising franchises of brands including Greggs, Subway and Burger King, as well as one proprietary brand Leon. Food service sales of £40 million were recorded in 2023 following the completion of the EG UK Acquisition. We believe that the addition of foodservice to Asda’s portfolio is a strong strategic fit and complements our omni-channel retail offering, with further opportunity for growth and synergies within the store estate. _Other income_ Other income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £70.9 million, an increase of £1.1 million, or 1.6%, compared to £69.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily a result of slightly increased rental income for the year ended December 31, 2022. _Operating costs_ Operating costs post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2023 were £25,119.2 million, an increase of £430.9 million, or 1.7%, compared to £24,688.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was primarily a result of increases in the cost of goods sold as a result of higher sales, year-on-year increases in inventory losses, investments in colleague pay and a year-on-year increase in Project Future costs, as well as additional transaction costs relating to the EG UK Acquisition in the year ended December 31, 2023. _Finance income_ Finance income post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £52.5 million, a decrease of £2.9 million, or 5.2%, compared to £55.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a £23.0 million decrease in interest receivable from a fellow subsidiary of the ultimate parent, after an exercise to settle intercompany loan receivables and payables was carried out in September 2022. This decrease was partially offset by a £20.6 million increase in bank interest receivable, driven by an increase in interest rates on short-term deposits, and higher average cash balances. This included the impact of £646 million of net proceeds in respect of the Sale and Leaseback Transaction, the majority of which was received approximately 11 weeks in advance of the completion of the EG UK Acquisition. 128 ----- _Finance costs_ Finance costs post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2023 were £440.8 million, an increase of £45.3 million, or 11.5%, compared to £395.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher costs on external borrowings, including 10 months’ worth of interest charged on the £200 million facility used in connection with the Arthur Acquisition at a rate of SONIA + 7.75bps, which was repaid in October 2023, compared to two months’ charged in the 2022; two months’ worth of interest on the Private Placement Facility at a rate of SONIA + 6.75bps entered into to fund the EG UK Acquisition; and two months’ worth of interest on the America Bridge Loan at a rate of SONIA + 7.00bps entered into to fund the EG UK Acquisition. The America Bridge Loan was repaid in December 2023 upon completion of the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction. Interest on lease liabilities also increased to £177 million in the year ended December 31, 2023 as compared to £146 million in the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to the interest on leases which were entered into as a result of the Sale and Leaseback Transaction. These increases were partly offset by a reduction in intercompany interest payable to a fellow subsidiary of the ultimate parent following the intercompany loan settlement exercise in September 2022 referred to under finance income above. _Reimbursement income_ Reimbursement income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was nil, compared to £49.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This decrease was primarily due to a reimbursed settlement relating to historical tax reliefs in the year ended December 31, 2022. _Income tax credit/(expense)_ Income tax credit post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2023 was £14.2 million, a decrease of £63.4 million, or 81.7%, compared to a tax credit of £77.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This was due to increased amounts of deferred taxation in the year ended December 31, 2022. _Cash flow forward contracts reclassification during the period to income statement_ Cash flow forward contracts reclassification during the period to income statement for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to a gain reclassified to the income statement of £15.3 million, a change of £38.7 million compared to a loss reclassified to the income statement of £23.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This change was due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars and the settling of those forward contracts that occurred in the relevant period. The gain reclassified to the income statement in the year ended December 31, 2023 is a result of the GBP weakening versus the USD over the average forward contract life, whereas the loss reclassified to the income statement in the year ended December 31, 2022 is a result of the GBP strengthening versus the USD over the average forward contract life. _Cash flow forward contracts net gain/(loss) during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts_ Cash flow forward contracts net loss during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to £36.3. million, a change of £50.7 million compared to a net gain of £14.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This change was primarily due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars in each financial year and the value of those contracts not settled at the end of the year based on the exchange rate at the end of the year. _Tax on cash flow forward contracts recognised directly in other comprehensive income_ Tax on cash flow forward contracts recognised directly in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2023 was a credit of £5.2 million, an increase of £3.7 million compared to a credit of £1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase in this credit was due to net loss on cash flow forward contracts in 2023 compared to 2022 as described above. _Other comprehensive (expense)/income_ Other comprehensive expense for the year ended December 31, 2023 amounted to an expense of £39.5 million, a change of £50.5 million compared to income £11.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2022. This 129 ----- change was primarily due to an increase in items to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result of cash flow hedges as described above.

For the year ended December 31, 2021, it remains as it was presented in the 2021 Financial Statements, which have not been restated. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Certain Restatements _and Reclassifications.”_ Unless otherwise specified, all results presented below for the year ended December 31, 2021 are on an actual basis, rather than annualized to reflect a full twelve months of trading. See “—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of _Operations—The Acquisition Transactions.” Revenue_ Revenue (including fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £24,477.8 million, an increase of £989 million, or 4.2%, compared to £23,489 million on an annualised basis for the year ended December 31, 2021. Actual revenue (including fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was £20,710.4 million. This increase was primarily due to higher fuel prices in the year driven by inflation in oil prices, and higher fuel volume sales following lockdowns in the year ended December 31, 2021 impacting travel. Revenue (excluding fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £20,452 million, an increase of £28 million, or 0.1%, compared to £20,424 million on an annualised basis for the year ended December 31, 2021. Actual revenue (excluding fuel) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was £17,900 million. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 was broadly in line with the prior year. Performance in the first half of 2022 was challenging. In the context of growing inflation and cost of living pressures and exceptional sales in 2021 during COVID-19 lockdowns, we experienced a decline in like-for-like sales and some loss of market share. Performance recovered in the second half of the year and showed strong growth, driven by new initiatives to drive strategic objectives, including launching Dropped and Locked prices, Just Essentials and Asda Rewards. Market share recovered in the second half of the year and the total number of customer transactions increased. Further commentary below provides detail on the performance of our key categories. _Food_ In the first six months of the year ended December 31, 2022 we experienced like-for-like decline in sales due to the tailwind from COVID-19 related lockdowns in 2021 which led to an increase in at-home grocery consumption. The lockdown was in place for the majority of the first quarter of 2021, with some restrictions continuing into the 130 ----- second quarter of 2021 and beyond. We also experienced loss of market share over the first six months of the year ended December 31, 2022 which further contributed to like-for-like sales declines. From the second quarter of 2022 onwards, we experienced an improvement in sales momentum and recorded positive like-for-like results for the second half of the year. Food sales were boosted following the launch of Asda’s Dropped and Locked price campaign, which locked prices for customers in light of cost-of-living pressures. The campaign saw prices of a wide selection of family favourite products dropped and locked until the end of the year to give customers certainty around their shopping. In May 2022, Asda launched its new opening price point own brand range, Just Essentials by Asda. The range replaced Asda Smart Price, with new branding and products reformulated for taste and quality, doubling the number of items in the range and providing all the products customers need to keep the household running on a budget. Throughout the year ended December 31, 2022, we also continued our investment in mid-tier own-brand ranges. Following on from refreshing the produce range in the year ended December 31, 2021, we overhauled our bakery and meat, fish and poultry categories including expanding the range of products, improving the quality and refreshing the packaging. These categories are key signifiers of quality and are central to our strategic priority to make desirable products affordable, giving customers a reason to reappraise our offering and contributing to strong like-for-like sales growth in food in the last six months of year ended December 31, 2022. In August 2022, we rolled out our new loyalty programme Asda Rewards nationwide, following successful trials in a number of stores since the start of the year. Asda Rewards provides customers with Asda pounds, not points, for their loyalty through an app-based scheme. Customers earn cash back on their shopping, with regularly updated missions and star products enabling extra savings. _Non-food_ In non-food sales, performance in the second quarter of 2022 was similarly lower than the comparative period in 2021 when we benefited from non-essential retail stores being closed during COVID-19 lockdowns. Sales in both clothing and general merchandise were also impacted by supply chain challenges from the fourth quarter of 2021 which led to the wrong stock being in place in the early part of the year. Direction provided by new leadership contributed to significant improvement in sales momentum in the second quarter of 2022, in particular following the Queen Elizabeth’s Jubilee Weekend, when our proposition appealed strongly to customers and we delivered new relevant product. In the third quarter of 2022, clothing grew ahead of the market, with particular strengths in women’s wear and back to school sales, supported by improvements in merchandising and in-store shopping experience following reopening fitting rooms after COVID-19-related closures. In the fourth quarter of 2022, clothing sales were impacted by availability challenges resulting which arose during a major system upgrade. Some issues with the transfer to the new system led to challenges in visibility and allocating stock, preventing product from being distributed around the store network appropriately; however, sales recovered in December 2022 following resolution of these issues and have since continued in positive growth in line with expectations. In General Merchandise, the George Home range delivered strong performance in the second half of the year ended December 31, 2022, offering an affordable and stylish proposition to customers. Highlights included summer outdoor and seasonal ranges, with particular growth in energy-saving and winter products to support customers through the cost of living and energy crisis in the fourth quarter of 2022. _Online_ We have a strong market position in grocery home shopping, with around 16% of our food sales coming through online channels in the year ended December 31, 2022 (including home delivery and click and collect services). Online continues to be a key part of our omni-channel strategy to enable customers to shop wherever and however they choose. Online sales stabilised in the year ended December 31, 2022 following considerable growth in the channel during the COVID-19 pandemic; total online sales for the full year were slightly lower than the prior year and lower as a proportion of total sales, as more customers returned to shopping instore. We continue to invest in ways to optimise the online experience for customers, focusing on availability, range and service. 131 ----- _Other income_ Other income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £69.8 million, a decrease of £2,863.6 million, compared to £2,933.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to the gain on bargain purchase of the Asda Group Limited by the Senior Notes Issuer of £2,654 million, and the gain on sale and leaseback of the warehouse assets of £279 million in the year ended December 31, 2021, which was not repeated in the year ended December 31, 2022. In the year ended December 31, 2022 other income was primarily related to rental income and concession and commission income. _Operating costs_ Operating costs post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2022 were £24,688.3 million, an increase of £4,425.8 million, or 21.8%, compared to £20,262.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to significant increase in inflation across our cost base, partially offset to a certain extent by cost saving initiatives such as bringing cleaning in-house from a third-party supplier, delivering operating efficiencies in our stores and depots and reduction in COVID-19-related costs. There has been a significant increase in supply side inflation in the year ended December 31, 2022, in particular following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Labour shortages, investment in colleague wages, increases in energy and fuel cost inflation have driven higher cost prices in our supply base and in our own cost base. In our non-food business, margins were also impacted by significant increases in freight, detention and demurrage costs as the global economy emerged from the pandemic, exacerbated by further lockdowns in China, and adverse movements in foreign exchange rates following the UK mini-budget in September 2022. In the selling, general and administrative cost base, we also saw notable cost increases which impacted profitability. These cost increases included energy costs for operating our stores, depots and offices and fuel costs in running our logistics and online operations. We also incurred additional exceptional costs in the year ended December 31, 2022 relating to our investment in Project Future, and transaction costs incurred in connection with the LBO Acquisition. _Finance income_ Finance income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £55.4 million, an increase of £26.0 million, or 88%, compared to £29.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to approximately ten months’ interest being earned on the intercompany receivable balance which arose out of the 2021 Sale and Leaseback Transactions, compared to approximately six months’ interest in the year ended December 31, 2021. _Finance costs_ Finance costs post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2022 were £395.5 million, an increase of £20.4 million, or 5%, compared to £375.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase of £40 million in interest payable on lease liabilities reflecting a full year of interest being recorded in relation to the 2021 Sale and Leaseback Transactions which was largely completed in June 2021. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of £11 million in external interest payable driven primarily by settlement of the Forecourt Bridge Facility in November 2021 and a reduction of £8 million in intercompany interest payable driven by settlement of an amount owing to our immediate parent company during the year ended December 31, 2022. _Reimbursement income_ Reimbursement income post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2022 was £49.3 million compared to nil in the year ended December 31, 2021. In the year ended December 31, 2022 reimbursement income was primarily related to a reimbursed settlement relating to historical tax reliefs. _Income tax credit/(expense)_ Income tax post-underlying items for the year ended December 31, 2022 was a credit of £77.6 million, from an expense of £245.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to a prior period deferred tax charge of £281 million arising from an increase in the headline corporation tax rate which was 132 ----- substantively enacted in May 2021. This change was partially offset by a one-off net credit in 2021 of £74 million relating to the 2021 Sale and Leaseback Transactions. _Cash flow forward contracts reclassification during the period to income statement_ Cash flow forward contracts reclassification during the year to income statement for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to a loss of £23.4 million, a change of £65.7 million compared to a gain of £42.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This change was due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars and the settling of those forward contracts that occurred in the relevant period: losses were caused by the GBP strengthening versus the USD over the year of forward contracts, resulting in the contracts being “out of the money.” The loss in the year ended December 31, 2022 is a result of the GBP strengthening versus the USD over the average forward contract life, whereas the gain in the year ended December 31, 2021 is a result of the pounds sterling weakening versus the USD over the average forward contract life. _Cash flow forward contracts net (loss)/gain during the year of the not-yet-matured contracts_ Cash flow forward contracts net gain during the year of the not-yet-matured contracts for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to £11.6 million, a change of £2.8 million compared to a net gain of £14.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to fluctuations in the USD/ pounds sterling exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars in each financial year and the value of those contracts not settled at the end of the year based on the exchange rate at the end of the year. _Tax on cash flow forward contracts recognised directly in other comprehensive income_ Tax on cash flow forward contracts recognised directly in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2022 was an expense of £10.2 million, a change of £11.7 million compared to a credit of £1.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This change was primarily due to the reduction of the net gain on cash flow hedges in 2022 compared to 2021 as described above. _Other comprehensive (expense)/income_ Other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2022 amounted to £11.0 million, a change of £30.1 million compared to an income of £41.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2021. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in items to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result in cash flow hedges as described above and our forward contracts.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.39,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.39.1,,"Our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is expected to be our operating cash flows and borrowings under our New Revolving Facility. Our cash-generative business, due to the nature of the grocery industry, together with our relatively low capital expenditure, has driven cash flow generation, including comparatively high unlevered free cash flow. Our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which, in turn, depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. See “Risk _Factors.” We are a structurally negative working capital business driven by growth in payables, and the beneficial_ payment terms to suppliers versus payments received by consumers instantly on purchase. In 2023, we increased our focus on cash management, particularly related to working capital. We delivered a very strong net working capital performance in 2022 and 2023, with our active working capital management resulting in increased working capital inflows in those two years. These improvements in net working capital were driven partly through key supplier partner negotiations related to the deferral of cash payables. Stock was also more tightly managed and we began to see a more favourable trajectory for fuel price and volume. Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings under our New Revolving Facility, will be adequate to meet our anticipated working capital and general corporate needs for the next 12 months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities 133 ----- or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 included a net working capital inflow of £223 million. This inflow was driven principally by an increase in trade and other payables of £281 million due to working capital improvement initiatives and payment timing benefits relating to weekly supplier payments and payroll. The increase was partially offset by an increase in trade and other receivables of £32 million due to an increase in supplier income and in inventory of £13 million driven by investment to improve availability, partially offset by prior year inventory build in non-food which followed a new system implementation in our George brand in 2022. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by £254.80 million, to £1,176.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from £922.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due to an increase in trade and other payables of £408 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, due to strong like-for-like sales growth in the fourth quarter, improvements in supplier payment terms and favourable timing impacts of supplier payment runs relative to the year-end date. The increase was partly offset by an increase in inventory of £109 million, driven in part by inflationary cost increases, as well as a proactive decision to build the inventory position to protect availability. _Cash flows (used in)/ from in investing activities_ Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 increased by £1,285.1 million, or 163.0%, to £2,073.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from £788.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase included the £2,000 million consideration paid for the EG UK Acquisition in 2023, as well as the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles of £337 million. This increase was partially offset by a proportion of the proceeds from the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transaction of £136 million and cash acquired on consolidation of the EG UK Business and the Arthur Business of £31 million and £36 million, respectively Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by £5,513.5 million, or 87.5%, to an outflow of £788.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from an outflow of £6,302.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This increase was primarily due the cash consideration paid for the LBO Acquisition in the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the cash flows used in investing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022, which were comprised primarily of purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangibles of £320 million (see “—Capital Expenditure”) and a cash outflow related to the Arthur Acquisition of £424 million (of which £200 million was funded through debt and the remainder from cash on balance sheet, net of £5 million bank fees). 134 ----- _Cash flows from/(used in) financing activities_ Cash flows from financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2023 changed by £1,424.3 million, to an inflow of £1,193.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2023 from an outflow of £231.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The change was primarily due to the proceeds from the draw down of external debt (net of fees) of £1,304 million in 2023, a proportion of the proceeds from the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions of £509 million and an increase in intercompany payables of £401 million, partially offset by the repayment of external debt of £500 million (including the America Bridge Loan), £188 million of interest payments on external debt and capital and interest payments of £324 million in respect of leases. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 decreased by £6,116.80 million from an inflow of £5,885.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 to an outflow of £231.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. This increase was primarily driven by proceeds from a drawdown of £4,920.6 million of external debt in the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the LBO Acquisition, compared to net cash outflows used in financing activities in the year ended December 31, 2022, which were primarily comprised of £(231) million from the drawdown on a corporate facility of £200 million to finance the Arthur Acquisition (net of £5 million bank fees), £150 million of interest payments on external debt and capital and interest payments of £277 million in respect of leases.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Capital expenditure has on average amounted to 1.5% of sales (including fuel) between the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2023. Capital expenditure as disclosed in the consolidated statement of cash flows is the sum of the purchase of property, plant and equipment and purchase of intangible assets. We also use Capital Expenditure KPI as a key performance indicator, which is defined as the total costs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of which the Group takes ownership within a financial period (as opposed to the UK IFRS measurement of capital expenditure which is based on cash flows). It excludes capital expenditure on Project Future, our investment to separate from Walmart’s IT systems, since it is one-off and non-recurring in nature.

Cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US dollars and euro. Some purchases in US dollars are managed using forward contracts. The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at December 31, 2023, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of future purchases. The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a period of more than 18 months after December 31, 2023. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and at December 31, 2023, a net unrealised loss of £12.2 million (as compared to a net unrealised gain of £36.2 million at December 31, 2022 and a net unrealised gain of £43.7 million at December 31, 2021) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of hedging contracts. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year ended December 31, 2023 in respect of these hedging contracts was £15.8 million (as compared to a net loss of £7.5 million at December 31, 2022 and a net gain of £43.7 million at December 31, 2021) and a gain of £32.6 million was reclassified to retained earnings during the year ended December 31, 2023. This consists of a £36.3 million loss on not-yet-matured contracts during the year (as compared to a gain of £14.4 million at December 31, 2022 and a net gain of £11.6 million at December 31, 2021), £15.3 million of losses reclassified to the income statement during the year (as compared to £23.4 million of gains at December 31, 2022 and £42.3 million of losses at December 31, 2021) and a £5.2 million taxation credit (as compared to a £1.5 million taxation credit as at December 31, 2022 and a £10.2 million charge as at December 31, 2021). Under the Group’s hedging policy, forward currency contracts can be used for both goods for resale and goods not for resale. The only items for which forward currency contracts are in place as at December 31, 2023 are forecast purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 100% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the income statement at the point of sale. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash flows would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 (which was also the case during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022), therefore amounts recognised in the income statement in relation to ineffective forward contract hedges were £nil (which was also the case during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022). At December 31, 2023, the Group held £1,234.4 million of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts, designated as cash flow hedges (as compared to £749.5 million as at December 31, 2022 and £699.9 million as at December 31, 2021). These forward contracts are largely in relation to purchases of US dollars (notional $1,470.0 million) and euros (notional €71.4 million) with varying maturities up to June 2025. For the above currencies the rates ranged from USD/GBP from 1.210 to 1.302 (as compared to 1.098 to 1.369 in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 1.315 to 1.420 in the year ended December 31, 2021) and euro/GBP 1.142 to 1.164 (as compared to 1.132 to 1.157 in the year ended December 31, 2022 and 1.165 to 1.189 in the year ended December 31, 2021). As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure using forward currency contracts, changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short-term profitability or cash flow. It is anticipated that a 5% movement in the US Dollar/pounds sterling exchange rate, which represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of £47.2 million at December 31, 2023 (as compared to a movement of £34.6 million in December 31, 2022 and a movement of £33.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2021). 140 ----- See note 21 (“Financial Instruments”) of the 2023 Financial Statements for further information on foreign currency risk. _Cross-currency swap_ The Group has entered into Facility B (EUR) which is a floating rate euro denominated term loan facility. The non-pounds sterling interest and principal repayment cash flows from the euro debt agreement expose the Group to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that impact the consolidated basis. Under the Group’s hedging policy, the Group hedges both the foreign exchange and interest rate risk associated with a portion of the Group’s existing euro foreign-currency denominated debt using EUR-GBP cross currency interest rate swap contracts to effectively eliminate variability in the Group’s functional currency equivalent cash flows due to variability in the EUR-GBP exchange rate and the variable interest rate. The hedge ratio is 100% on a current notional basis. The Group has excluded from the cross-currency interest rate swap both the time value and currency basis elements of the cross-currency interest rate swap. Ineffectiveness could arise from movements in counterparty credit spread, the non-zero fair value at the hedge designation date due to market changes that have occurred since the instrument’s inception and changes to critical terms (such as reset dates, index mismatches or payment dates). To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the change in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. The amounts recognised in the income statement for the year ended December 31, 2023 relating to ineffectiveness and excluded items was less than £0.3 million (as compared to less than £0.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2022). At December 31, 2023, the Group holds cross-currency interest rate swaps (“CCIRS”) with a total nominal value of €844.5 million, designated as cash flow hedges. These swaps result in a fixed pounds sterling interest rate ranging from 3.70% to 3.76% and EUR/GBP rate of 1.1412. On February 16, 2024, following the expiration of the CCIRSs in place as at December 31, 2023, the Group entered into new CCIRSs with an expiration date of February 16, 2025 with the same counterparty banks. This eliminates variability in the Group’s functional currency equivalent cash flows in relation to Original Facility B (EUR) for the Group for the 12-month period to February 16, 2025 and fixes the interest rate on Original Facility B (EUR) at fixed GBP interest rates of between 8.03% and 8.06%. The Group is also currently contemplating additional cross-currency swaps as well as interest rate swaps in respect of the unhedged portion of its ongoing EUR exposure and floating rate exposure respectively under the Senior Facilities Agreement. See “Risk Factors— Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure and the Senior Secured Notes—Currency exchange rates _may have an impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.”_ The CCIRSs were assessed to be highly effective and as at December 31, 2023, a net unrealised gain of £3.1 million (as compared to £21.2 million at December 31, 2022 and £6.6 million at December 31, 2021) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net loss recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve during 2023 in respect of these swaps was £18.1 million (as compared to a gain £14.5 million at December 31, 2022 and a gain of £7.3 million at December 31, 2021). This consists of a £2.5 million gain reclassified to the income statement during 2023 (as compared to £35.5 million gain at December 31, 2022 and £34.6 million loss at December 31, 2021), by a £21.8 million loss (as compared to a £54.9 million gain at December 31, 2022 and £25.5 million loss at December 31, 2021) on the fair value of the swaps at period end and a taxation credit of £6.3 million (as compared to £4.8 million at December 31, 2022 and £2.4 million at December 31, 2021). The value of the CCIRSs is sensitive to movements in EURIBOR and EUR/GBP exchange rates. A 0.5% change in EURIBOR would result in a £2.8 million change in value of the CCIRSs (as compared to £2.9 million at December 31, 2022 and £6.5 million at December 31, 2021) and a 5% change in the EUR/GBP exchange rates would result in a £47.2 million change in the value of the CCIRSs (as compared to £38.9 million at December 31, 2022 and £38.1 million at December 31, 2021). The amounts charged to the income statement are not sensitive to a change in interest rates but a 5% increase in the FX rate would increase the amount of ineffectiveness by £nil (as compared to £nil at December 31, 2022 and £0.4 million at December 31, 2021). Following the Transactions, we plan to re-evaluate the implementation of foreign exchange and interest rate hedging contracts in line with our historical approach. 141 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

During 2023, the Group was exposed to interest rate risk on a bridge facility entered into to partially fund the Arthur Acquisition (the “Arthur Additional Bridge Facility”), this was settled in full on October 23, 2023. The EURIBOR interest rate risk on Original Facility B is hedged through entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps to fix the interest payments in pound sterling at rates between 3.70% and 3.76% which expired on February 16, 2024. The SONIA interest rate risk on the Private Placement Facility entered into during 2023 is hedged through entering into interest rate swaps to fix a proportion of the interest payments at a fixed interest rate between 4.75% and 4.78% which expires on November 16, 2025. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes is charged at fixed rates between 3.25% and 4.50%. The Existing Senior Secured Notes are set at fixed rates of 3.25% and 4.50%. The Existing Senior Notes are set at a fixed rate of 4.00%. The Senior Secured Notes will also be a fixed rate instrument. 138 ----- The Group, after the impact of hedge accounting, is exposed to possible changes in SONIA on its outstanding floating rate loans. In the year ended December 31, 2023, it is anticipated that a 0.5% increase in the SONIA rate would give rise to a decrease in profit before tax of £1.8 million (as compared to £1.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 and £0.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2021). The Group’s Original Facility A, and Original Revolving Facility have been impacted by the interest rate benchmark reform in 2022. The Group transitioned these agreements to the new UK risk-free rate benchmark, SONIA, which was applied to the Group’s interest period starting April 1, 2022 and which will also apply to New Facility A and the New Revolving Facility. See note 21 (“Financial Instruments”) of the 2023 Financial Statements for further information on interest rate risk. _Interest rate swaps_ The Group has entered into the Private Placement Facility with interest rates calculated based on SONIA. The variable interest rate exposes the Group to interest rate fluctuations that impact the profit or loss on a consolidated basis. At December 31, 2023, the Group holds interest rate swaps (“IRS”) with a total nominal value of £540.0 million, designated as cash flow hedges. The hedge ratio is on a 79% current notional basis. These IRS result in a fixed GBP interest rate ranging from 11.50% to 11.53%. The IRS were assessed to be highly effective and as at December 31, 2023, a net unrealised loss of £4.8 million was included in the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of these swaps was £4.8 million. This consists of a £0.4 million gain reclassified to the income statement during the year and a £6.0 million loss on the fair value of the swaps at year end and a taxation credit of £1.6 million. The value of the IRS is sensitive to movements in SONIA. A 0.5% change in SONIA results in a £10.9 million change in value of the IRS. Following the Transactions, we plan to re-evaluate the implementation of foreign exchange and interest rate hedging contracts in line with our historical approach.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

According to Euromonitor, grocery retail – referring to the sum of hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, warehouse clubs, small local grocers and food/drink/tobacco specialists – is the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom. It represented £200.6 billion of Retail Value RSP (comprising approximately 44% of total retail sales) in 2023, compared to £190.7 billion of Retail Value RSP (comprising approximately 43% of total retail sales) in 2022. In the past fourteen years, grocery retail in the United Kingdom only experienced negative year-on-year growth in 2015 (negative 0.2%) and 2016 (negative 4.6%), in spite of macroeconomic, uncertainties and periods of food deflation measured by the consumer price index (“CPI”), according to the OECD. We operate in the retail market, offering a wide range of both food and non-food products and services from our supercentres, superstores, supermarkets, convenience and Asda Living stores, as well as through various online platforms. The origins of our business are in the UK grocery retail market and, while our business has grown and diversified into other markets including clothing retail and general merchandise retail, we remain focused on offering high-quality, value-based grocery retail options to our customers.

Sales Tax, GBP, Current terms. Note: The UK grocery retail market refers to the sum of channels, including hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, warehouse clubs, small local grocers as well as food/drink/tobacco specialists.)_ Grocery retail sales in the United Kingdom are made via multiple channels, including hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retailers and online. We currently operate in the hypermarket, supermarket, convenience, forecourt and online channels. Hypermarkets are larger-format retail stores, frequently located on out-of-town sites or as anchor stores in a shopping centre, with a primary focus on selling food, beverages, tobacco and other groceries while offering a wide variety of non-grocery products, such as general merchandise and clothing. Supermarkets are smaller-scale retail stores that offer a wide variety of food, beverages and household products. Hypermarket formats are offered by the traditional grocers, while supermarket stores are offered by stores such as the Co-op, Waitrose and M&S, in addition to the traditional grocers. Based on Euromonitor data, the sum of hypermarket and supermarket channels constitute the largest share by Retail Value RSP of the UK grocery retail market, representing 54.1% of grocery Retail Value RSP in 2023. However, in the last five calendar years, growth for the sum of these two channels has slowed, with a combined CAGR of 2.3% between 2018 and 2023, according to Euromonitor. In contrast, over the past 15 years convenience stores such as Tesco Express, Sainsbury’s Local, Co-op On the Go, Little Waitrose and M&S Simply Food, have gained popularity. In 2023, they represented 19.0% of Retail Value RSP and are the second-largest channel in the grocery retail market, according to Euromonitor. The forecourt channel represented 3.0% of the total grocery retail market on a Retail Value RSP basis in 2023 and grew at a CAGR of 2.3% between 2016 and 2023, according to Euromonitor. This was driven by recent initiatives from forecourt operators to improve the food product quality and the foodservice offering. Forecourts also usually have longer opening hours compared to hypermarkets and supermarkets and are often in close proximity to end consumers. Based on Euromonitor, convenience retailers grew at a CAGR of 3.4% between 2015 and 2023. Excluding convenience retailers, the UK grocery retail market grew at a 2.5% CAGR between 2015 and 2023. The 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the resulting weakened customer sentiment thereafter helped discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and Lidl) to gain a strong foothold in the UK grocery retail market. Between 147 ----- 2007 and 2015, discounters gained considerable scale and market share due to new store openings and increased footfall resulting primarily from product offerings targeted at increasingly price-conscious customers. According to Euromonitor, the discounters channel represented 14.0% of the total grocery retail market on a Retail Value RSP basis in 2023. For more information, see “—UK Grocery Retail _Key Trends.” Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK grocery retail market has seen an increasing shift away from physical stores to online purchasing, with online grocery sales having grown significantly faster than those of physical stores in recent years. According to Euromonitor, in 2023, the online channel (food & drink e-commerce) comprised 13.8% of the UK grocery retail market. The online channel, which has also reported strong Retail Value RSP growth historically, with a CAGR of 20.3% between 2018 and 2023, is driven by shoppers’ growing appetite for convenience and digital connectivity, as well as by service enhancements in online operations. Following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, this growth has been bolstered as customers increasingly turn to online groceries in order to maintain social distance, a trend which may result in a sustained change in preferences going forward. On the basis of Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, we are the third-largest player in the UK grocery retail market (with a 13.7% market share), according to Kantar Worldpanel. Other key players are Tesco (with a 27.3% market share), Sainsbury’s (with a 15.1% market share) and Aldi (with a 9.8% market share), in each case on the basis of Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Together, the traditional grocers of Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons comprise 64.9% of the total market on the basis of Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel. Other grocery retailers include Aldi, Co-op, Lidl and Waitrose. Waitrose operates at the premium end of the market and commands a lower share of the market at 4.5%, while the discounters Aldi and Lidl hold market shares of 9.8% and 7.6%, respectively, in each case according to Kantar Worldpanel and on the basis of Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024.

Note: The UK grocery retail market refers to the sum of channels, including hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, warehouse clubs, small local grocers as well as food/drink/tobacco specialists.)_ In 2023, grocery retail was the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom and was valued at £200.5 billion on a Retail Value RSP basis, according to Euromonitor. Between 2009 and 2016, the UK grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 2.2%. Between 2016 and 2023, the market grew at a CAGR of 3.1%. During the COVID-19 pandemic between 2019 and 2020, it grew at a CAGR of 4.6%. Generally, we believe that sales in the UK grocery retail market have demonstrated resilience and stability through economic cycles. According to the ONS, inflation, as measured by the consumer price index, rose by 4.2% in the United Kingdom in the twelve months ended January 2024 (down from 8.8% in the twelve months ended January 2023), driven by, among others, higher food costs and freight costs. Additionally, the reduction in lower-paid jobs compared to prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, led to a rise in average pay growth rates, which we believe will benefit the UK grocery retail market environment, as higher wage rates can be supportive of spending trends, some of which may trickle into grocery retail. According to the ONS, the United Kingdom’s real gross domestic product (“GDP”) amounted to £2.0 trillion in 2023. The following chart sets forth the historical and projected year-on-year real GDP growth in the United Kingdom for the period from 2007 to 2023. According to Fitch Solutions, although the United Kingdom’s GDP declined by 10.4% in 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, GDP has rebounded in 2021 and returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2022, with an average expected real GDP growth CAGR of approximately 0.4% from 2023 to 2025. _(Sources: Fitch Solutions.)_ 144 ----- According to the ONS, as set forth in the following chart, the United Kingdom’s population reached 67.0 million in 2021 and is expected to grow at an approximate CAGR of 0.7% between 2021 and 2031. _(Source: ONS.)_ In 2022, UK households spent, on average, £62.20 per week on food and non-alcoholic drinks, comprising 11.8% of average weekly household expenditure according to the ONS. Between 2007 and 2022, the percentage of average household expenditure spent on food and non-alcoholic drinks ranged from 10.5% to 14.4%, as shown in the following chart. _(Source: ONS.)_ Furthermore, the split between at-home and out-of-home (“OOH”) food and drink consumption in the United Kingdom has remained relatively stable in recent years, with the exception of 2020 – 2021 given the COVID-19 pandemic. This change has yet to be reversed, with OOH consumption remaining around 1,000 basis points lower than pre-COVID-19 levels. _(Sources: ONS.)_ 145 ----- Moreover, as shown in the following chart, the UK grocery retail market has shown positive year-on-year market growth for 12 out of the past 14 years. This growth is reflective of the relatively essential nature of grocery purchases, which represent a necessary and regular household expenditure as compared to more discretionary spending categories, such as clothing, footwear and electronics. According to Euromonitor, the UK grocery retail market experienced solid growth of 5.2% between 2022 and 2023. _(Source: Euromonitor: Retail 2024 Edition; Retail Value RSP excl.

Customer preference has shifted away from larger, out-of-town formats towards smaller, proximity formats, with customers prioritising convenience and shopping habits shifting towards smaller basket sizes coupled with increased frequency of purchases. The industry has also seen the rapid growth of discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and Lidl) that compete through differentiation on price coupled with a more limited selection of own-brand products. According to Kantar Worldpanel, COVID-19 has accelerated the shifts towards online purchasing since lockdown measures were first introduced in the United Kingdom in March 2020, however, online channel growth started to slow down significantly and is now normalised since the reopening post COVID-19 period.

According to Euromonitor, the UK clothing and footwear retail market was valued at £45.9 billion on a Retail Value RSP basis in 2023. During the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the UK clothing and footwear retail market declined as a result of rising unemployment, pressure on discretionary spending and weakened customer confidence. Furthermore, the market experienced a period of price inflation between 2010 and 2012. Between 2014 and 2019, the UK clothing and footwear retail market grew at a CAGR of 2.7%, with much of the growth driven by online channels, which had a CAGR of 11.3% between 2014 and 2019 in comparison to a CAGR of only 0.1% for in-store channels, 150 ----- each on a Retail Value RSP basis, as stated by Euromonitor. These results reflect an overall trend toward increased access to, and usage of, the internet coupled with a greater propensity to buy online and growing usage of social media to influence and facilitate clothing and footwear retail sales. The UK clothing and footwear retail market experienced a significant downturn in 2020 due to COVID-19 related lockdowns and reduced consumer demand for non-essential purchases which included clothing and footwear with the overall market down -20.0% in 2020, according to Euromonitor. During the first of such lockdowns which lasted from March 23, 2020 to July 4, 2020, all non-essential retail stores including all clothing and footwear stores were ordered to close by the UK government. Subsequently, the value of retail sales of clothing and footwear at current prices (seasonally adjusted) decreased by 12.0% in the first quarter of 2020 and 53.9% in the second quarter of 2020 respectively as compared to the same period a year earlier, according to ONS. In-store sales began to recover in the third quarter of 2020 as lockdowns were eased. The third quarter and fourth quarter of 2020 saw a gradual recovery with a 17.3% and 20.6% decrease respectively in the value of retail sales of clothing and footwear at current prices (seasonally adjusted) compared to the same period a year earlier, according to ONS. As a result of COVID-19 related lockdowns, the UK clothing and footwear retail market also experienced a significant shift from in-store purchasing to online channels, which saw a 22.3% year-on-year growth according to Euromonitor. In the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK clothing and footwear retail market recovered beyond pre-pandemic levels by 2022, with a market value of £43.6 billion, according to Euromonitor. The return of office working and in-person social events increased the need to purchase more formal clothing and footwear, while the easing of COVID-19 restrictions has fuelled footfall recovery. This was further supported by pent-up demand and local consumers missing the in-person shopping experience. Altogether, the in-store channel has benefitted from a 6.9% year-on-year growth and is valued at £28.8 billion in 2023, according to Euromonitor. While a smaller segment of customers have either remained in a remote work environment or visited stores less often, as online shopping consumer behaviour became the norm in a post-pandemic environment, sales for retail e-commerce fell in 2022. Although habit persistence among some consumers ensured that overall sales levels for the latter remained significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels.

Similar to the UK clothing and footwear market, the UK home products market also experienced a significant downturn in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-19 related lockdowns and reduced consumer demand for non-essential purchases. However, the increased time spent by consumers at home due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United Kingdom has led to higher demand for home office equipment and home improvement activities.

By 2021, the UK home products retail market made a full recovery beyond pre-pandemic levels, increasing to a market value of £26.8 billion. As a result of COVID-19 travel restrictions, local consumers had additional discretionary income, and due to prolonged time at home, there was a continued desire to upgrade their living environments. In the post COVID-19 environment, the value of online purchases remained elevated compared to pre-pandemic levels at £6.8 billion by 2023, signifying a habit persistence in consumer spending towards increased utilisation of the online channel, according to Euromonitor. While the overall market has grown at a CAGR of 2.2% between 2021 and 2023, this was driven by UK consumers having already made significant home products investments in 2020 and 2021, with a reduced incentive to do so in subsequent years.

Between 2014 and 2023, the UK foodservice market experienced a declining 1.6% CAGR, according to Euromonitor. Similar to the UK clothing and footwear market & home products market, the UK foodservice market also experienced a significant downturn in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-19 related lockdowns and reduced consumer demand for out-of-home purchases.

Such customers, however, still desire high-quality offerings. In response, discounters developed a range of value-based propositions focused on delivering high quality at low prices, which appeal to this growing number of UK shoppers who seek a good ‘value.’ These 153 ----- propositions have helped discounters to achieve a strong presence in the UK grocery retail market. For example, discounters Aldi and Lidl have increased their combined market share (on a Till Roll basis) from 4.4% in the calendar year 2010 to 17.5% in the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel and as reflected in the following chart. _(Source: Kantar Worldpanel Take Home Panel, Grocery, 52 w/e January 21[st] 2024, Till Roll.)_ From 2013 to 2023, discounters gained considerable scale and market share as a result of new store openings and continued price consciousness from customers, notably in the post COVID-19 environment, which has been underpinned by higher inflation and a more cash-strapped consumer. According to Euromonitor and relevant public reporting, discounters’ store count grew from 1,118 in 2013 to 1,980 in 2023, as set forth in the following chart. _(Source: Euromonitor: Retail 2024 edition, stores in units.)_ As discounters have increased their store counts, they have won market share from other market players. According to Kantar Worldpanel, for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, we had significant market share in the same geographic areas where discounters already commanded a relatively high market share - the North of England (15.8%), Scotland (13.5%) and Wales (14.1%) - on a Total Grocery Absolute Sales basis, where the discounters also see strong performance. We believe that, as discounters seek to increase their market share through expansion in new areas, they are likely to consider expanding into new regional markets - particularly in London, South of England and East of England - where we have a lower market share, a trend that we believe is supported by the information about 154 ----- market share by geography set forth in the following chart.

Pure online players, such as Ocado and Amazon Fresh, also compete in the UK online grocery market. The strong growth of online grocery sales in the United Kingdom is supported by multiple drivers, including: - Increasing population of tech-aware customers with a higher propensity to buy online; - Higher internet penetration (driven by increased usage of mobile and faster connections) combined with an increasing propensity to use the internet to buy online; - Technological advances significantly improving the online proposition for customers (such as better interfaces, mobile apps, convenient digital wallets and payment systems); - Improving product offerings as technology improves and competition increases (for example, greater availability of products online compared to in-store); and - Improving delivery options as density of deliveries improves (resulting in cheaper, faster deliveries and improved availability of more predictable, flexible and diverse delivery timeslots). Growth in online grocery has been accelerated by the onset of COVID-19 as customers have increasingly prioritised factors such as social distancing and convenience and government restrictions have encouraged customers to find ways to remain at home.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.6,UK Grocery Retail Key Trends,18.6.3,Shift to Convenience,"Another significant customer trend shaping the UK grocery retail market is customers’ increasing prioritisation of convenience. During 2020, the value of convenience store sales experienced a large growth spike of 9.2% as consumers sought and bought their groceries closer to home, driving increased footfall into local convenience and forecourt retail stores. Following the pandemic, convenience sales continued to remain elevated due to inflationary pressures related to growing supply chain costs and rising energy bills, driving prices higher. In addition, convenience store sales in 2022 were boosted by the Jubilee weekend and its festivities, a warmer than usual summer with record temperatures and the FIFA World Cup, boosting sales of products ranging from snacks to cold beverages. Finally, convenience stores also benefitted from the return of pre-pandemic behaviour with footfall levels in city and town centres at higher levels. Growth is expected to normalise in the coming years as a result of the continued cost of living crisis, driving local consumers to become more conscious of their spending, in particular with the rising cost of food products and the growing value proposition of discount retailers. In spite of growth expectations settling down, however, there remains notable tailwinds including the arrival of “frictionless” store formats, which enable the customer to shop for groceries and walk out without passing by the point of sale, and growing partnership with third-party delivery services, which will help drive visibility revenue and reach. Moreover, growth in the convenience retail segment will be supported by an increasing preference amongst customers for more frequent but smaller shopping trips, with numerous top-ups through the course of the week at smaller, more conveniently located stores. This trend can be partly explained by a preference for reduced food waste in light of growing environmental concerns, smaller households, less pre-planned lifestyles and a growing preference in general for convenience.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

This is reflected in the increased usage of self-checkout, “Scan & Go,” “Click & Collect” and online services as customers opt to use these facilities to tailor and improve their shopping experiences. In line with the 156 ----- growing desire for convenience and efficient shopping experiences, there is increasing demand for combined and differentiated service offerings in the grocery retail market, which allow customers to fulfil multiple needs in one convenient location such as parcel collection and drop-off, pharmacy services and selections of household items, all in addition to traditional grocery retail offerings.

There is a growing share of customers who have concerns about animal welfare, environmental sustainability and ethical sourcing, and who view their purchasing decision as a lifestyle statement. In line with these concerns, customers are increasingly demanding traceability and information about production methods, driving the popularity of fair trade and organic products that can meet these needs.

We operate a significant store estate of over 1,200 large stores and convenience sites that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom. We also have the second largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We are also now a major player in the UK convenience market, having added 472 convenience sites (including petrol filling stations) to our portfolio, as well as 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites), following the Arthur Acquisition and EG UK Acquisition. These acquisitions have given us significant foothold in the fast-growing convenience market which, alongside our existing fuel portfolio, makes us the second-largest independent fuel owner-operator in the United Kingdom. The graph below compares our total grocery market share with that of other major UK grocery retailers based on Till Roll data for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel. _(Source: Kantar Worldpanel, Take Home Panel, Grocery, 52 w/e January 21[st] 2024, Till Roll.)_ We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household expenditure on food and beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through economic fluctuations. Groceries are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic, followed only by a slight contraction as the pandemic eased. Since, the UK grocery retail market has experienced consistent growth, achieving a record-high size of £144.0 billion in sales for the 52week period ended December 24, 2023, according to Kantar Worldpanel, despite facing high inflation and global geopolitical tensions in 2022 and 2023. See also “Industry.” One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is in turn centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to offering high quality products with low prices to our customers and our wholly-owned supplier, International Procurement and Logistics Ltd (“IPL”), which enables us to take a vertically-integrated approach to procurement and which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and well-established George Clothing and George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers, our 158 ----- growing presence in the convenience and foodservice market, our popular customer loyalty programme Asda Rewards, and our team of flexible and engaged colleagues. We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenue was £25.6 billion (including fuel), with 16.5% of sales made online, our net cash flow from operating activities was £1,245.8 million, our profit for the year was £194.5 million, and our Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA was £1,264 million. Excluding the results of the EG UK Business, which was acquired on October 31, 2023, and the results of the Arthur Business, which was consolidated from May 31, 2023, the chart below presents the breakdown of our 2023 revenue by product category (food, general merchandise, clothing and petrol), and channel (stores and online (including George.com)). _(Source: Asda information.

For more information on our differentiated operating model, see “—Key Strengths—We benefit from a differentiated operating model.”_ Between 2021 and 2023, our average profit margin (defined as profit for the year divided by revenue) was 4.3%, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.2% (including fuel), our cumulative cash flows from operating activities totalled £3,340.6 million, cumulative free cash flow was approximately £2,097 million and our average cash conversion was 68%. See “Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial _Data—Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_ We believe that our business, operating model and financial performance also benefit from our significant freehold real estate asset portfolio, which also can provide a potential source of liquidity. See “Valuation Report.” In 2023, through the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions and 2023 Ground Rent Transaction, we have been able to, and in the future may continue to, selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to take advantage of favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities. See “—Lease Agreements.” 159 ----- We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we maintain a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom. We have made more than £300 million annualized price investment since 2022 across over 1,200 lines. Within the UK value market, we have strong market shares across core grocery products (13.1%), beers, wines and spirits (12.8%), impulse grocery (12.1%), household and pet (12.1%), frozen (11.4%) and total grocery (11.4%) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). Our offer is strong across the full food basket: our category market shares range from 9.6% to 13.1% (except health and beauty)(in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel). We believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal Asda data, our prices are approximately 2.5% to 6.1% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on the average of the first eight weeks in 2024, based on total goods price gap percentage). We believe our prices continue to compete with those of discounters such as Lidl and Aldi. In January 2024, we launched a new price matching programme where we have price matched Aldi and Lidl on approximately 300 comparable grocery products, which reduced prices by an average of 17% to match whichever discounter had the lowest price on these products. Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is supplemented by a large clothing and general merchandise business. We offer our entire range of food and non-food products to customers as an accessible “one-stop shop” experience that is supported and enhanced by our strong online offer and expansion into the convenience market under the Asda Express banner. We believe our omni-channel offer, through which we reach customers at our brick-and-mortar stores and through our significant online offering and on our app, appeals to our customers. The COVID-19 pandemic increased use of and engagement with our online platforms. In the first half of 2021, there were approximately 8.6 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with order growth from approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended February 28, 2020) to an average of more than 773,000 weekly orders in 2021 (based on the average weekly orders for the first 26 weeks of 2021) and a peak of more than 850,000 orders during the third lockdown (based on the seven days to January 15, 2021). Online engagement has fallen from the peaks experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, but we have continued to grow our online business, with an average of approximately 774,000 weekly orders in 2022 and 2023 (based on the average weekly orders in 2022 and 2023). We also offer at-home delivery and customers are able to collect their purchases at one of approximately 460 Asda Click & Collect sites. Our business model integrates our store-based and online offer by leveraging our stores to fulfil online orders. Our online grocery business is profitable within one of the world’s most developed online grocery markets. According to Kantar Worldpanel, as of January 21, 2024, we operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, holding 19.3% of market share (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales), growing our market share in a market that is 5.5% larger on a one-year basis (comparing Total Grocery Absolute Online Sales from the 52 weeks ended January 22, 2023 to the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024). Our online business is already of significant scale; the chart below shows the growth of our online sales, including a breakdown of online grocery versus George.com sales, for the periods presented. _(Source: Asda information.)_ 160 ----- According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the third-largest online clothing, footwear and accessories retailer in the United Kingdom by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024 and we held 8.5% of the total UK online clothing, footwear and accessories market by volume for the 24 weeks ended January 7, 2024. Combined sales for our online grocery business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion (of which £1.5 billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £3.6 billion in 2023 (of which £3.2 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR of 16.2% between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, our ‘toyou’ service allows customers to conveniently collect and return orders from George.com and other partner retailers at our stores. We have partnered with 112 brands and processed more than 4.4 million parcels in the year ended December 31, 2023. We also have a strong presence in the convenience market with significant opportunity for additional expansion in this fast-growing sector. In October 2022, we took our first notable step into the convenience market after acquiring 132 sites including 129 convenience sites attached to forecourts from the Co-op (the “Co-op sites,” and such business, the “Arthur Business”) and three development sites as part of the Arthur Acquisition. We agreed to divest 13 of the Co-op sites following the recommendation of the CMA after an Initial Enforcement Order stemming from its review of the acquisition. The disposals of these sites completed across December 2023 to January 2024 for proceeds of £25.2 million. Each Co-op site included a grocery retail store between 1,500 and 3,000 square feet of space and an attached petrol filling station driving footfall. In October 2023, we acquired the majority of EG Group’s business in the United Kingdom for total cash consideration of £2.1 billion (including transaction fees). The deal represented a major step in our convenience proposition, adding 356 well-invested PFSs to our convenience portfolio, 161 of which are stand-alone and 195 of which are co-located with foodservice concessions, as well as 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). In foodservice, we acquired franchises for some of the United Kingdom’s best loved outlets, including Greggs, Subway, Burger King and Sbarro, as well as our own proprietary brand, Leon. Certain of our acquired sites also continue to benefit from an additional KFC and Starbucks non-Group branded offerings operated by third parties. Through this acquisition, we accessed another high-growth sector, foodservice, tapping into a new market which is highly complementary to Asda’s current offering. Each of the acquired sites are community-focused and strategically located at the heart of residential areas with a diversified footprint across the United Kingdom, and represent broader retail destinations with ancillary services such as parcel delivery, car wash and last mile food delivery, with opportunity to expand further. The acquired sites also present a significant opportunity for further synergies across Asda’s business through higher volumes, buying synergies and cost savings through operational leverage. In September 2023, we began the conversion of the Co-op sites from Co-op branding to our Asda Express banner, implementing Asda pricing across fuel and grocery upon conversion. We completed the conversion of the remaining convenience sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in March 2024. Total capex investment to convert the stores to Asda Express was approximately £17 million. We believe we will be able to bring Asda’s great value to even more customers across the United Kingdom by reaching new communities and shoppers with this smaller store format. In the converted Co-op sites, our Asda Express prices were an average of 6.1% cheaper than their corresponding prices under Co-op ownership. We also have further organic Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in 2023 and a strong pipeline of approximately 40 sites that have been identified for potential opening in 2024. Going forward, our focus will be on the continued integration of the Co-op sites and EG UK Business into the Asda Group and delivering synergies. Currently, with our team of approximately 150,000 flexible and engaged colleagues, with around 98,000 fulltime employees, serving approximately 16.8 million customer trips each week (based on the average of weeks 37 to 40 of 2023), we are committed to and deeply invested in the UK food supply chain. Our business model is supported by diversification. First, we are a mass market retailer that serves the entire UK population, in terms of both customer demographics and geography, with our customer base skewing slightly towards value-seeking families, younger shoppers and lower-income customers who are attracted by our strategy to offer high quality products at low prices and with strong market shares in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. For more information about our customer mix, see “—Our Customers,” and for more information about the geographic distribution of our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.” Second, we believe we are well-positioned geographically, with a strong regional footprint across the United Kingdom. Our store footprint is strongest in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Our large and diverse store estate offers customers a variety of differentiated shopping formats. We operate 30 supercentres, 396 superstores, 153 supermarkets, 30 Asda Living stores, 499 convenience sites 161 ----- (including our petrol filling stations) and 124 stand-alone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). For more information on our stores, see “—Our Store Formats.” We continue to benefit from certain support provided by Walmart through the Transitional Agreements, primarily in relation to the continued use of its IT platform. We have set up a dedicated team to facilitate the transition of our IT environment away from the Walmart ecosystem and onto a stand-alone IT solution, which we refer to as Project Future. We believe Project Future presents significant opportunities in terms of our efficiency, data capabilities, customer experience and competitive edge and are targeting complete separation from Walmart by the end of 2024. See “—Our Technology and Information Systems,” “Certain Relationships and Related Party _Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart” and “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Acquisitions— Delays in our ability to separate from Walmart could result in significant cost and any issues with the separation process, particularly related to our transition to a new IT system, could significantly disrupt business operations and impact our ability to meet our strategic objectives.”_",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,History,18.8.1,,"Headquartered in Leeds, we are an omni-channel retailer across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. We have built our business on listening to our diverse range of customers, offering what they need at the best value and bringing innovation to the UK market. We were founded in 1965 through the merger of the Asquith family grocery business with the Associated Dairies company in Yorkshire. Our name is derived from this historic merger, combining “Asquith” and “Dairies” to form “Asda.” Founded in the North of England, we have a rich history, heritage and culture. The Asquith family has deep ties to the grocery business, W.R. Asquith having run a butcher’s shop in Knottingley, West Yorkshire, which eventually expanded to seven shops. W.R. Asquith’s sons, Peter and Fred, went on to create the United Kingdom’s first self-service supermarket in Castleford, introducing food discounting to the UK grocery market, and eventually co-founded Asda. In parallel to the growth of the Asquith family business, a group of West Riding dairy farmers joined forces, eventually becoming Associated Dairies & Farm Stores Limited led by Arthur Stockdale. Arthur’s son, Sir Noel Stockdale, went on to co-found Asda with Peter and Fred Asquith. In 1965, we acquired GEM, a major U.S. discount retailer operating in the United Kingdom. With the addition of general merchandise to the former GEM stores, we introduced the superstore to the UK market, a landmark event in the development of UK retailing. To complement this offer, Peter Asquith also introduced the first discounted petrol filling station. By 1970, we operated over 30 stores and were poised to expand beyond our original home in the North of England. Throughout the 1970s, we grew our presence in the South of England, opening stores in Newport, Plymouth and Gosport. In 1977, we launched our “Asda Price” TV adverts, featuring the “pocket tap” which came to be the official sign language for Asda. By the end of the 1970s, we were operating over 80 stores and opened our 100[th] store in 1981. Throughout the 1980s, we focused on expanding our distribution capabilities, opening seven new distribution centres strategically located throughout the United Kingdom by 1985. In 1987, our flagship Watford store opened, another landmark in UK retailing, and featured the longest-ever checkout bank at the time, with 45 checkouts. In 1988, we opened our headquarters in Leeds, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher overseeing the opening ceremonies. In 1989, George Davies was asked to produce a line of clothing for us that was high-quality, high-value and had its own identity: the pioneering George brand was born. In the 1990s, we developed the Asda Way of Working, an innovative framework for a new organisational structure that focuses on our stores and promotes colleague involvement, which set the stage for the Asda culture of today. In 1996, we opened our first Asda Pharmacy location in Harrogate, North Yorkshire and launched our “Tickled Pink” campaign to raise money for the fight against breast cancer, a partnership that continues to this day. In 1998, we began our online retail operations with a dedicated depot in Croydon. 162 ----- In 1999, we joined the Walmart family, becoming part of the world’s largest retailer. Throughout the early 2000s, we continued to grow and innovate, expanding our online and Click & Collect offers, opening our first Asda Living store and our first Eco Store, winning awards for the value we offer customers as well as for the positive environment we create for colleagues, launching our Free From and Extra Special offers, launching stand-alone PFSs as well as Asda Opticians. In 2015, we celebrated our 50[th] birthday and George’s 25[th] birthday. Asda has continued to innovate, including the United Kingdom’s first parcel tower, which allows customers to collect online orders in less than 60 seconds, and voice-activated shopping through Google Home. In October 2020, the Issa Brothers and TDR Capital reached an agreement with Walmart to acquire a majority stake in Asda, with Walmart retaining an equity interest in the business. Following regulatory approval, the deal closed in February 2021 and our new owners were able to take operational control in June 2021. In October 2022, we took our first significant step into the convenience market and acquired 116 convenience sites from the Co-operative Group (“Co-op”) as part of the Arthur Acquisition, expanding our community-focused reach of retail destinations and petrol filling station driving footfall in strategic locations at the heart of residential areas. On October 31, 2023, we greatly expanded our footprint in the convenience market and completed the purchase of the majority of the EG UK business for total cash consideration of £2.1 billion (including transaction fees), adding a total of 480 sites to our portfolio (consisting of 356 petrol filling stations, two of which have since closed, and 124 foodservice sites) through the EG UK Acquisition. In March 2024, we completed the conversion of the acquired Co-op sites and EG UK Business sites to Asda Express. We look forward to exciting prospects in this new market, including the expansion of the Asda Express convenience format to new locations. Our values are rooted in service to our customers, respect for the individual, striving for excellence and acting with integrity.

Although the United Kingdom’s GDP declined by 10.4% in 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, GDP rebounded in 2021, returned to pre-COVID-19 levels in 2022 and amounted to approximately £2.0 trillion in 2023, according to Fitch Solutions, with an average expected GDP growth of approximately 0.4% from 2023 to 2025. The UK grocery retail market is also characterised by favourable demographic characteristics, including a growing population. According to ONS, the UK population is projected to grow from 67 million in 2021 to over 73 million by 2036, which is expected to result in an overall increase in the consumer base for groceries. In addition to its historical stability, the UK grocery retail market is also resilient. In 2023, grocery retail was the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom – valued at £200.5 billion on a Retail Value RSP (as defined herein) basis, according to Euromonitor. Groceries are a necessary and stable consumer expenditure, which generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets that involve more discretionary spending. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history during and following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic: between 2009 and 2016, the UK grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 2.2% and between 2016 and 2023, the UK grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 3.1%, with a growth CAGR of 4.6% during the COVID-19 pandemic from 2019 and 2020. Additionally, during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, according to 163 ----- ONS, the percentage of average weekly household spend on food and non-alcoholic drinks remained fairly consistent at approximately 11.0%, demonstrating the market’s resilience during periods of macroeconomic difficulty, and this percentage spiked to 14.4% in 2021 during the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting an increase in at-home consumption during the pandemic. This percentage has remained relatively flat in the intervening years, ranging between 10.5% and 11.8% from 2007 to 2022. In recent years, as the COVID-19 global pandemic was waning, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sparked an energy crisis which further accelerated growing inflation and cost of living pressures. However, according to Kantar Worldpanel, the UK grocery market, comprised of grocers (and excluding non-grocers), has grown by 8.7% over the past three years (on a Till Roll basis for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024, compared to the 52 weeks ended January 24, 2021). _We are the United Kingdom’s third-largest grocer, holding sizeable market share_ According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom, with 13.7% of market share and the second-largest grocery retailer in the North of England, Scotland and Wales (based on Till Roll data over 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024). For the year ended December 31, 2023, our revenue was £21.9 billion (excluding fuel). We have a network of over 1,200 large stores and convenience sites throughout the United Kingdom, with a particular focus on superstores, supermarkets, online formats and convenience. We are also the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom by value (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of January 21, 2024, according to Kantar Worldpanel), and have grown our market share over many years, maintaining this share in a much-enlarged market as customers turned to online shopping throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we believe that we are well-positioned as a large and established business with a clear set of peers. We also believe that our multi-format, omni-channel offer positions us well to compete effectively and to continue growing our market share. Following the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition, which gave us a significant foothold in the convenience and foodservice markets, our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2023 were £25,619.9 million and £1,078 million, respectively, compared to £24,477.8 million and £867 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022. We believe that we also hold a leading position in the UK foodservice market. We cater to a broad target demographic, which we believe provides us a long-term competitive advantage. In contrast to discounters, we provide a broad range of branded and own-brand offers, while also having a more developed and established online platform. _We believe we have faced the greatest impacts of discounters on our market_ The adverse impact of discounters (primarily Aldi and Lidl) on the traditional grocers in recent years has been significant but, while we believe that discounters will continue to put pressure on the market, we believe that we and other traditional grocers have already faced the greatest impacts of this competition in the markets in which we operate and, if anything, that the discounters pose a greater challenge to other traditional grocers, who we believe are more geographically exposed to the areas where discounters are likely to focus in the near-term. As compared to our traditional grocer peers, our geographical concentration is in the North of England, Scotland and Wales, as evidenced by our number two market shares in those regions. The discounters have already penetrated these areas and we expect the discounters to continue to shift the focus of their expansion to the South of England, the East of England and London, where we operate fewer sites as compared to the Midlands, the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Furthermore, the catchment areas of 76.7% of our stores already contain both major discounters, Aldi and Lidl, which is a higher percentage than any of our traditional grocer competitors (the boundary used is a 10-minute drive-time radius around each point, which is consistent regardless of location type or size of store, but excludes convenience stores, and stores are only included in the count where there is both Aldi and Lidl stores present within the drive-time boundary). Therefore, we believe that our current performance already factors in the adverse impact of discounters to a large extent. Moreover, according to Kantar Worldpanel, we have stemmed the losses to the discounters in recent months, and we have reduced switching losses to the discounters to a two-year record low for the 4 weeks ended February 18, 2024. Together, Lidl and Aldi account for 17.5% of the market, with Aldi’s share at 9.8% and Lidl at 7.6% in each case on the basis of Till Roll data and according to Kantar Worldpanel for the 52 weeks ended January 21, 2024. 164 ----- However, the growth experienced by the discounters has begun to fall sharply, with Aldi posting growth behind the market for the four weeks ended January 21, 2024, and Lidl’s growth decreasing over 50% for the same period compared to the four weeks ended January 22, 2023. We also believe we can reduce losses to the discounters through our value proposition, including our opening price point range, Just Essentials. In January 2024, we also launched a new price matching programme where we have price matched Aldi and Lidl on 287 comparable grocery products, which reduced prices by an average of 17% to match whichever discounter had the lowest price on these products. _We have demonstrated resilience through downturns_ Just as our market has proven resilient in times of economic difficulty and uncertainty, our business has also proven resilient during recent economic and market downturns, including during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as through the rise of discounters in the UK grocery retail market in more recent years, particularly during 2014 to 2016. During the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, we continued to perform well, achieving an average like-for-like sales (excluding fuel) growth rate of 6.1% for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009. Our EBITDA margins have also remained stable, ranging from 4.7% to 4.9% between 2007 and 2023. Despite the significant social and economic shifts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, our business experienced strong overall performance, particularly in our online and supermarket formats. Overall, our food business performed consistently throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an initial increase in sales due to panic buying and customers stocking-up on key staples at the outset of each of the first three lockdown periods. Following an initial decline at the beginning of the first lockdown, our general merchandise business also generally performed well throughout these lockdown periods, due to increasing purchases of homeware products. While our clothing business was initially negatively impacted during the early stage of the first UK lockdown period, we experienced improved performance in this business in line with an overall improvement of the general economy and a rebound in consumer confidence. Recently, geopolitical tensions and ongoing inflation above historical norms and the Bank of England’s target have led to uncertainty in the market and for our consumers. However, we have remained highly resilient in the face of these challenges and have kept focused on supporting customers and colleagues with cost-of-living pressures, whilst continuing to deliver strong financial results. During times of economic stress, we believe our value proposition is particularly appealing to customers and can drive sales: we benefited from increased sales generating revenue (excluding fuel) of £21.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 compared to £20.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. As the current high inflationary environment persists, we are focused on initiatives to support our customers in the cost-of-living crisis and protect market share by investing in price and quality, which we believe can drive growth. For example, in 2022, we also launched our new grocery opening price point range, Just Essentials by Asda that expands the range of its predecessor, Asda Smart Price, from approximately 160 to 272 products with new branding and reformulations for taste and quality. In the same year, we also rolled out a “Dropped and Locked” price campaign, where we locked in the prices of over 100 grocery items to give customers certainty around their shopping costs during the year, as well as our loyalty rewards programme, Asda Rewards, as an indirect cost-saving scheme for customers to earn cash back on their shopping.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Key Strengths,18.9.2,"We benefit from a differentiated operating model, including a diversified proposition with unique multi-format and multi-channel offering","_We have well-developed own-brands_ We believe that our own-brand offers have been a key strength of our business and continue to offer growth opportunities. We have an extensive own-brand product range in our food business, with approximately 7,800 own-brand SKUs. Our approach to range development and innovation enables us to identify and meet changing customer needs and has resulted in the creation of many award-winning products; we launched approximately 950 lines in 2021, 1,547 new lines in 2022 and 1,597 new lines in 2023, and approximately 3,858 lines were reformulated in 2023. As a result of the EG UK Acquisition, we also acquired Leon, our own proprietary foodservice brand. In addition to our diverse and extensive product offer with our own-brand range, we have also been able to drive growth through service and price positioning. We leverage our IPL sourcing model to deliver value, especially in our produce, cooked meats and wine segments. In particular, the introduction and development of the opening price point range, 165 ----- Just Essentials, has been key to helping customers with the cost-of-living pressures in 2023 after the “Dropped and Locked” price campaigns in 2022, where we locked in the prices of over 100 grocery items to give customers certainty around their shopping costs during that year. We also offer own-brands through George, see “—The George Clothing _and George Home offers are generally profitable and well-established.” We are driven by our commitment to delivering low prices to our customers_ We believe our commitment to delivering low prices to our customers is a competitive advantage as we aim to lead on price while staying competitive on assortment and quality. We believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal Asda data, our prices are approximately 2.5% to 6.1% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on average for the first eight weeks in 2024, based on total goods price gap percentage). Following the implementation of our Aldi and Lidl price matching programme, which runs alongside our established customer value propositions, including Just Essentials, Asda Smart Price, our price locking campaigns, Fab 5 and Asda Rewards, we believe our prices can compete with those of discounters. Our low prices are supported by rigorous cost control and a commitment to affordability, which enables us to control expenses so that we can pass cost savings on to our customers. _Loyal customer base through our reward loyalty programme, Asda Rewards_ In 2022, we launched our new loyalty programme, Asda Rewards. The app-based scheme enables customers to earn cash back on their shopping, building Asda Pounds in their cash pots to spend in store. The programme also provides the opportunity to leverage data insights which enables us to better target investment in the customer proposition. Asda Rewards total users and penetration among customers has grown quickly, with over 7.5 million new users joining over the last 12 months and a total of 1.6 million members who have registered for Blue Light. The number of total active customers reached 4.9 million as of December 31, 2023 over the prior 30-day period, and the programme has earned around £300 million revenue in 2023. The following graph shows the increasing sales penetration, or the number of sales linked to customers using Asda Rewards since its inception, which reached 50.6% in the week of Christmas in 2023: By the end of 2023, we saw approximately 47% of sales linked to Asda Rewards. We have found that after joining Asda Rewards, members spend more than non-members within every segment and are more likely to become repeat customers. In particular, we believe that members spend more than 10% after joining the programme (measured 166 ----- through tokenised payment cards) and for our high value customers, we believe that this equates to an incremental addition of approximately £11 per week. By driving sales volume, the loyalty scheme has been incrementally profitable since shortly after its launch, and the Retail Media segment has achieved £103.1 million profit. The following graph shows the average sales by quarter of Asda Rewards members versus non-members. _We operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, which is profitable_ The United Kingdom has one of the most developed online grocery retail markets in the world, with one of the highest rates of the population using the internet. There has been a significant shift in the grocery retail market away from brick-and-mortar stores to online purchasing as demographic trends, greater mobile and device usage, improved service proposition and technological advances in applications and customer interfaces have driven increasing penetration rates in the online grocery retail market. We believe we are poised to take advantage of these favourable consumer trends, as we have already established ourselves in the rapidly growing UK online grocery retail market and our store and warehouse footprint is strategically positioned across attractive geographic areas to service the growing demand for groceries online. According to Kantar Worldpanel, we are the second-largest online grocery retail platform in the United Kingdom, holding 19.3% of market share (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) for the 52-week period ended January 21, 2024. Having responded quickly to the increase in demand for online shopping during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have continued to grow our online business, with an average of approximately 774,000 weekly orders in 2022 and 2023 (based on the average weekly orders in 2022 and 2023). As a result of our strong performance in the online market, combined sales for our online grocery business and George.com rapidly increased from previous years to a total of £3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023 (of which £3.2 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales) as compared to £3.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022 (of which £2.9 billion were online grocery sales and £0.4 billion were George.com sales). According to Kantar Worldpanel, we hold an 8.5% share of the UK online clothing, footwear and accessories market (in terms of volume of units sold on a 24-week basis as of January 7, 2024). We believe there is greater scope for our online profitability to improve further. We expect that the demand for online groceries will continue to be strong as customers increasingly adopt online shopping as a more permanent and preferred way to purchase groceries. _The George Clothing and George Home offers are generally profitable and well-established_ We launched our clothing offer, George, in 1990 and it is the third-largest clothing footwear and accessories retailer in the United Kingdom by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024 and is the leading UK childrenswear retailer with 18.7% market share by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended January 7, 2024, in each case according to Kantar Worldpanel. Despite challenges to this product category overall, our online clothing sales have increased from £379.3 million for the year to December 31, 2021 to £423.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2023, with 82% of all sales made via mobile devices in 2023. We believe this demonstrates our strength in the online segment, which is a key part of our operating model. Additionally, we have expanded the George branded offer to include general merchandise, including through collaborations with strategic partners. We have extended 167 ----- product ranges with partners who specialise in certain categories, have a strong affinity fit with our existing customers and bring complementary expertise and reputation, such as in homeware with Stacey Solomon and Claire’s in jewellery and accessories. The George Home brand generated approximately £747.7 million in sales and contributed approximately 50.0% of our total general merchandising sales for the year ended December 31, 2023. Sales by the George Home brand grew at a CAGR of approximately 3% between the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2023. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product categories generally have higher margins than our food product categories.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Key Strengths,18.9.3,We benefit from a well invested and vertically integrated model and are supported by a significant asset base,"_We benefit from vertically integrated procurement through IPL_ We believe that we have a competitive advantage in food sourcing via our captive sourcing arm, IPL, which enables us to take a vertically integrated approach to procurement. We believe that IPL provides us with valuable sourcing differentiation as compared to our competitors. IPL is one of the largest importers of produce in the United Kingdom and, while IPL is a group company and exclusively serves Asda, it is also our largest supplier. The aim of our vertically integrated procurement model is to consolidate import activity for key products and reduce our overall costs. In 2023, we purchased £1,724 million of our products through IPL. The foundation of IPL’s cost-price advantage is that it eliminates the “middleman” who typically serves as the intermediary in the supply chain, thereby giving us greater control of costs, quality and supply of a diverse range of products. We have an extensive IPL footprint across the United Kingdom, with nine processing facilities across the country and more than 3,793 colleagues as of the year ended December 31, 2023. Our IPL product mix is diversified according to our needs, with a mix of 56% fruit and vegetables, 28% protein, 7% plants and flowers, 6% beverages and 3% grocery in 2023. Additionally, we have been able to build upon and benefit from our supplier relationships to deliver supply chain continuity and make progress in our sustainability agenda. For example, through IPL we are supporting industry projects on water stewardship in our produce supply chain. We also believe that IPL has provided greater stability and allowed us greater control over our supply chain now that the United Kingdom has left the European Union’s single market and customs union. IPL’s EU supply chain ensures IPL takes control of the transport direct from its suppliers’ sites. This allows IPL to appoint experts in haulage and freight clearance, removing delays at the various border control points and ensuring the most efficient supply chain. IPL’s logistics team are based in Spain, which is the top EU exporting country into the United Kingdom for fresh produce. This has ensured IPL quickly understands any impacts to supply chains, such as localised disruption by the farming fraternity, allowing IPL to take actions to protect the supply chains. _We are supported by a significant asset portfolio_ We are supported by a well-invested and geographically diversified store estate and benefit from a total real estate portfolio of £8.5 billion, which is comprised of freehold and long leasehold assets, and includes £756 million of certain properties owned by the Group but pledged as collateral for the benefit of the creditors under the Ground Rent Facility. As of December 31, 2023, 77% of our asset portfolio was comprised of freehold or long leaseholds, based upon attributable EBITDAR per property (less central allocations), with certain adjustments made to align the calculation methodology across the Group’s properties following the EG UK Acquisition and the Arthur Acquisition. Of this 77%, 12% is attributable to certain properties that are pledged as collateral for the benefit of the creditors under the Ground Rent Facility. Our valuable real estate portfolio also provides a potential source of liquidity and underpins our strong ongoing cash flow generation. On August 10, 2023, we completed the 2023 Sale and Leaseback Transactions with Realty Income, which resulted in proceeds of £646 million that were used to finance a portion of the EG UK Acquisition. On December 12, 2023, we also completed the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction with a number of investors, which resulted in proceeds of £400 million that were used to repay a bridge loan that was used to finance a portion of the EG UK Acquisition. In the future we may continue to selectively monetise portions of our real estate portfolio to take advantage of favourable trading conditions and pursue our strategic priorities.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Key Strengths,18.9.4,We have strong exposure to the resilient convenience and PFS channel with upside through synergies,"In December 2022, we opened our first two convenience sites under the Asda Express banner. We also have further organic Asda Express openings planned, with seven sites opened in early 2024 and a strong pipeline of approximately 30 sites that have been identified for potential opening in 2024. The Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition gave us a strong presence in the fast-growing convenience market, having added 472 convenience sites and petrol filling stations to our portfolio. The Arthur Acquisition comprised 116 convenience stores with PFSs attached and the EG UK Acquisition comprised 356 PFSs (including two that have since been shut) with convenience stores and 124 standalone foodservice sites (including 10 non-active sites). These acquisitions accelerated our growth in the convenience sector and strategic ambition to bring our value heritage as a consumer champion to even more customers. We completed the conversion of all the sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in March 2024. See also “— _Business Strategy—Location.” We believe our recent acquisitions will drive our results by delivering additional net_ working capital and EBITDA synergies as we integrate buying for the wider convenience network into Asda and seek to drive higher volumes and growth as a result of price investment in the fuel and grocery offering. We also expect synergies to arise from range optimisation, monetisation of customer data, our increased scale, in-store marketing income, improvement in fuel card terms and operational efficiencies. See “Summary Historical Consolidated _Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Other Financial Indicators.”_ According to Euromonitor, in 2023, the UK convenience market was approximately £44 billion and the UK foodservice market was approximately £67 billion, and the UK convenience market has grown at a faster rate than the UK grocery retail market relative to 2015. Our exposure to these highly attractive and profitable convenience and foodservice markets is underpinned by favourable structural factors including (i) the rise of shopping locally, (ii) the evolution of shopper missions, (ii) the shift of our offering to a broader format of retail destinations, and (iv) our shift into the foodservice and consumption market.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.9,Key Strengths,18.9.5,We have achieved a successful financial profile,"We have achieved a successful financial profile that is underpinned by strong profit margins, Adjusted EBITDA margins, cash flows from operating activities, Free Cash Flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less Capital Expenditure KPI) and Cash Conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. Between the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2023, our average profit margin (defined as profit for the year divided by revenue) was 4.3%, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 4.2% (including fuel), our cash flows from operating activities totalled £3,340.6 million, cumulative free cash flow was approximately £2,097 million and our average cash conversion was 68%. This strong financial performance is driven by our commitment to deliver low prices to our clients, diverse product offer, strong own-brand grocery offer, expanded convenience and foodservice offerings and well-established George-branded product categories. Our Adjusted EBITDA margins have benefitted from our cost transformation programmes, which have generated SG&A cost savings without compromising the low prices we offer our customers. We are a structurally negative working capital business driven by growth in payables, and the beneficial payment terms to suppliers versus payments received by consumers instantly on purchase. We delivered a strong net working capital performance in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2023, with our active working capital management, resulting in increased working capital inflows in those two years. Furthermore, we have pursued a disciplined approach to our capital expenditure over time, with the aim of maintaining and improving our real estate platform rather than opening new sites.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Together with Michael Gleeson, the Group’s chief financial officer, our executive committee provides strong, dynamic and deep, leadership. We also benefit from the long-standing experience, market expertise, business relationships and industry know-how of our shareholder, Mohsin Issa, who is leading the management team on an interim basis. 169 ----- As we continue to expand our footprint and achieve our business goals, we plan to take advantage of opportunities to further enhance and supplement our management talent, both from inside our organisation as well as with external candidates. We have made key investments into our digital marketing team and expect to onboard a new chief digital officer in the third quarter of 2024.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Business Strategy,18.10.1,Proposition,"Our proposition strategy is about creating more reasons to shop with us than anywhere else and providing an offering that meets all of our customers’ needs under one roof. Demonstrating the strength in our offering across the store, we recently won four awards at the 2023 annual Grocer Gold Awards, including the Grocer 33 Price award for the 26th consecutive year, the ‘Own Label Range of the Year’ award for our Just Essentials product range, the ‘Consumer Initiative of the Year’ award for our Kids Eat for £1 Cafe Meals scheme and ‘Online Supermarket of the Year.’ We believe we are well established as the lowest-price full-selection retailer in the United Kingdom, and we lead the traditional grocers in terms of lowest price. Moving forward, we intend to reduce the complexity of the customer shopping experience so that we can reflect that benefit to customers’ prices where it matters most in our value proposition. We aim to simplify our value proposition to maintain price leadership, further improve quality perception and continue to improve customer experience in-store and online. We also strive to create a more hassle-free customer experience in-store with our digital transformation. For example, we have broadened our Scan&Go services that allows customers to use a handset or the Scan&Go mobile app to scan and bag items as they shop and utilise a dedicated checkout area for quick and easy payment. We have also transformed our approach to rewarding customer loyalty through the launch of Asda Rewards in 2022, our innovative, app-based loyalty scheme that gives customers Asda pounds, not points. Customers earn cash back on their shopping, with regularly updated missions and star products enabling extra savings. Since 2022, more than 5 million of our customers enrolled in Asda Rewards and as of December 31, 2023, Asda Rewards resulted in a total of £383 million customer savings since it was first trialled. Following this initial success, we plan to look into different ways to offer even further value to our customers, “gamefy” the application and to monetise and utilise the data it provides. We believe that this approach will allow us to grow our customer analytics platform to bring better, faster and deeper customer insights to our investment decisions and to improve the overall customer experience by personalising our offer. Through Asda Rewards, we are also able to roll out seasonal offerings such as our Christmas Saver Cashpot that enabled customers save up their cash pot earnings in preparation for the festive period, with approximately 1.7 million members saving approximately £50 million into their 2023 Christmas Cashpots. We offered saving incentives where customers who transferred savings earned from their Asda Rewards cash pot into their Christmas Saver Cashpot received additional cash bonuses based upon the amount transferred. With improved availability and seasonal 170 ----- offerings, we continue to earn our place in customers’ minds as the retailer for key celebrations throughout the year. We believe that such rewards incentives will further drive customer loyalty and retention. In non-food, we have begun trialling a number of initiatives across clothing and general merchandise in our “lab stores.” We use the lab-store as a platform to test new technologies, concepts and ideas and assess what works for customers and colleagues. For example, we tested a “shop within a shop” concept with our Big Asda Toyshop, which had its own merchandising and look and feel, in eight stores in 2022. Following strong sales, we have rolled it out in an additional 121 stores. For Halloween in 2023, we trialled a new approach to the store entrance, creating an inviting and festive shopping environment. Through these and other concepts, we have overhauled the in-store shopping experience, radically rethinking our use of space, lighting and merchandising and are looking at how to replicate with new themes and categories on a regular basis across the portfolio. We also aim to grow Asda as a platform by forming partnerships that enable us to provide a broader set of relevant branded products and services, while also building upon our existing capabilities, such as logistics and our customer-facing ‘toyou’ proposition. We believe adding partners to our platform will result in the creation of appealing “one-stop-shop” store destinations for more customer missions. We believe these partnerships will not only provide additional income through rent and revenue share models but will also create a positive effect on our overall business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Business Strategy,18.10.2,Product,"Our goal under our product strategy is to make desirable products affordable. We aim to modernise our brand and deliver the best value to our customers, helping them fulfil their money saving goals without needing to compromise on quality. We began our product transformation in 2022 with the overhaul of our opening price point range, Just Essentials by Asda. This line is a key part of our strategy to make desirable products that are affordable. In 2023, we also locked in the price of over 500 popular products until the end of the summer to give customers certainty around their budgets. We delivered three key price drops in 2023, lowering the prices on over 800 high volume lines, including in October 2023 where we lowered prices by an average of 14% on many of our popular products. We will look to continue dropping prices where possible and aim to pass price drops straight onto customers where we can. As inflation is starting to ease in certain areas, we are working with our suppliers and IPL to ensure our customers feel the benefit of those reductions. As part of this brand reset, we are also focused on our mid-tier value and range offerings, investing throughout our own brand offering to drive customers to reappraise us on quality. We launched our new scratch cooking and meal solutions ranges and have introduced new own-label meal solutions brands, including Health Menu, Take-Out Club, the Indian-inspired Bom Bahia and pan-Asian-inspired House of Yum ranges, and Bistro, a selection of hearty pub-style favourites. These ranges are designed to compete directly with the likes of M&S Gastropub and takeaway brands, a key opportunity as customers switch to at-home spending amidst cost-of-living pressures. We launched ambitious quality and taste match campaigns during 2023 to demonstrate our confidence in the quality and value of our products, including Harrod’s blind taste test products and M&S Taste Match campaign across a range of popular household items. In the M&S Taste Match campaign, hundreds of our products were voted “as tasty” or “tastier than” their M&S equivalents, but at a lower cost, in a blind taste testing conducted by Cambridge Market Research. Foodservice and chilled categories also represent an avenue for growth and are important in moving the dial on customers’ quality perception. A strong proposition in these categories is essential for fulfilling our ambition of becoming a key market player in the convenience market. In non-food, we launched ‘Exclusively at George’ in May 2023, which was dubbed the first-ever supermarket elevated fashion collection. It put a spotlight on high-quality fabrics, with a focus on both quality and style. Following the success of ‘Exclusively at George,’ we introduced the Studio Edit, which will be a permanent premium arm of the George range, with a focus on wardrobe staples, premiere fabrics and finishing touches typically found in more expensive pieces. Continuing in the elevated lifestyle space, we partnered with TV presenter and influencer Stacey Solomon to create the homeware range, ‘At Home with Stacey Solomon Exclusively for George Home’ in August 2023. We believe these lines showcase our ability to deliver high quality, highly desired products across a broad range of categories to meet our customers’ every day needs. 171 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Business Strategy,18.10.3,Location,"As part of our location strategy, we seek to be accessible however and whenever we are needed. We believe that customers seeing Asda in new locations and new formats will help us broaden our customer base. In 2022, we made significant progress in our location strategic priority area, increasing our expansion into the convenience sector. Our core focus in our location strategy is on the successful integration of the recent Arthur Acquisition and EG UK Acquisition, which together added 472 convenience sites and petrol filling stations and 124 standalone foodservice sites to our portfolio. In September 2023, we began the conversion of the Co-op sites from Co-op branding to our Asda Express banner, implementing Asda pricing across fuel and grocery upon conversion. We completed the conversion of the remaining convenience sites acquired from the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition to Asda Express in March 2024. We believe we will be able to bring Asda’s great value to even more customers across the United Kingdom by reaching new communities and shoppers with this smaller store format. In the converted Co-op sites, our Asda Express prices were an average of 6.1% cheaper than their corresponding prices under Co-op ownership. We also have further organic Asda Express openings planned to bolster our location strategy. Going forward, our focus will be on the continued integration of the Co-op sites and EG UK Business into the Asda Group and delivering synergies. Beyond our expansion into the convenience market, we plan to continue to drive growth and market share gains in the online channel through the expansion of our online grocery channel’s capacity to meet increased consumer demand. We continue to seek to optimise our online grocery operating model and further develop our already profitable economic model through the ongoing assessment of our online product range and promotions, further monetisation of our e-commerce assets, as well as other initiatives. In addition to growing our core online grocery business, we are targeting further growth by expanding the reach of our online platform and expanding our delivery services. We expect to provide customers with greater and more convenient access to our product range by accelerating our last-mile delivery capabilities via partnerships.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Business Strategy,18.10.4,Experience,"The goal of our experience strategy is to make shopping with us easy and enjoyable. We are focused on operational excellence, testing scalable operational innovation for end-to-end service improvement. We are currently looking at changes to further improve availability in store, improve stock flow and drive effective labour management. For example, we are trialling artificial intelligence (“AI”) cameras to identify gaps in product availability and optimise stock management in store. We believe this is an example of how AI could significantly help improve the customer experience and optimise our colleagues’ time to focus on delivering high quality service. We are also striving towards a best-in-class shopping experience that gives customers the range they desire in an environment that’s easy to navigate. Our current store design had not been updated for many years, so our near-term strategy includes modernising our stores to facilitate a better customer journey. In order to ensure our colleagues are equipped to offer a best-in-class customer experience, we are also investing in colleague hours in-store via a combination of additional temporary colleagues in stores and opportunities for existing colleagues to work over-time if they wish to. Increasing the numbers of hours being worked in store means that more colleagues are on hand to serve customers across the busy and peak periods (such as Christmas). Alongside value and choice, we believe that service is a key quality signifier for customers and impacts where they choose to shop. To help further this strategy, we also hired David Hills as our new Chief Customer Officer in September 2023, who brings a wealth of retail and grocery-sector experience to our business and will play a pivotal role in providing our shoppers a hassle-free and pleasurable experience when shopping at Asda.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.10,Business Strategy,18.10.5,Commitment to ESG targets and building a sustainable business for the long term,"Part of our strategy is to ensure our Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) commitments are fully integrated into our wider business transformation plans. We believe the sales opportunity driven by eco-active shoppers, or shoppers who are highly concerned about the environment and are actively taking actions to reduce their waste, is expected to reach approximately £2 billion across the market by the year 2027. We believe ESG is a key 172 ----- decision enabler for customers in deciding where to shop and that setting the right ESG plan is beneficial for our customers, colleagues and investors. Our ESG strategy is focused on four pillars: healthy and sustainable choices (providing our customers with a product mix that is healthier and with a lower environmental impact), energy and climate change mitigation (reducing our greenhouse gas emissions), nature positive (sourcing and farming which respects and restores) and waste (reducing food, product and packaging waste). In August 2023, we published our third ESG report (based on 2022 data), which provided an annual update on the progress we had made towards supporting these pillars and meeting our environmental targets and in October 2023, we received our first external assessment of our ESG strategy, with an entity score of 54 points and an overall rating of 3 (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the strongest) by the financial services ratings’ agency Sustainable Fitch. Sustainable Fitch positively assessed our human and labour rights policies, gender balanced workforce and well-defined management systems, as well as our actions to increase the share of non-high fat, salt and sugar own-brand products and improve food nutrition labelling. Obtaining this rating is part of our ongoing commitment to transparently reporting on our efforts to achieve our ESG targets. For example, we have continued to reduce our operational carbon footprint, with emissions down 8% from 2021 to 2022 and 40% from 2015 to 2022, and we believe we are well on the way to achieving our commitment to reduce emissions 50% by 2025 and reaching net zero emissions by 2040. We have committed to setting a near-term science-based carbon reduction target, including a specific Forests, Land and Agriculture (“FLAG”) target. These targets have been submitted to the Science-Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”) for validation. The proposed targets were submitted before the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition so reflect our footprint prior to these acquisitions. In terms of waste reduction, over 90% of our own brand packaging was recyclable in 2022, and we donated over 2,000 tonnes of surplus food through our charity partnerships, both reducing waste and supporting those in need during challenging times. We increased the proportion of our own-label packaging that can be recycled at the kerbside to 88% (with a further 4.7% recyclable in store) and introduced the Refill Price Guarantee on our in-store refill zones, guaranteeing that unpackaged products are cheaper than their packaged equivalents. We reused or repurposed 86% of our operational waste and sent zero operational waste to landfill in 2022. We believe we have made significant progress towards our ESG goals but that there is still much to do, and we will continue working to build a sustainable business for the long term.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Our strategy is centred around four primary pillars which guide our business priorities and planning: proposition, product, location and experience. These pillars are underpinned by our commitment to running an efficient operating model, driving the business through improved data and systems and an ESG programme that builds a sustainable business for the long term. Through our strategy, we seek to maintain and extend our advantage in offering value for money by ensuring that our prices are competitive and reassuring shoppers on quality. We aim to provide a consistent, trusted experience, incentivising customers not to shop elsewhere through the creation of attractive store propositions and partnerships that increase our appeal to customers. We serve our customers with our team of flexible and engaged colleagues, while increasing the number of self-serve opportunities and transforming the in-store experience.

Our physical retail business operates under five distinct formats: supercentres and superstores, supermarkets, Asda Living, convenience sites and stand-alone foodservice sites. For more information on our store formats, see “— _Our Store Formats.”_ We aim to develop Asda as a platform by forming partnerships that enable us to provide a broader set of relevant branded products and services while also building on our existing capabilities such as logistics and the customer-facing ‘toyou’ proposition. We believe adding partners to our platform will result in the creation of attractive store destinations, in which more customer missions can be accomplished under one roof.

Our foodservice partners include Greggs, Subway, Burger King and Sbarro, as well as our own proprietary brand, Leon. In addition to these Group-operated branded offerings, the sites acquired from the EG UK Acquisition will also continue to benefit from additional KFC and Starbucks branded offerings operated by third parties.

Delivery orders are fulfilled either from our home shopping centres, which are dedicated fulfilment centres for online grocery orders, or from Asda stores, depending on the customer’s location. This in-store online model proved effective in responding to rapid increases in demand during the COVID-19-related lockdowns in the United Kingdom and we believe this demonstrates our ability to scale our online offering quickly to meet customer demand. Our online delivery covers a comprehensive portion of the United Kingdom and delivery to customers is primarily made by Asda colleagues using our van fleet. For deliveries, customers book a delivery slot and can choose to either pay per delivery or to sign up for a monthly or annual delivery pass, allowing customers up to one delivery per day on orders over £40 for a fixed price.

In May 2022, we launched a new grocery opening price point range, Just Essentials by Asda. This range replaced the existing budget offering, Asda Smart Price, expanding the range from approximately 160 to 272 products with new branding and products reformulated for taste and quality. The total range is designed to enable customers to keep the household running on a budget. The range is a key part of our strategy to make desirable products affordable, giving customers the opportunity to reappraise our quality and value offering. Throughout 2022, our Asda Rewards programme was introduced as an indirect cost-saving scheme for customers to earn cash back on their shopping and we also ran our “Dropped and Locked” price campaign, which was aimed at supporting UK households tackling inflation. The “Dropped and Locked” campaign locked in the prices of over 100 grocery items, including fresh fruit and vegetables, fresh meat, store cupboard favourites like rice and noodles, as well as soft drinks, desserts, frozen products and non-HFSS (as defined below) products. As a result, prices on these products dropped by an average of 12% and locked until the end of 2022 to give customers certainty around their shopping in light of these cost-of-living pressures. In 2023, we continued our commitment to our customers through various price drop and freezing initiatives and in 2024, we introduced “Fab 5,” which offers our customers five of our “fabulous” quality fruit and vegetables (on a weekly basis) at a low price of under £1, both in store and online.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

It touts itself a fast-food restaurant with a twist: serving fresh meals with healthy, nutritious food and a strong emphasis on vegan and vegetarian dishes complimented by high quality meat offerings. We acquired all of Leon’s owned and operated locations as part of the EG UK Acquisition, which excludes certain franchised locations for which we now act as franchisor. Our Leon operations include 54 locations, one of which is co-located at a PFS and one of which is co-located at our headquarters.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.15,Our Store Formats,18.15.1,,"We believe we have a well-invested and geographically diversified store estate. As of December 31, 2023, 77% of our asset portfolio was comprised of freeholds or long leaseholds, based upon attributable EBITDAR per property (less central allocations), with certain adjustments made to align the calculation methodology across the Group’s properties following the EG UK Acquisition and the Arthur Acquisition. Of this 77%, 12% is attributable to certain properties that are pledged as collateral for the benefit of the creditors under the Ground Rent Facility. Alternatively, as of December 31, 2023 and calculated as the number of freehold operating retail units as a percentage of total number of operating retail units, 52.6% of our asset portfolio was freehold; freehold percentage also includes 180 ----- certain properties that are freehold with a partial leasehold or which are leasehold properties for which the leases have been classed as long leasehold for the purposes of this calculation as those leases have nil or a peppercorn ground rent. We have made around £500 million cumulative investment in the estate between 2021 and 2023. We operate five distinct store formats: (i) supercentres and superstores, (ii) supermarkets, (iii) Asda Living, (iv) convenience and (v) foodservice. - _Supercentres and superstores: Supercentres are our largest stores (typically exceeding a net sales area of 80,000 square feet), offering our extended range across food, George and non-food, often supported by partnership offers and an extended range of services through photo printing specialists, dry cleaners, pharmacies, opticians, cafés and fuel. Superstores are large supermarkets (with a net sales area ranging between 15,000 and 80,000 square feet), providing a more limited non-food offer and a smaller range of services than our supercentres including through photo printing specialists, dry cleaners, pharmacies, opticians, cafés and fuel. - Supermarkets: Supermarkets are our small, usually local, stores (with a net sales area of less than 15,000 square feet) typically providing customers with a selected food range that, offers general groceries such as food, beverage and household non-food products. Our supermarkets do not typically offer extended services apart from fuel. - Asda Living: Asda Living are dedicated general merchandise stores, containing selected non-food ranges including our George Clothing and George Home offers, home electronics, toys, homewares, health, and beauty products. - Convenience: Our convenience offering consists of two offerings. - Conveniently located small non-fuel stores (with a net sales area of less than 3,000 square feet) that offer a wide variety of food-for-now or food-for-later ranges and includes a selected ranges of household products. As of December 31, 2023, we have nine convenience stores. - Petrol filling station (“PFS”) usually complemented by a retail space for small consumable purchases. As of December 31, 2023, we have 490 PFSs. For more information on these retail spaces, see “Our Businesses—Our Retail Business—Food—Fresh—Foodservice.” - _Foodservice: Our foodservice stores format includes stand-alone stores containing either (i) a fast-food outlet offering a selection of branded fast-food counters, or (ii) a Leon food outlet, all located in convenient locations.

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.19,Our Colleagues,18.19.1,,"As of December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 150,000 individuals. Our retail colleagues make up the largest proportion of this, with approximately 85% of our workforce serving customers in store, 9% in the distribution network, and 4% in home offices and 2% in other operations. Typically, our total number of colleagues increases during peak retail periods, such as Easter and Christmas, due to seasonal hires. We are committed to providing colleagues the training, education and incentives they need to strengthen their skills and become part of our community. Our colleagues are subject to standard employment terms, depending on their role, and are provided with colleague handbooks (where relevant) and policies. We have trade union agreements in Asda’s retail and distribution businesses as well as in Asda Express. In our retail business, we have a collective bargaining agreement for hourly-paid colleagues in Northern Ireland and a partnership agreement with the GMB Union (“GMB”) for hourly-paid colleagues who are GMB members in England, Scotland and Wales. In our distribution business, we have a collective bargaining agreement with the GMB for hourly-paid colleagues and a collective bargaining agreement with Unite the Union (“Unite”) and the United Road Transport Union for colleagues in our Lutterworth chilled distribution centre. For Asda Express, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (“Usdaw”) have collective bargaining agreements for hourly and salaried colleagues in sites acquired in connection with the Arthur Acquisition. We recently entered into a collective bargaining agreement with Usdaw for hourly-paid colleagues in Leon, in sites acquired in connection with the EG UK Acquisition and that will be in any new Asda Express site. The GMB partnership agreement covers eight legacy Asda Express sites. We are committed to offering competitive compensation in line with market practices and supporting our colleagues during this high inflationary environment. For example, in April 2023, we voluntarily increased our rate for hourly-paid store colleagues to £11.00 an hour and further increased this in July 2023 to £11.11 an hour. For stores inside the M25 and around Greater London, our rate for hourly-paid store colleagues increased to £12.28. For information related to certain ongoing legal proceedings relating to wages, please see “—Legal Proceedings—Equal _Value Litigation.” We also offer variable compensation to colleagues, including those working in retail and_ distribution, to encourage performance based on the fulfilment of business targets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.20,Our Suppliers and Logistics,18.20.1,,"We operate a “hub and spoke” logistics network, with two hubs and two deconsolidation centres serving 23 depots across the United Kingdom. Our logistics model is designed to support our extensive store and online businesses. This approach starts with suppliers that provide goods to our hubs and depots as well as directly to our stores for certain products. Our hubs and depots supply our stores via our fleet. In addition to in-store purchasing, Asda and Asda Logistics Services (“ALS”) also offer customers home-delivery and Click & Collect services. - _Hubs. Our two hubs are split by category: our Lutterworth hub handles general merchandise and ambient goods, while our Doncaster hub, which is operated by a third party, handles general merchandise and ambient products. - Suppliers. We work closely with over 5,900 active supplier accounts as of December 31, 2023. The top 20 of our goods for resale (“GFR”) suppliers (excluding IPL and fuel) reflected approximately 29.5% 182 ----- of cost of goods sold to GFR suppliers (excluding VAT, for the year ended December 31, 2023), while the top 20 goods not for resale (“GNFR”) suppliers (excluding IPL and fuel) reflected approximately 51.8% of costs of goods sold to GNFR suppliers. These suppliers deliver goods either to a hub (such as for ambient and non-edible products and non-food products), direct to depots (such as for fresh food, produce and fast-moving ambient) or direct to stores (such as for bread). New suppliers undergo a number of checks and procedures managed via the shared service centre team. If a supplier is identified as a third-party intermediary, which is typically only relevant to goods not for resale suppliers presenting a bribery and corruption risk, further procedures are required as part of the on-boarding and ongoing management processes for that supplier, focused on anti-corruption. During the on-boarding of goods not for resale suppliers, we undertake a compliance risk review covering topics including, among others, modern slavery, information security and privacy. If compliance risks are identified, then we agree on and implement appropriate mitigation measures. Relationships with goods for resale suppliers are managed by the relevant buying team within the commercial team. Our buyers are responsible for negotiating key terms, including pricing, promotional activity, supplier income arrangements, and payment terms. For goods not for resale suppliers, the applicable business owners manage the contract terms and arrangements. We leverage supplier relationships to deliver supply chain continuity. - Ordering process. The purchase order process varies according to the category of goods. - _GFR: Automatic orders are generated with suppliers based on stock levels / stock availability, historical demand trends and forecast trends. This is applicable for the majority of food orders. The supply team has manual override capabilities for automatic orders, albeit limited and rarely required. Non-food products typically operate on a longer lead time. The orders are based on forecast sales numbers provided to the supply team by the buying team and the commercial finance team. - _GFNR: Purchase orders are raised by the procurement team or the applicable colleague and reviewed by the budget holder (the individual who is responsible for the budget to which the associated cost relates) within that colleague’s team. - _Logistics facilities. Logistics facilities receive, process, warehouse and distribute goods for sale at our stores. IPL, Forza and Kober are treated as suppliers and largely deliver to depots. In addition, we operate home shopping centres, which are fulfilment centres for online grocery orders. - Fleet. Our drivers deliver goods to stores and customers using fleet vehicles (1,367 leased tractors and 2,629 leased trailers), home shopping vans (3,401 leased vans) or occasional spot hire or use of thirdparty hauliers (figures as of December 31, 2023). - Stores. aside from in-store purchasing, we also offer our customers home delivery and Click & Collect service. **IPL** We believe we have a competitive advantage in food sourcing via IPL and its two subsidiary companies, Forza and Kober, which enables a vertically integrated approach to procurement. IPL is an important asset that provides valuable sourcing differentiation. In 2023, £1,724 million was purchased through IPL, reducing our overall purchasing costs and delivering strong value to our customers. Our 2023 product mix sourced from IPL was 55.7% produce, 28.3% protein, 6.6% house plants and flowers, 6.1% beverages and 3.3% grocery. IPL employed over 3,700 colleagues as of December 31, 2023 across its group of companies, and only serves us. IPL receives products directly from producers and employs centralised sourcing, transportation and packing. This disintermediation of export agents, import agencies, suppliers and packers is the foundation of IPL’s cost price advantage: IPL sources fruit and vegetables, cooked meats, wine, nuts and dried fruit, plants and flowers and has a national footprint of nine processing facilities across the United Kingdom, supported by two overseas technical/logistical operations. IPL’s overseas offices provide us with the benefit of being close to our foreign grower partners, which we believe gives us greater insight and control over our supply chain, conferring on 183 ----- us a competitive advantage versus other retailers who do not benefit from comparable vertically integrated procurement. The map below shows IPL’s UK footprint. _(Source: Asda information.)_ IPL operates with five trading business units including produce (sourcing whole fruit and vegetables, potatoes and onions), protein (sourcing cooked meat and bacon), house plants and flowers (sourcing plants for the home and flowers), beverages (sourcing wine), grocery (sourcing snack nuts, desserts and baking products, cereal and other nuts and dried fruit), and with central functions to support these trading business units (by employing colleagues across IT, finance, legal and compliance and HR functions). The key countries of origin from which we source products via IPL include the United Kingdom, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and other European Union countries, Morocco, South Africa, Peru, Thailand and Egypt.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.21,"Our Quality Control System, Health and Safety and Environmental Policies",18.21.1,Quality Control,"We are committed to providing customers with safe and high-quality products, including both our own-brand products and name brand products. We have a due diligence framework in place which covers, among other things, our supplier audit framework, our governance policies, product testing and our specification management system. Our supplier audit framework measures compliance, supplier performance against food safety hazard analysis and critical control point principles. In addition, we have a quality management system that measures how our products perform in terms of quality. To control the quality of the products we sell, we execute a number of quality control initiatives. We conduct regular quality controls on the acceptance of fresh food at our depots. In addition, we analyse own-brand product 184 ----- samples in our in-house sensory kitchens and through a third-party, Cambridge Market Research, to ensure that our products meet our customers’ expectations. All new own-brand suppliers must be Global Food Safety Initiative accredited and must pass a new supplier audit before proceeding. In addition, all own-brand suppliers will have an annual unannounced Asda Star Audit that measures their adherence to Asda policy. We conduct food safety audits twice a year at our superstores and home shopping centres, and once a year at our smaller supermarkets and depots, to ensure that each site meets our required standards for food safety and hygiene. We conduct essential training and department-specific training for store colleagues to ensure that they are trained in all relevant aspects of food safety related to their department, including allergen management. When deciding whether to work with an own-brand supplier, we monitor the quality of its products based on a control of samples delivered by the supplier during the selection phase. Following selection, we regularly evaluate the quality of the products the supplier offers, including through randomly selected samples. Our general supplier terms and conditions include a section dedicated to quality, safety, labelling and traceability. By signing these terms and conditions, our suppliers confirm that they are fully aware of, and comply with, our safety and quality standards. Furthermore, suppliers must adhere to our technical manufacturing guide and associated policies for food as well as work with our own-brand technical teams to ensure compliance with this guide and these policies.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.21,"Our Quality Control System, Health and Safety and Environmental Policies",18.21.2,"Health, Safety and Environmental Policies and Ethics","We are committed to maintaining high standards of health and safety practices for our colleagues, customers, visitors, contractors and anyone affected by our business activities. We therefore consider good health, safety and environmental management as an essential part of our business performance and culture. We formally monitor health and safety incident rates. Our health and safety policies and procedures include: - managing risk and promoting a corporate culture that emphasises the benefits of health and safety; - appropriate training and education of all colleagues to support legal compliance and best practices; and - proactively conducting regular risk assessments and root cause analyses to provide and maintain safe and healthy working environments to significantly reduce occupational injuries or illnesses. We carry out a range of monitoring activities to provide assurance of the effectiveness of our policies and procedures. These activities are completed by both internal teams and external experts. We have a wide variety of health and safety and ethics policies that address topics such as Food Safety, Food Contamination, Warehouse Safety, Product Safety, Fire Safety, Privacy, Environment and Environmental Services, Anti-Money Laundering and Licences and Permits, among others. We also have a number of policies that relate specifically to waste management issues, such as Food and Drink Waste, Confidential Waste, Optical Waste and Pharmacy Waste.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.21,"Our Quality Control System, Health and Safety and Environmental Policies",18.21.3,"Our Environmental, Social and Governance Goals","As a major retailer, we believe that we have the ability, and the responsibility, to make a significant impact on the topics that matter to our stakeholders, such as energy and climate change, food waste, plastic and packaging, healthy and sustainable choices and the support of local communities (together, our “ESG Priority Areas”), and our customers want us to play our part in creating solutions that work for everyone. By taking action, we intend to meet these expectations, but also to strengthen our business for the future so that we can continue to deliver the same value to our customers. In 2022, we reassessed our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) programme to ensure it remains a critical pillar of our growth strategy. Our overarching ESG approach remains focused on providing access and affordability for customers as the business undergoes a period of transformation and takes account of the external environment in which we operate. 185 ----- In October 2023, we received our first external assessment of our ESG strategy with an overall rating of 3 (on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is the strongest) by the financial services ratings’ agency Sustainable Fitch as part of our ongoing commitment to transparently report on our efforts to achieve our ESG targets. We also received an entity score of 54 (on a scale of 0 to 100). _Our ESG Priority Areas Energy and Climate Change Mitigation Carbon Emissions_ Our carbon footprint is nearly equally split between the transportation of goods and refrigerants and natural gas (Scope 1 emissions) and the electricity we use across our estate (Scope 2 emissions). Our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions come from fleet, buildings and purchased energy, and we have undertaken numerous activities to reduce these, including through continuing to rollout gas-powered HGVs, electrifying the Asda Online delivery fleet and moving to lower-carbon refrigerants. For Scope 3 emissions, we continue to engage with our suppliers to reduce product-related emissions and work particularly closely with our largest suppliers on setting climate commitments for the products they sell us. To play our part in tackling climate change, we have been working to decarbonise our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions since 2007 and in 2015, set our commitment to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 50% by 2025. We have since reduced our greenhouse gas footprint for the United Kingdom by 41% to 564,247 tonnes CO2 equivalent (“tCO2e”) in 2023 (without giving effect to the Arthur Acquisition) compared to our baseline of 957,918 tCO2e in 2015. This reduction has been driven in part by a reduction in electricity and gas use, the continued transition of our heavy goods vehicles fleet to low or no carbon fuels and implementing lower carbon refrigeration and energy efficiency measures across our stores. In addition, in 2021 we stated our ambition to be a net-zero business, establishing a clear roadmap to achieving net-zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions within our own operations by 2040. We have committed to setting a near-term science-based carbon reduction target, including a specific Forests, Land and Agriculture target. These targets have been submitted to the Science-Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”) for validation. The proposed targets were submitted before the Arthur Acquisition and the EG UK Acquisition so reflect our footprint prior to these acquisitions. In 2024, we will look to incorporate these acquisitions into our baseline and targets. In 2022, our total carbon footprint was 28,295,682 tCO2e (without giving effect to the Arthur Acquisition) including 51% from product emissions (including the farming of ingredients, processing products, through to packaging), 2% in connection with supply chain logistics, 2% from our sites and fleet, 4% from goods not for resale as well as our operational activity, 25% from customers using the fuel we sell them and the remaining 16% from customers using products (including cooking, washing clothes, disposing of products and packaging). _Nature_ Food production systems require a diverse range of plants, animals, bacteria and fungi, both for the direct supply of food and to sustain the underlying ecosystem processes that make agriculture possible – from water supply to soil fertility enhancement, pollination and natural pest control. We are mindful of the impact we have through our value chain on the natural capitals of air, water, soil and biodiversity, and are committed to working in partnership to better respect and restore nature. In recent years, we have encouraged farmers to keep soil covered and improve biodiversity and soil structure through the use of our bespoke seed mixture. These seeds create a wildlife habitat during the late spring and summer and the wildlife corridors can also be used as buffer strips to watercourses. We are committed to more sustainably sourcing key commodities and tracking performance against our most material impacts, including soy and palm, within our annual ESG Report. We support the principles of Integrated Farm Management (“IFM”) and, in early 2023, we committed to obtaining the global LEAF Marque Environmental Assurance System across all our fresh produce by the end of 2025. 186 ----- _Water Resources_ Water resources are under stress around the world, and we believe improving water use and building resilience in global supply chains is vital in order to sustainably feed a growing population with healthy and affordable products. In 2022, 22% of our fruit and vegetables were imported from Southern Spain. As part of a cross-industry group working with the British Waste & Resources Action Programme (“WRAP”), we have made a three-year commitment for funding to the ‘Water Stewardship in South Spain’ project, which is taking action to try to reduce water-related risks in the fruit and vegetable production areas of Andalusia, Murcia and Valencia. In addition, we work with many garment manufacturers who have taken a series of water saving measures to reduce water consumption such as using harvested/reused water for flushing toilets and excess steam pipe water being returned to the boiler for reuse. _Waste Food Waste_ We are committed to being a zero-waste business, which means that any waste we do generate is either reused, recycled or redistributed. We continue to work towards our 2025 waste reduction targets across food (20% reduction in waste), packaging (100% recyclable own brand packaging, 30% recycled content) and operational waste (90% diversion from energy and maintain zero to landfill). As part of our efforts to reduce food surplus, we created a new team dedicated to reducing food waste within our supply chain in 2019. This team scrutinises our food waste performance by individual product line, enabling us to create initiatives and to work with our suppliers to reduce food waste. As a result, we removed best before dates on almost 250 fresh fruit and vegetable products to help customers reduce food waste in the home and save money in 2022 and, in early 2023, we went further by changing the use by dates on over half of our own brand yoghurts to a best before date, aiming to reduce the volume of edible yoghurt thrown away each year (by all retailers). In 2022, we processed 32,923 tonnes of food surplus (redistribution/animal feed) and food waste (anaerobic digestion/energy from waste) from our stores and depots. Whilst our priority is to reduce the absolute volume of our food surplus being processed as waste, we are also committed to ensuring that we handle that surplus in the most value-adding way possible by directing as much as possible for human or animal consumption. To tackle operational food waste, we increased the number of charities we work with redistributing surplus food from our distribution sites and through our partnerships in 2022, our stores, depots and home offices donated 2,182 tonnes of food, the equivalent of more than 5.2 million meals. In addition to our Food Waster prevention efforts, we began working with our clothing factories and George Home suppliers to help us build a robust strategy and policy around waste, which we plan to report through our future ESG reports and our website. _Plastic and Packaging_ Although packaging plays a vital role in protecting goods and keeping food fresh for as long as possible, consumers increasingly want to see fewer single-use plastics, especially when it comes to fresh produce. Where packaging is vital, we are working to make it more sustainable. Removing packaging completely or shrinking it down to its lightest possible weight has allowed us to remove significant amounts of plastic from Asda Brand products and eliminate some types of single-use plastic products from our stores and offices completely. Where packaging cannot be reduced, we are working to make it more reusable. We introduced reusable or re-tillable solutions for packaging that allowed a shift towards fresh meat and produce being transited in reusable crates and introduced customer refills at our Middleton “sustainability store,” which is a concept designed to encourage customers to reuse and refill their products, allowing customers to bring and fill their own containers with products such as on core products such as cereals, tea, coffee and pet food. We have partnered with Unilever and WRAP to conduct research to make the refill experience easier and more enjoyable for our customers. 187 ----- Where packaging cannot be reused, we are working to make it more recyclable. _Healthy, Sustainable Choices_ At Asda, we are making nutritious food affordable and appealing, with health-focused communications, support for public health campaigns and innovation in our own-brand products. We recognise the importance of front-of-pack traffic lights to enable customers to manage their calorie intake and their intakes of nutrients of concern such as fat, saturated fat, sugar and salt. In October 2022, location restrictions on the sale of high fat, salt and sugar foods (“HFSS”) came into force in England across 13 categories, a measure which forms a key part of the UK Government’s strategy to tackle obesity by making unhealthy food less prominent in stores and online. Despite the operational challenges affecting the way foods in Asda are merchandised and the significant investment required, we used the HFSS legislation to accelerate our ability to collect HFSS data across brands for all products, which is essential to be able to report on healthy basket spend. We also recognise the importance of highlighting healthy choices to our customers with a focus on positive nutrients and health benefits, which is the motivation behind our 2020 launch of the Asda Live Better icon, which highlights the healthiest choices in our own-brand ranges. In the fourth quarter of 2023, approximately 876 products, including a wide range from the Just Essentials by Asda, bore the icon and we aim to have 1,200 products in the range by the end of 2024. _Supporting Local Communities Fundraising and Support_ We aim to build stronger communities and to connect others to make a collective impact on our customers. Through our network of Community Champions and fundraising initiatives, we take action to make a positive change to poverty, tackle breast cancer, support children and families in crisis and build more resilient communities. The Asda Foundation is an independent charity with more than 30 years’ of history helping people in local communities. Its mission is to transform communities and improve lives throughout the United Kingdom, complementing Asda’s ambition to be at the heart of local communities. The Asda Foundation supports grassroots organisations as well as local communities in emergencies, reacting quickly to help people in the immediate hours following a disaster. The Asda Foundation provides grants to small, local activities, funding a wide range of projects from school uniforms and Christmas lunches to refurbishing a community centre kitchen. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Asda and the Asda Foundation pledged £1.0 million to support displaced Ukrainian families in Europe and the United Kingdom and helped Ukrainian refugees by welcoming applications for roles in our stores, warehouses and within IPL, with a guaranteed job interview and specialist support for those recruited. The increasing cost of living is a growing issue in the United Kingdom and in 2022, Asda Foundation introduced a new Cost of Living grant to support local groups with increased running costs. In 2022 Asda Foundation invested £4,315,444 in local communities, supporting 7,119 groups with grants and colleague hardship payments. Over 14 million people in the United Kingdom live below the poverty line, and just under a third of those affected are children. At the same time, 4.4 million tonnes of edible food are wasted in the United Kingdom each year and as a food retailer, it is important to us to make a positive impact. Through its transformational three-year, Fight Hunger, Create Change programme, Asda partnered with FareShare and The Trussell Trust to create long-term positive change in the United Kingdom. Asda has since continued to support both FareShare and the Trussell Trust through donations of food, cause-related marketing initiatives, customer fundraising and top up donations. _Diversity & Inclusion_ Our mission is to be the UK’s most trusted retailer, which means building a business that is diverse and inclusive, creating a safe and supportive environment for our colleagues, customers and suppliers. We focus on providing the best possible learning opportunities for our colleagues, listening to their needs and promoting their health and wellbeing and as further support, we launched a course called “Inclusion Matters” in 2022 to help 188 ----- colleagues build an inclusive work environment. We encourage everyone to be allies through positive and conscious efforts and introduced an “Asda Allies” campaign to raise awareness on how our colleagues can help under-represented colleagues and its importance. Asda Allies is a key lens for all our internal campaigns and underpins that one does not have to be directly affected by discrimination or unfair treatment to challenge non-inclusive behaviour, advocate the need for change, and seek to understand the additional barriers that some people or communities face. We have set a target to increase the proportion of female store managers to 30% by 2025 and have established programmes to deliver this, such as our Retail Female Representation Working Group, which is tasked with looking at the barriers to increasing female store leadership and our Female Intentional Allyship programme that launched in 2022. In 2023, 290 of our colleagues participated in the Female Intentional Allyship programme. Over the years, we introduced 75 apprenticeship programmes, including degrees in data science, supply chain leadership and business management and were recognised in 2022 as one of the United Kingdom’s top 100 apprenticeship employers. In 2023, Asda was a finalist in the Macro Employer of the Year category of the National Apprenticeship Awards. _Supply Chain and Responsible Sourcing_ Ethics and compliance are at the heart of ensuring our business meets the expectations of our stakeholders in terms of conduct and behaviours. These behaviours and expectations extend to everyone who works with us, from our employees to our suppliers and contractors, requiring them to share our values and help promote a culture where people do the right thing as a matter of course. We have integrated supply chain policies into our processes and ways of working to obtain supply chain transparency and continue to work to ensure our supply chains are resilient and lead to positive change by sourcing responsibly, promoting human rights and eschewing modern slavery. Our Ethics and Compliance programme is designed to manage compliance risks with key areas relevant to the retail sectors including anti-corruption, anti-trust, consumer protection, environmental, anti-money laundering and financial services, food safety, health and safety, optical and pharmacy, labour and employment, licences and permits, privacy, product safety, responsible sourcing and trade sanctions. Since our separation from Walmart we have been transitioning to establish an Asda-specific approach to responsible sourcing and in 2022, we published our Human Rights Policy and completed a responsible sourcing risk assessment based on supplier compliance information to identify salient risks and themes including gender, modern slavery, vulnerable workers, worker representation and working hours as key topics to address and further integrate throughout our business.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

They provide management, analytical and performance evaluation tools that assist management at all levels to undertake business processes. Our technical infrastructure and computer applications are also used for the day-to-day management of our business, including purchasing, sourcing, distribution, online sales, data exploitation, invoicing, cash collection, reporting, consolidation and electronic data interchange.

Our information systems are highly integrated, covering most of our fundamental business service areas. The majority of our core systems are currently provided and managed by Walmart, and we are migrating off of these systems onto alternative solutions through Project Future. As of March 31, 2024, we have invested approximately £600 million in Project Future, comprising of both operating expenses and capital expenditure. We believe Project Future presents significant opportunities in terms of our efficiency, data capabilities, customer experience and competitive edge. We are in the third year of the four-year programme. We are progressing through the build and implement of Project Future, moving to in-depth testing and roll-out. We have successfully converted seven depots as of March 31, 2024 as part of our new Warehouse Management system “Manhattan” (with two more in progress) and have implemented our new store till systems across many stores. Our core back-office SAP system is also live, onto which we have recently transitioned our finance operations, and we are undertaking detailed testing to prepare for transitioning our commercial function to SAP in the second quarter of 2024.

There are also 8,147 claims filed in the High Court which are stayed pending the outcome of the Equal Value Claims. The claimants allege that the work performed by colleagues in Asda’s retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of colleagues working in Asda’s warehouse and distribution facilities, that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in Asda’s retail stores with those of colleagues in Asda’s warehouse and distribution facilities. On March 26, 2021, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, that the work of hourly-paid workers in distribution centres and the work of hourly-paid workers in stores can be compared. The litigation is currently in the equal value stage when the Employment Tribunal Claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by colleagues in Asda’s warehouse and distribution facilities. The equal value hearing is scheduled to take place from September 9, 2024 to December 13, 2024 at the Manchester Employment Tribunal. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and any losses that may arise from these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We believe we have substantial factual and legal defences to these claims and intend to defend the claims vigorously. Under a separate indemnity undertaking, Walmart has agreed to indemnify the LBO Purchaser in respect of a portion of costs and losses incurred by the Asda Group from Equal Value Claims filed with employment tribunals, up to an agreed cap. If the Asda Group is ultimately unsuccessful in defending any of the Equal Value Claims, we do not believe that such an outcome would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations nor our ability to meet our debt service obligations, including on the Senior Secured Notes, or other financial obligations as they become due. As of December 31, 2023, the Group had material off balance sheet arrangements or funding arrangements that would be classified as a contingent liability under UK IFRS with respect to the ongoing Equal Value Claims. Despite the above-mentioned Supreme Court ruling, the Group has not recognised a provision on the basis that any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings cannot be reasonably estimated and any potential liability is only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits.

Under the MIP, an intermediate holding company of the Group, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, has entered into an agreement with the holders of MIP management shares (“MIP scheme members”) whereby MIP scheme members are granted put options which, when exercised, enable them to sell their management shares to Bellis Midco 2 Limited or another non-Group entity for a value which is based on an independent valuation determined at the exercise date. MIP scheme members are required to be employed by the Group at the grant date of the MIP shares. If a member of the scheme ceases to be employed by the Group during the vesting period, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, a parent of Bellis Finco PLC, has the option to repurchase, or nominate another entity of the Group to repurchase, the shares during the 12-month period after the member’s leave date. As such, directors of the Group have determined that the MIP scheme falls within the scope of IFRS 2. The difference between the IFRS 2 fair value and the fair value paid by MIP scheme members at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period (i.e., the period from date on which the MIP shares are granted to the estimated exercise date) as an expense in the consolidated Income Statement. As neither MIP shares nor put options over MIP shares are issued by entities within the Group, and as there is no recharge agreement in place which requires any entity within the Group to settle liabilities in respect of MIP shares, changes in the fair value of MIP shares are accounted for on an equity-settled basis. 198 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

As a result of these discussions, the EG UK Acquisition was completed on October 31, 2023 for total cash consideration of £2.1 billion. On the EG UK Completion Date, EG Group (using EG Corporate Services Limited) entered into a transitional services agreement with Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited (together with its subsidiaries, the “Acquired EG UK Target",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The initial term of the EG TSA is for a period of up to two years from the EG UK Completion Date, subject to certain rights for the Acquired EG UK Target Group to terminate, or transition away from, services early or to extend the initial term for an aggregate period of up to a further 12 months (in 3 months increments). During the term of the EG TSA, EG will also provide certain of the IT services that will continue to be provided to the Acquired EG UK Target Group to Asda, for the benefit of certain other convenience retail sites that Asda and its affiliates own from time to time, including those branded as “Asda Express.” The services provided by EG to the Acquired EG UK Target Group will be deemed to be subject to a service credit for the first two years of the EG TSA, as a result of which the Acquired EG UK Target Group will not be required to make any payment to EG for the services (subject to certain limited exceptions) and thereafter will be provided for a fee based on the actual cost to EG of providing the services, plus an agreed margin that will be applied to any non-third party costs. The services provided to Asda in respect of convenience retail sites that are not part of the Acquired EG UK Target Group will be provided for a fee payable to EG based on the actual cost to EG of providing the services, plus an agreed margin that will be applied to non-third party costs. EG’s liability for provision of the services will be subject to limitations customary for an agreement of this nature, including an annual financial cap on EG’s liability of £12.2 million for most liabilities. In connection with such transitional arrangements, and as further consideration for the EG UK Acquisition, EG also agreed to cover certain other centralised costs, including redundancy costs, and integration costs during the transitional period. The EG Seller has provided certain guarantees in favour of entities transferred to Asda as part of the EG UK Acquisition, or to the Purchaser, in respect of the obligations of EG under: (i) the EG TSA; and (ii) certain business sale agreements entered into by certain transferred entities and members of EG in connection with reorganisations effected prior to completion of the EG UK Acquisition. On the EG UK Completion Date, the EG Seller and Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited also entered into a transitional brand licence agreement which took effect immediately following the EG UK Completion Date (the “EG Brand Licence Agreement”). Pursuant to the EG Brand Licence Agreement, EG granted the Acquired EG UK Target Group a non-exclusive right to use certain of EG’s brands, including the ‘EG’ and ‘Euro Garages’ brands, for a period of three years, royalty free, to allow the Acquired EG UK Target Group to rebrand its sites and businesses (subject to earlier termination rights). Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited will have a right to extend the term of the brand licence for a further two years, in increments of 12 months at a time, if it has not completed this debranding process by the end of the expiry of the initial three-year term, subject to the parties agreeing a royalty fee for the use of such brands during such extension. On May 30, 2023, the EG Seller, the America Purchaser and Asda Stores Limited entered into a side letter in connection with the electric vehicle charger business, which is part of EG’s retained UK&I business (the “EVPoint",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The scope of the TMA includes licences of the George, Scan & Go, Smart Price and Rollback trade marks, certain domain names, including George.com, as well as certain other Walmart-owned trade mark rights used by a member of the Asda Group between October 2019 and the LBO Acquisition Completion Date (the “Licensed IP”). The TMA permits Asda Stores Limited to sub-license the use of the Licensed IP to specified permitted sub-licensees, including members of the Asda Group, existing franchisees to which Asda Stores Limited has granted a licence of the Licensed IP under franchise agreements in place as at the date of the LBO Acquisition Agreement and certain specified companies that are also owned by the shareholders or funds managed by TDR Capital LLP, provided Walmart is given written notice and the sub-licence fulfils certain conditions, including that it is on terms that are no less onerous than the TMA. Additionally, Walmart cannot unreasonably withhold, delay or condition consent for Asda Stores Limited to sub-license the Licensed IP to certain other entities including those that are controlled by the shareholders of Asda Stores Limited’s ultimate holding company, provided that the sub-licence fulfils certain conditions, including that it is on terms no less onerous that the TMA. Manufacturing or packaging of goods bearing the Licensed IP may take place worldwide. The scope of the licence for sale, marketing and distribution purposes is the United Kingdom only (on an exclusive basis) and, for the George brand only, also specified countries in Europe as set out in the TMA (on a non-exclusive basis). These licences are perpetual and irrevocable, subject to the termination rights summarised below. The TMA includes a non-exclusive licence to use the George brand in substantially the same way as the brand was used immediately prior to the date of the LBO Acquisition Agreement in certain territories outside the United Kingdom and the specified European countries in which Asda Stores Limited has been selling George-branded goods under a specified third-party e-commerce fulfilment contract immediately prior to the date of the LBO Acquisition Agreement (the “George RoW",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Those agreements included, amongst others, a trade mark agreement (the “TMA”) and a transitional services agreement (the “TSA”) entered into between Asda Stores Limited and Walmart. The LBO Seller, the LBO Purchaser and Walmart (among others) further entered into a transitional pensions deed (the “TPD”).

All use of the Licensed IP (other than use of the George mark in the United Kingdom) is to be in the same,20.5.1,Transitional Services Agreement,"Under the TSA, Walmart provides certain information technology services to Asda Stores Limited on a transitional basis with effect from the LBO Acquisition Completion Date. The services comprise all information technology and telecommunications services (and related operational system processes) that Walmart Group Companies provided to the Asda Group in the 12 months prior to the LBO Acquisition Completion Date, and each such service is to be supplied by Walmart until the earlier of (i) migration of the relevant service as part of the separation of Asda Stores Limited from Walmart; and (ii) termination of the TSA in accordance with its terms by one of the parties (as summarised below). The services are arranged into six categories (referred to as “service towers,” which relate to stores, supply chain, merchandising, back office, e-commerce and infrastructure/security) for charging and migration purposes. Asda Stores Limited has the right to terminate any service tower, or the TSA in its entirety, on three months’ notice. In addition, either party has the right to terminate the TSA following the insolvency of its counterparty or a 207 ----- material breach of the terms of the TSA (subject to a notice requirement and a 30-day cure period, to the extent applicable). In addition, Asda Stores Limited has the right to request a “Change Freeze” which it did in respect of five of the six service towers from May 1, 2021, and in respect of the sixth tower (e-commerce) from 2023. This means that Asda ceases to benefit from changes and a change request service that it would otherwise receive on Walmart’s group operating model (this is not defined but really is benchmarked by the service Asda has received to date). From the freeze, Walmart has absolute discretion to reject any “Change Requests” made by Asda in relation to a “frozen” service tower unless that change relates to a “Mandatory Change” (i.e., a change in relevant Regulations or a change required for compliance or security reasons) or a usage change. The TSA includes customary warranties concerning the corporate existence and capacity of the parties and an undertaking to provide information and participate in discussions in connection with the delivery of the services. Walmart agrees to provide each service to a standard and in a manner that is consistent with Walmart’s provision of the equivalent service in the 12 months prior to the LBO Acquisition Completion Date. Walmart is not required to provide the services to, or to meet, any more onerous standard or service level. Walmart is required to use reasonable endeavours to obtain and maintain third-party consents that are required for the provision of the services. Where a third-party consent is not obtained or maintained, Walmart is not required to provide the relevant service (and the TSA will terminate in respect of the relevant service without liability on the part of Walmart) and the parties will work together to agree a workaround (including replacement, in-sourcing or early migration) in order to enable Asda Stores Limited to continue to receive the benefit of the affected service. All reasonable one-off or ongoing costs of obtaining and maintaining third-party consents or implementing workarounds are to be borne by Asda Stores Limited, subject to Walmart consulting with Asda Stores Limited before incurring these costs. Asda Stores Limited and Walmart have a separation plan in place and the separation costs (excluding internal costs of the Walmart Group) are borne by Asda Stores Limited. The charges for the TSA services for the first year following the LBO Acquisition Completion Date were initially capped at £142 million (excluding any VAT), and the cap on service charges subsequently rises by 1% per year thereafter. The charges payable for services in subsequent years are equal to the charges for such services for the previous contract year (subject to any reduction as summarised below) subject to an inflationary increase of 2% per year. The charges per service tower are split on a fixed cost and variable cost basis. The variable proportion of the charges reduce to the extent that Asda Stores Limited is able to achieve certain agreed milestones in its separation plan and ramp down usage of the relevant service tower. The initial terms of the TSA stated that for any service to be provided beyond a long stop date of three years from the LBO Acquisition Completion Date, being February 2024, the charges for any remaining services will ratchet up by 10% every six months (the “TSA Ratchet”). However, we have received a deferral of the TSA Ratchet until February 16, 2025. If we have not substantially completed Project Future by February 16, 2025, Walmart may be entitled to back-charge us any TSA Ratchet payments that would have been due under the original terms of the TSA after February 2024. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our _Acquisitions—Delays in our ability to separate from Walmart could result in significant cost and any issues with the separation process, particularly system cutovers, could significantly disrupt business operations and impact our ability to meet our strategic objectives.”_ The liability of the parties under the TSA is limited, where service-specific, to the amount of fees paid or payable in respect of the relevant service tower during the relevant contract year. In the case of liabilities that are not related to a specific service tower, the liability of the parties under the TSA is limited to the total amount of fees paid or payable during the relevant contract year. Each party’s aggregate liability for each contract year is limited to the amount of fees paid or payable during the relevant contract year. These limitations are subject to limited exceptions, including in the case of fraud. Neither party is liable for any indirect or consequential losses or loss of profit or loss of revenue and, to the extent Walmart’s breach is caused by a third-party default, Walmart’s maximum liability to Asda Stores Limited is limited to the amount that Walmart can recover from the third party (or an equitable proportion thereof to reflect the loss suffered by the Asda Group as compared to the Walmart Group). Walmart is not liable to Asda Stores Limited to the extent the relevant liability is caused by a failure on the part of the Asda Group to perform its obligations under the TSA. 208 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Walmart is party to the TPD and guarantees the obligations of the LBO Seller in respect of this indemnity. The LBO Purchaser and Bellis TopCo Limited indemnify Asda and Walmart in respect of any losses incurred by either of them in respect of the Asda Group Pension Scheme if the losses arise from, broadly, a voluntary act by Bellis TopCo Limited (or any other affiliate of Bellis TopCo Limited), including failure by Asda to comply with its obligations under the documentation governing the Asda Group Pension Scheme Buy-In. Liability under both indemnity arrangements terminates on the later of: (i) three years after completion of the buyout of the Asda Group Pension Scheme; (ii) the date of completion of the winding-up of the Asda Group Pension Scheme; or (iii) (in respect of losses relate to tax only) five years after the LBO Acquisition Completion Date. As part of the arrangements in respect of the buy-in of the Asda Group Pension Scheme Asda Stores Limited agreed to make a loan facility available to the trustees of the Asda Group Pension Scheme. Under the TPD, in the event that a funding obligation arises under the loan facility which Asda is unable to satisfy, Walmart Inc agrees to use reasonable endeavours to provide short-term funding to Asda to allow Asda to meet the funding obligation. A buy-out of the Asda Group Pension Scheme was executed on July 9, 2021 which extinguished the Group’s responsibility to fund the Asda Group Pension Scheme as sponsoring employer.

These covenants include not committing or knowingly omitting acts which would bring the Licensed IP into disrepute or damage, or weaken or be detrimental to the Licensed IP in any material respect.

In particular, references to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 have been removed as the act is not applicable in Scotland, meaning that the Tenant has no statutory right to renew. o The renewal option in the England & Wales leases is amended to a lease extension option under the Scottish leases (for the same term and on the same notice as under the England & Wales leases). o The assignment condition is amended to remove the option for the current Tenant to provide an authorised guarantee agreement and all other references to authorised guarantee agreement as authorised guarantee agreements are not applicable in Scotland. - The underletting provisions are amended to remove requirements on the undertenant to enter into deeds of covenant directly with the landlord. In respect of the Warehouse Asset at Grangemouth, a £1 rent lease has also been entered into on terms substantially similar to the Warehouse Asset Leases (but excluding all provisions in relation to insurance, rent review and environmental matters, and with bespoke (more restrictive) provisions in relation to repair, alterations, yield up and alienation), subject to the terms of the lease under which the aforementioned separate leasehold interest is held, to demise certain land used by this Warehouse Asset but held as a separate leasehold interest and for the purposes of laying and retaining a pipeline with ancillary connections for the purposes of discharging surface water from the Warehouse Asset to the waste water network. The £1 lease is linked to the main Warehouse Asset Lease at Grangemouth insofar as the £1 lease must only be assigned, sublet and charged simultaneously with (and to the same assignee or sublessee as) the main Warehouse Asset Lease, and the £1 lease will terminate at the same time as the main Warehouse Asset Lease. The Tenant under the £1 lease must pay the service charge payable under the relevant headlease and must observe the tenant’s obligations under such headlease (other than to pay rents) and not do anything which would put the landlord in breach of its obligations under such headlease. - The Asda Group has retained ownership to the Select Retail Assets (save for in respect of the Shaw Oldham store which was included in the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction) and the Substitute Retail Assets (save for in respect of the Canterbury and Boldon sites which were included in the 2023 Ground Rent Transaction). - The Lutterworth CDC Warehouse Asset Lease contains bespoke additional obligations on the Tenant, being (i) an obligation to pay a service charge (being such amount payable by the landlord under the superior lease); (ii) not to apply for planning permission in relation to alterations, unless the works would not trigger an overage under the HCA Deed (undefined), or unless the tenant has agreed to pay such overage; and (iii) to be liable for any environmental liability in relation to a leakage of fuel from the Diesel UST tank in the north east of the premises which was decommissioned in or about 2015. The Lutterworth CDC, Lutterworth IDC, Washington ADC and Doncaster GM Warehouse Asset Leases contain obligations to comply with all tenant covenants in the relevant headlease (other than to pay rents) and additional provisions in relation to circumstances in which superior landlord consent is required. The Lutterworth IDC Warehouse Asset Lease also contains an obligation to pay a service charge, being such amount payable by the landlord under the superior lease. 256 ----- The Doncaster GM Warehouse Asset Lease contains a bespoke obligation on the Tenant to pay a service charge, being such amount as the landlord is liable to pay under the superior lease on maintenance of the Redhouse Interchange estate. The Tenant’s obligation to insure under the Doncaster GM Warehouse Asset Lease is also subject to the superior landlord having consented to the tenant insuring. The Wakefield ASC and CDC Warehouse Asset Leases contain bespoke provisions in relation to a right of way in favour of the Wakefield ASC premises over the Wakefield CDC premises. The Erith CDC and Bedford CDC Warehouse Asset Leases both contain a bespoke obligation on the Tenant to pay a service charge (being such amount payable by the landlord under 2004 transfer documents in relation to the Erith CDC lease and under a 2022 deed in relation to the Bedford CDC lease). The Bedford ASC Warehouse Asset Lease contains an obligation to pay proper costs incurred by the landlord in relation to contributions under a 1997 conveyance and 2005 transfer. The Didcot ADC Warehouse Asset Lease contains an obligation on the Tenant to pay a service charge, being such amount as the landlord is liable to pay under a 2004 transfer document. The Warrington (Omega South) ADC Warehouse Asset Lease contains bespoke obligations on the Tenant, being an obligation to pay any service charge under a deed entered into with the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) in 2013, as well as any overage which becomes due as a result of an act of the Tenant (or associated / group company or person) under such deed. Similarly, the Washington ASC Warehouse Asset Lease contains obligations to pay any overage which becomes due as a result of an act of the Tenant (or associated / group company or person) under a deed entered into with the HCA in 2008. The Tenant under both aforementioned Warehouse Asset Leases is also prevented from making any change of use or applying for planning permission for alterations which would cause an overage to be payable under the relevant HCA deed. The Site A Falkirk Warehouse Asset Lease contains a bespoke obligation on the Tenant to pay a service charge, being such amount as the landlord is liable to pay under deed of condition registered in the Land Register of Scotland under Title Number STG53196 on August 28, 2019. The IPL Westry Warehouse Asset Lease states that no title guarantee is given in relation to one of the titles out of which part of the IPL Westry Warehouse Asset Lease is granted (being title number CB395942, which is a possessory freehold title). This part of the demise of the IPL Westry Warehouse Asset Lease is a small piece of boundary land. The Chepstow ADC Warehouse Asset Lease contains a bespoke obligation on the Tenant to pay (1) any overage and other sums which become due (including indemnifying the landlord against the same) pursuant to a 1999 transfer; and (2) a service charge payable under transfers dated May 27, 1999.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

In addition, each Master Lease contains two (2) renewal options (or in relation to the SLB Master Leases of the Scottish assets an option to extend) for a term of ten (10) years each which can be exercised during the term of each of the SLB Master Leases (and subsequent first renewal or extension lease) but not less than six (6) months’ prior to expiry of the term of each of the SLB Master Leases (and subsequent first renewal or extension lease). _Rent_ The SLB Master Leases each reserve a different rent payable by the Tenant in equal instalments on February 28, May 31, August 31 and November 30 in each year. The rent is subject to an annual review which is upwards-only, linked to the percentage change in Consumer Price Index for the period from the immediately preceding rent review date to the current rent review date subject to a cap of 4% and a collar of 1%. Interest is payable at 3% per annum above the Barclays base rate on any sums (including but not limited to rent) not paid by the Tenant on the date they are due. The Tenant is also required to pay all outgoings (including but not limited to business rates, taxes and utilities) and landlord fees. _Landlord and Tenant Act 1954_ In addition to the contractual options to extend the SLB Master Leases, the SLB Master benefit from a Tenant statutory right of renewal pursuant to the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (not applicable for the Master Leases of the Scottish assets). The Tenant has a right to renew the SLB Master Leases in England & Wales at the end of the term, subject to some limited grounds of opposition available to the landlord pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. _Guarantor_ There is no guarantor party to the SLB Master Leases in respect of the Tenant’s obligations. _Use_ The Tenant may only use the SLB Properties as (1) retail stores within Class E of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (and certain specified ancillary uses to such use); (2) any use to which the SLB Properties were used as at the date of the relevant Master Lease; and (3) any other use approved by the landlord (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed where the proposed use would not have a material adverse effect on the value of the landlord’s interest). The Tenant may also permit undertenants to use a part of the premises for any lawful use within Class E or various uses within Class F, provided that such uses within Class F are limited to a maximum aggregate area of 5% of the gross internal area of the buildings on the premises. 258 ----- _Maintenance, Alterations and Expansion_ Pursuant to the SLB Master Leases, the Tenant is obligated to repair, replace and maintain each SLB Property. The Tenant may make de minimis alterations (which include both non-structural and specific minor structural alterations such as creation of new entrances and exterior canopies and internal division walls required for subletting) subject to various conditions, including but not limited to (i) obtaining any planning permissions; (ii) giving the insurers of the relevant SLB Property notice of the work; (iii) procuring that the works are carried out by reputable contractors in a good and workmanlike manner; (iv) making good any defects arising out of the works; and (v) giving the landlord records in line with CDM regulations and drawings of alterations). The Tenant may make minor alterations (which include structural alterations which do not increase the gross external area of buildings on the premises by more than 40%) subject to the above conditions, as well as subject to supplying the landlord full written details of the proposed alterations and confirmation that such alterations are not part of a wider scheme of works and that all requisite consents have been or will be obtained. The Tenant may make major alterations (being any alterations or any structural additions to the properties that are not minor alterations or de minimis alterations) subject to the conditions which apply to minor alterations as well as subject to receiving landlord consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. The Tenant must also procure warranties in favour of the landlord (to the extent the Tenant has the ability to call for such warranties) for major alterations or minor alterations where new buildings / extensions are erected. There are various restrictions on all alterations to the premises, including, but not limited to, not making any alterations which would (i) prejudice the structural integrity of the premises; (ii) lower the energy performance rating of the premises; or (iii) have a material detrimental effect on the value of the landlord’s interest. _Yield Up_ The Tenant is required to return the SLB Properties at the expiry of the term having removed all fixtures and signage installed by the Tenant, as well as any alterations made during the term, except that the Tenant shall not be required to remove buildings or permanent structures if their continued presence beyond the end of the Term would not have a material detrimental effect on the estimated rental value of the landlord’s reversionary interest in the relevant SLB Property or the Tenant (in its discretion) elects instead to pay a sum equivalent to the detrimental effect on the estimated rental value of the landlord’s reversionary interest. Any alterations which have not been completed at the end of the term must be reinstated to the landlord’s reasonable satisfaction. The Tenant must also return the SLB Properties free from any underleases, concessions and third-party rights of occupation created by the Tenant other than those where the landlord consented expressly to such occupier remaining after the expiry of the term. _Tenant’s right of First Offer_ In the event that the landlord, whether or not for money or money’s worth, wishes to sell or exchanges their reversionary interest in any of the SLB Properties (whether in part or in whole) or grant a lease or agreement for lease in respect of any of the SLB Properties (whether in part or in whole) at a premium or with the intention or effect of realising capital value from any of the SLB Properties to a third party, the landlord must first offer to sell the relevant SLB Property which is the subject matter of the proposed disposal to the Tenant, being Asda Stores Limited or any group company (the right of first offer is personal to the original tenant and its group companies). The right of first offer is conditioned upon there being no event of default that would give rise to a right for the landlord to forfeit the Master Lease then occurring under the subject Master Lease. _Assignment_ The SLB Master Leases contain assignment and subletting rights in favour the Tenant. The Tenant may assign (in whole only) or sublet (in whole or in part) the Master Lease of the relevant SLB Property subject to landlord consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The landlord may impose certain conditions in respect of giving consent to an assignment. The landlord may impose that (i) the proposed assignee enters into a deed of covenant with the landlord to comply with the terms of the 259 ----- Master Lease; (ii) there are no arrears of rents due to the landlord that are not the subject of a legitimate dispute about their payment; and (iii) the proposed assignee either (a) where it is in a group of companies which owns or controls a brand which is ranked as being in the top four grocery retailers in Great Britain by Kantar Group, has a financial strength rating of at least either (A) B by Standard and Poor’s; (B) B2 by Moody’s or (C) B by Fitch (or a reasonably equivalent rating from a successor rating business or alternative major rating agency acceptable to the landlord), or (b) where it is not in a group of companies which owns or controls a brand in the top four grocery retailers, has a financial strength rating of at least (A) BBB- by Standard and Poor’s; (B) Baa3 by Moody’s; or (C) BBB- by Fitch (or a reasonably equivalent rating from a successor rating business or alternative major rating agency acceptable to the landlord); or, in relation to both the foregoing (a) and (b), where the proposed assignee does not have such a rating, it obtains a shadow rating from one of these agencies which would otherwise satisfy the above criteria (the “Rating",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Alternatively, where the Tenant or any guarantor meets the Rating Criteria, the tenant or such guarantor",136.42.1,SLB Properties – site-specific provisions,"Transaction documentation for certain of the SLB Properties differs from those master transaction document templates which are described in the section above. This sub-section briefly sets out any such material differences on a site-by-site basis. - **Blackpool: the Master Lease for the store in Blackpool contains bespoke insurance and alterations provisions due to certain third-party restrictive covenants registered on the title of the Blackpool store. Accordingly, insurance is in place covering the risk of breach or enforcement of these third-party restrictive covenants. As a consequence, if alterations or implementing or applying for planning permission would fall foul of the exclusions within the title insurance policy, the Tenant is required to either (i) seek consent from the insurer and confirmation from the insurer that the title insurance cover will continue notwithstanding the alteration or implementation of planning permission, or (ii) obtain a new title insurance policy covering the same third party restrictive covenant risks and which would not be voided by the aforementioned alterations or application for or implementation of any planning permission. The Tenant was also required to enter into a deed of covenant at the date of the lease to comply with various obligations contained in a 2015 transfer. The Tenant cannot assign the Blackpool Master Lease unless the assignee enters into a deed of covenant on the same terms. - **Bolton: the Master Lease for the store in Bolton contains bespoke insurance and alterations provisions due to the fact that several car parking spaces may encroach on land which is not owned by the landlord (which the tenant acknowledges under the terms of the Master Lease and confirms that it will not be entitled to claim in respect of derogation from grant in relation to such gap). Accordingly, insurance is in place covering the risk of the owner of the relevant land claiming ownership or bringing a claim for damages. As a consequence, if alterations or implementing or applying for planning permission would fall foul of the exclusions within the title insurance policy, the Tenant is required to either (i) seek consent from the insurer and confirmation from the insurer that the title insurance cover will continue notwithstanding the alteration or implementation of planning permission, or (ii) obtain a new title insurance policy covering the same risk and which would not be voided by the aforementioned alterations or application for or implementation of any planning permission. - **Frome: McLagan Investments Limited has retained a large nature reserve at the Frome property. The Master Lease for the Frome property allows Asda Stores Limited or any group company (being any company or companies which is and/or are for the time being a member of the same group of companies as the Tenant within the meaning of Section 42(1) of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954) to use parking at the Frome property for visitors to the neighbouring nature reserve retained by McLagan Investments Limited. - **Glasshoughton: the Master Lease for the store in Glasshoughton contains bespoke insurance and alterations provisions due to the fact that part of the land is unregistered. Accordingly, the landlord only leases the unregistered land with such right, title and interest as the landlord has in the premises as at the date of the Master Lease (rather than with full title guarantee), and title insurance is in place to cover the risk of a third party claiming ownership of the unregistered land. As a consequence, if alterations or implementing or applying for planning permission would fall foul of the exclusions within the title insurance policy, the Tenant is required to either (i) seek consent from the insurer and confirmation from the insurer that the title insurance cover will continue notwithstanding the alteration or implementation of planning permission, or (ii) obtain a new title insurance policy covering the same risk and which would not be voided by the aforementioned alterations or application for or implementation of any planning permission. - **Kings Hill: the Master Lease for the store in Kings Hill contains bespoke service charge provisions due to the fact that there is an estate service charge payable to a third-party estate management company by the landlord. The Tenant is required to pay any such service charge to the landlord within twenty (20) working days of written demand. The Tenant was also required to enter into a deed of covenant at the date of the lease to comply with various obligations contained in various transfers dated 2004 and 2013 and to create various new restrictive covenants over the premises. The Tenant also entered into a separate deed of covenant to pay estate charges and comply with various additional covenants. The Tenant cannot assign the Kings Hill Master Lease unless the assignee enters into deeds of covenant on the same terms. 263 ----- - **Leicester: the Master Lease for the store in Leicester contains an acknowledgement by the Tenant that there may be a gap between the north western boundary of the property and the adopted highway and that the Tenant will not be entitled to claim in respect of derogation from grant in relation to such gap. - **Poole: the Master Lease for the store in Poole is an underlease and therefore contains additional obligations on the Tenant to comply with all tenant covenants in the headlease insofar as they relate to the Poole store (other than to pay rents) and additional provisions in relation to circumstances in which superior landlord consent is required. The Master Lease permits the use of certain parts of the property to be used for residential use. - **Swindon Haydon: the Master Lease for the store in Swindon Haydon contains bespoke service charge provisions due to the fact that there is an estate service charge payable to a third-party estate management company by the landlord (where is it not paid direct to the third party estate management company by the Tenant). The Tenant is required to pay any such service charge to the landlord within twenty (20) working days of written demand. - **Wolverhampton: the Master Lease for the store in Wolverhampton contains bespoke insurance and alterations provisions due to the fact that part of the land was unregistered at the time the lease was entered into. Accordingly, insurance was put in place covering the risk of a third party claiming ownership of the unregistered land and provisions were inserted in the lease stating that if the tenant’s alterations or implementing or applying for planning permission would fall foul of the exclusions within the title insurance policy, the Tenant was required to either (i) seek consent from the insurer and confirmation from the insurer that the title insurance cover will continue notwithstanding the alteration or implementation of planning permission, or (ii) obtain a new title insurance policy covering the same risk and which would not be voided by the aforementioned alterations or application for or implementation of any planning permission. The relevant land was registered at the HM Land Registry in September 2023 with title absolute and therefore (1) the title insurance in relation to this risk ceased to apply; and (2) the site-specific provisions inserted in the lease also ceased to apply (save in the event that there was any antecedent breach). - **Scotland: a kilted form of the SLB Master Leases for the stores in Scotland follows largely the same format as the SLB Master Leases, with the following changes: o Statutory references have been amended to applicable Scottish law. In particular, references to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 have been removed as the act is not applicable in Scotland, meaning that the tenant has no statutory right to renew. o The renewal option in the England & Wales leases is amended to a lease extension option under the Scottish leases (for the same term and on the same notice as under the England & Wales leases). o The assignment condition is amended to remove the option for the current Tenant to provide an authorised guarantee agreement (and therefore requires the assignee to either meet the Rating Criteria or to provide a guarantor). o The event of default for breach of lease is amended so that if such breach is capable of remedy, the Tenant has a reasonable period to remedy the breach following receipt of a notice from the landlord before an event of default is triggered. o The underletting provisions are amended to remove requirements on the undertenant to enter into deeds of covenant directly with the landlord. o The environmental provisions are also amended to reflect the underlying Scottish legislative regime, and where there is title indemnity insurance benefitting the premises, the alterations provisions prevent the Tenant applying for or implementing any planning permissions without obtaining an endorsement amending the insured use to cover the proposed works.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Alternatively, where the Tenant or any guarantor meets the Rating Criteria, the tenant or such guarantor",136.42.2,,"may give the landlord an authorised guarantee agreement under Section 16 of the Landlord and Tenant (Covenants) Act 1995 guaranteeing the obligations of the proposed assignee or if the proposed assignee does not meet any of the Rating Criteria, the proposed assignee may provide a guarantor for its obligations, such guarantor entity meeting any of the Rating Criteria. The landlord may withhold consent to any assignment of the Master Lease where (i) in the landlord’s reasonable opinion, the proposed assignee (when assessed together with any proposed guarantor of the proposed assignee other than under an authorised guarantee agreement) is not of sufficient financing standing to pay the rent and other sums payable under the Master Lease and to company with the Tenant’s covenants in the Master Lease; (ii) the proposed assignee or its guarantor is a company incorporated in or an individual resident in a country outside the United Kingdom and there is no treaty for the mutual enforcement of judgements between the United Kingdom and that country; (iii) the proposed assignee or its guarantor is a person who enjoys sovereign or state immunity, unless a department, body or agency of the United Kingdom; or (iv) (a) the proposed assignee is a person or entity controlled by a person designated under the OFAC, United Nations, European Union or His Majesty’s Treasury sanctions regimes or (b) the proposed assignee is a politically exposed person (PEP), a PEP’s family member or a known close associate of a PEP (all such terms as defined in regulation 35(1) of The Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Transfer of Funds (Information on the Payer) Regulations 2017). _Subletting_ The Tenant may underlet the whole or any part of the relevant SLB Property provided that it obtains the prior written consent of the landlord, which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The undertenant is to enter into a direct deed of covenant in favour of the landlord both (i) to comply with the undertenant’s covenants in the underlease whilst it remains an undertenant; and (ii) to procure that any proposed assignee of the underlease enters into a direct deed of covenant with the landlord on an assignment of the underlease. Any underlease is to be granted (i) without reserving a fine or premium; (ii) at the open market rent reasonably obtainable at the time of the grant of the underlease for the premises underlet; (iii) where the term exceeds five years, containing provisions for the review of rent consistent with open market practice at the relevant time; and (iv) including covenants which are not inconsistent with or impair the performance and observance of the covenants of the Tenant in the Master Lease provided that the Tenant is able to allow the undertenant a rent free or concessionary rent period or provide an inducement or other incentive payment to take the underlease so far as is consistent with normal market practice. Any underlease must not benefit from the statutory right of renewal contained in the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 and must be for a term which expires before the expiry of the Master Lease (not applicable for the Master Leases of the Scottish assets). No underlease of part of the relevant SLB Property shall permit creation of further underleases of part of the relevant SLB Property that is underlet but may allow (i) further underleases of whole subject to obtaining the prior consent of the landlord where it would be required to such underletting under the Master Lease (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and such further underlease shall not permit any further underletting of whole or part of the relevant SLB Property and (ii) granting of licences or other rights to share occupation of part of areas of the carpark or units of the store as set out under ‘Concessions’ below which do not create any relationship of landlord and tenant. 260 ----- The Tenant may without the landlord’s consent enter into underleases of (i) any individual unit located outside the footprint of the main store forming part of the relevant SLB Property for a term not exceeding ten years or (ii) for automated teller machines or electrical vehicle charging points or (iii) of any individual unit located within the footprint of the main store forming part of the relevant SLB Property for terms not exceeding ten years at a rent that may not correspond to the passing rent under the relevant Master Lease and which may permit the undertenant to trade in its own name or under franchise arrangements (the “Permitted Underleases”) provided that (in relation to all Permitted Underleases): (a) the asset rating (as defined under the Energy Performance of Buildings (England and Wales) Regulations 2012 (as amended) (Asset Rating) is not adversely affected; (b) any underlease does not benefit from the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 (not applicable for the Master Leases of the Scottish Assets); (c) any underlease shall terminate on or before the termination of the Master Lease and shall contain a provision by which it shall automatically terminate upon the determination (including forfeiture) of the Master Lease; (d) the terms of the underlease are not inconsistent with, nor impair the due performance by the Tenant of its obligations in the Master Lease and (e) unless it is granted at a rent that the landlord has confirmed is the open market rental value of the underlet premises at the date of the grant of the underlease any such underlease must contain a statement by the Tenant and undertenant that they are not acknowledging the rent reserved by the underlease is the open market rental value of the underlet premises at the date of grant of the underlease (provided that where such underlease is granted pursuant to an agreement for lease or other contractual agreement which pre-dates the date of the relevant Master Lease, the Tenant shall use reasonable endeavours to seek the agreement of the relevant undertenant to the inclusion of such a statement). _Concessions_ The Tenant may without the landlord’s consent grant licences or other rights to share occupation in relation to (a) any individual unit or area of the car park located outside the footprint of the main store forming part of the relevant SLB Property and (b) any individual unit located within the footprint of the main store forming part of the relevant SLB Property, in both cases (i) so long as the relevant SLB Property retains the appearance of a single trading store and (ii) the relevant SLB Property retains its asset rating under the Energy Performance of Buildings (England and Wales) Regulations 2012 or, in relation to the Master Leases of the Scottish assets the equivalent legislation in place in Scotland. _Maximum Area subject to Subletting and Concessions_ The Tenant may only grant concessions of areas of the carpark or units of the store as set out under ‘Concessions’ above and/or Permitted Underleases (i) in relation to premises outside the footprint of the main store forming part of the relevant SLB Property over an aggregate area of up to (and including) 40% in total of the aggregate of gross external area (as measured in accordance with the Code of Measuring Practice issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) of the buildings on the relevant SLB Property as at the date of the relevant Master Lease, (ii) in relation to unbuilt upon areas of the relevant SLB Property (including landscape area and car park, if applicable) over an aggregate area (at any one time) of up to (and including) 40% in total of the unbuilt upon areas of the relevant SLB Property as at the date or the relevant Master Lease and (iii) in relation to premises within the footprint of the main store forming part of the relevant SLB Property, over an aggregate area (at any one time) of up to (and including) 30% in total of the then current gross internal area (as measured in accordance with the Code of Measuring Practice issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors) of the buildings on the relevant SLB Property. _Charging_ The Tenant may charge its interest in respect of the whole of the Master Lease to reputable lending institutions to secure debt but cannot charge its interest in respect of only part of the Master Lease. _Events of Default_ The SLB Master Leases contain a customary event of default (forfeiture) provision, which include: (i) failure of the Tenant to pay the rent or any other sums due under the SLB Master Leases within 15 working days after the due date; (ii) the Tenant breaches any of its obligations in the SLB Master Leases; (iii) the bankruptcy of the Tenant or any guarantor, including liquidation, the appointment of an administrator or receiver, entry into a scheme of an arrangement with creditors or is subject to a winding up order under Part IV of the Insolvency Act 1986 unless for the purposes of a solvent amalgamation or reconstruction of the company; (iv) disclaimer of the SLB Master Leases by the Crown or by a liquidator or trustee in bankruptcy of the Tenant; (v) the Tenant or any guarantor is struck off the 261 ----- Register of Companies; (vi) the Tenant or any guarantor ceases to exist provided that (in respect of any of (i) – (vi)) in relation to any guarantor the landlord’s right of forfeiture shall only arise (i) where the Tenant at the time of the right arising does not meet the Rating Criteria and (ii) the Tenant fails to provide a replacement guarantor (to the extent relevant). There are standard mortgagee protection provisions in respect of the events of default relating to nonpayment of rent and breach of tenant obligations only (and only where such breach is remediable) which oblige the landlord to give notice to any mortgagee of the remedial actions required to remedy the relevant event of default and allow the mortgagee 28 days to complete the remedial actions following the service of such notice. _Insurance_ If the Tenant elects not to insure the relevant SLB Property, the landlord is obliged to insure the relevant SLB Property demised pursuant to the relevant Master Lease against insured risks (which includes standard insured risk events including fire, lightning, explosion, earthquake, landslip, heave, subsidence, riot, damage caused by terrorism, civil commotion, aircraft, aerial devices, storm, flood, water, bursting and overflowing of water tanks, apparatus or pipes, theft, impact by vehicles, malicious damage and third party liability and any other risks reasonably required by the landlord or the Tenant) to cover full rebuilding, site clearance, VAT and three (3) years’ loss of rent. The Tenant will pay the premium, as well as the cost of insurance valuations, excesses and the cost of rebuilding the relevant SLB Property if insurance monies are irrecoverable due to the Tenant’s breach of the lease. The landlord is obliged to use all reasonable but commercially prudent endeavours to obtain any consents required to reinstate insured damage. If it is not possible to reinstate the insured damage all insurance monies will belong to the landlord. _Termination due to damage by Insured or Uninsured Risks_ The landlord (subject to having complied with its obligations to reinstate) or Tenant may immediately determine the relevant Master Lease if at the expiry of the three (3) year rent suspension period following destruction or damage by an insured risk (which includes standard insured risk events including fire, lightning, explosion, earthquake, landslip, heave, subsidence, riot, damage caused by terrorism, civil commotion, aircraft, aerial devices, storm, flood, water, bursting and overflowing of water tanks, apparatus or pipes, theft, impact by vehicles, malicious damage and third party liability and any other risks reasonably required by the Landlord or the Tenant) the relevant SLB Property has not been substantially made good and remains unfit for occupation and or inaccessible by giving notice within six (6) months of the expiry of the three (3) year rent suspension period. In respect of damage to an SLB Property caused by uninsured damage (being damage caused by an uninsured risk) which causes the SLB Property to be incapable of occupation and use or to be inaccessible (i) the rent will not be suspended and will remain payable by the Tenant in accordance with the terms of the relevant Master Lease; (ii) where the uninsured damage occurs before August 10, 2043 in the case of the initial 22 SLB Properties (or November 15, 2043 for Kings Hill, September 13, 2043 for Poole and August 30, 2043 for Swindon (Haydon)), the Tenant shall reinstate or rebuild the Premises (iii) where the uninsured damage occurs on or after August 10, 2043 (or the relevant dates referred to in (ii) above, as applicable) the Tenant may elect to reinstate or rebuild the SLB Property or at any point four (4) months after the date of uninsured damage, subject to the Tenant not electing to reinstate or rebuild the SLB Property, the landlord may elect to reinstate or rebuild the SLB Property. If the uninsured damage occurs in the last five (5) years of the term of the SLB Master Leases and neither the landlord or Tenant have elected to rebuild or reinstate the SLB Property, the Tenant shall ensure that the SLB Property is kept in a safe secure and tidy condition. _Other Material Provisions_ There are extensive obligations on the Tenant in relation to compliance with environmental laws, providing data to the landlord in relation to environmental performance, and taking any required remedial action at the end of the term to return the relevant SLB Property in a standard required under environmental law. The landlord is not liable for any existing contamination at the SLB Properties.

Holdco’s only assets are the shares in Holdco 2 and its interest in intercompany loans it has made to Holdco 2. Prior to the transfer of the Initial CGR Properties to Propco, Mclagan Investments Limited entered into 99 year CGR Ground Leases (the “CGR Ground Leases” and each a “CGR Ground Lease”) in respect of the Initial CGR Properties with Asda Stores Limited (the “Tenant”). The Initial CGR Properties were transferred from Mclagan Investments Limited to Propco subject to and with the benefit of the CGR Ground Leases. The consideration payable by Propco to Mclagan Investments Limited for the acquisition of the Initial CGR Properties amounted to £646,660,032 and was funded in part by third party financing of £400,000,000 from the CGR Financing Lender (the “CGR",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The documentation includes provisions of a type typically included in real estate finance transactions in the European market, including but not limited to cost and indemnity provisions in favour of the finance parties. The CGR Financing loan agreement also includes representations and undertakings of a type seen in European real estate financing transactions. As such, there are broad restrictions on (amongst other things) Propco incurring further indebtedness, making acquisitions and making disposals. Outside the substitution and release regimes (see “—Substitution mechanics under the CGR Financing” and “—Release of CGR Properties on redemption of CGR Notes”), Propco is restricted from disposing of the CGR Properties and acquiring properties. Propco is subject to restrictions on taking non-ordinary course actions under the CGR Ground Leases (including changing, amending, terminating, forfeiting of the CGR Ground Leases). Propco and Holdco 2 are required to maintain the appointment of an independent director to their respective boards through the term of the CGR Financing. As is common in financings of this nature, certain undertakings and covenants of the CGR Financing require Propco to procure that the transaction obligors take or refrain from taking certain actions. Propco does not have any contractual, corporate or other legal ability to control the actions of the other transaction obligors and so their actions or inactions could cause a breach without Propco having any recourse or ability to prevent it. By way of mitigation, all of the transaction obligors are also controlled by the wider Asda group. The transaction obligors under the CGR Financing are (as well as Propco), Asda Holdco 2 Limited, Asda Group Limited and (for so long as it is an affiliate of Propco) Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited.

The trigger events are: (i) fixed charge cover ratio of less than 2.5x; (ii) the CGR Notes are rated BBB+ or lower; (iii) portfolio gearing is greater than 30%; (iv) any stores has an average historical sales density that is in the lowers 10% of average historical sales densities of all superstores (being any store operated by Asda Group Limited or any of its subsidiaries) which has a net sales area of 15,000 square feet or more (“Superstores”) (“Affected Portfolio Stores”); (v) loan to value (vacant possession) is greater than 65%; and (vi) no more than seven Affected Portfolio Stores have been substituted out.

There are events of default in respect of amongst other things certain breaches of the finance documents, misrepresentation and insolvency. The events of default triggered by compulsory purchase or major damage are subject to the ability to substitute the effective CGR Property and therefore avoid an event of default occurring. Certain events of default can be triggered by circumstances relating to transaction obligors under the CGR Financing (see “—Representations and Undertakings under the CGR Financing”). It is an event of default under the CGR Financing if ASDA Group Limited or any of its subsidiaries fails to comply with its obligations under the CGR Financing tax deed of covenant or breaches any representation and/or warranty set out therein. Market standard events of default are also included for (1) non-compliance of any transaction obligor with any provisions of the Finance Documents; (2) misrepresentation by a transaction obligor; (3) cross default of any financial indebtedness of a transaction obligor; (4) insolvency (but not of Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited); (5) insolvency proceedings (but not of Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited), (6) creditor’s process (but not of Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited); (7) cessation of business (but not of Asda Group Limited or Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited); (8) unlawfulness and invalidity; and (9) repudiation and rescission of agreements. Events of default are included for the insolvency of the Tenant under the CGR Ground Leases, and for persistent non-payment under or material breach of the CGR Ground Leases. In the case of the latter, such an event of default will not arise unless a notice of intended forfeiture under s.146 Law of Property Act 1925 (or an irritancy warning notice in respect of CGR Properties in Scotland) has been served on the Tenant and the Tenant has not complied with such notice, and Propco has not substituted the affected CGR Property. It is an event of default if a judgment of a court, arbitral body or agency which is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect is issued against Propco, Holdco 2 or the Tenant under the CGR Ground Leases. It is an event of default if at any time Propco does not maintain the Expenses Reserve Amount. This event of default is subject to a five business day grace period if there is a shortage of funds available in the rent account to top up the reserve, but all amounts under the CGR Ground Leases have been paid in full. It is an event of default if the CGR Notes are no longer rated and such failure causes the CGR Financing Lender to cease to be a “note-issuing company” within the meaning of Regulation 5 Taxation of Securitisation Company Regulation 2006 (SI 2006/3296). It is also an event of default if any of the CGR Notes are not rated, subject to a carve-out where Propco is in compliance with its obligations under the CGR Financing that relate to maintaining the rating, and a replacement rating is obtained within 90 days.

The outstanding principal balance of CGR Facility A and CGR Facility B (and each repayment instalment) are subject to annual indexation in December of each year. The rate of indexation is calculated as current ‘all items’ CPI divided by the ‘all items’ CPI as at the previous annual review date. It is subject to a floor of 1x and a ceiling of 265 ----- 1.04x, meaning that on each annual indexation date the principal amount and reinstalments will either stay the same or be multiplied by a maximum 1.04 times. Rental payments under the CGR Ground Leases are subject to indexation at the same time annually and in accordance with the same formula such that increases in amounts due under the CGR Financing in respect of interest and amortisation are matched by increases in rent under the CGR Ground Leases. _Interest_ Interest is payable monthly and comprises margin and the benchmark rate. For CGR Facility A the margin is 2.8% and the benchmark rate is 0.990%. For CGR Facility B the margin is 2.944% and the benchmark rate is 1.021%. Default interest accrues on overdue amounts at a rate that is 3% per annum higher than the rate that would otherwise have applied. _Fees and Make whole_ Periodic fees are paid to the agency, security agent and cash manager under the terms of the CGR Financing. A make whole fee is payable on prepayment or cancellation of commitments. The amount of the fee is the sum of the present value of the aggregate scheduled principal and interest payments that would have accrued and become due and payable in respect of the amount prepaid or cancelled from the date of prepayment or cancellation up to the relevant maturity date, discounted to the date of prepayment or cancellation at a rate equal to the reinvestment yield for the relevant Ground Rent Facility plus 0.5%. The ‘reinvestment yield’ is the yield to maturity implied by (a) the ask-side yields reported, as of 10.00 A.M. (London time) on the second Business Day preceding the Settlement Date on the display designated “Page PXUK” on Bloomberg Financial Markets (or such other display as may replace “Page PXUK” on Bloomberg Financial Markets) for actively traded index linked gilt-edged securities having a maturity of the Discount Period; or (b) if such yields are not reported as of such time or the yields reported are not ascertainable, the average of the ask-side yields as determined by the index linked gilt-edged market makers (as registered with the Bank of England). Such implied yield will be determined, if necessary, by: (i) converting quotations to bond-equivalent yields in accordance with accepted financial practice; and (ii) interpolating linearly between the ask-side yields for the (1) actively traded index-linked gilt-edged security with the maturity closest to and greater than the Discount Period and (2) actively traded index-linked gilt-edged security with the maturity closest to and less than the Discount Period. In this paragraph the “Discount Period” is the period between the applicable prepayment/cancellation date and the applicable maturity date. For the purposes of the make-whole, no indexation is assumed after the date of the prepayment or cancelation (as applicable). The make-whole does not apply in the case of prepayment due to illegality, or note level illegality, a tax event or a securitisation regulatory event. The make-whole also does not apply on the periodic amortisation payments. The make-whole does apply to other mandatory prepayments, including from lease prepayment proceeds, insurance prepayment proceeds, compensation prepayment proceeds in respect of compulsory purchase and recovery prepayment proceeds from claims against report providers. If such amounts are received, Propco has the option to substitute the affected CGR Property out of the CGR Financing. If the substitution occurs within six months of receipt of the relevant payment, then the amount will not be swept in prepayment and therefore no make-whole will apply. In addition, certain compensation proceeds, insurance proceeds and report recovery proceeds are excluded from the mandatory prepayment requirement. _Costs and indemnities_ Market standard cost and indemnity provisions are included under the terms of the CGR Financing, including requirements to pay costs and increased costs relating to the CGR Financing and the CGR Notes structure. This includes ongoing operating costs, amendment costs and enforcement and preservation costs. 266 ----- Propco is required to pay reasonably incurred costs of the finance parties in connection with substitutions and with release of security following redemption of the CGR Notes. Propco is required to pay the costs of valuations required under the terms of the CGR Financing, as well as the costs of any valuation required in connection with a substitution or the release of collateral on maturity of the CGR Notes. _Cashflows and Reserves_ The CGR Financing requires Propco to retain bank accounts with a bank with a requisite rating. The bank accounts are subject to security and (other than a Propco-controlled general account) are controlled by a cash manager on behalf of the finance parties. Net rental income and other amounts received by Propco must be paid into the bank accounts and there are detailed provisions in the Ground Rent Transaction Facility Agreement as to the application of cash flows, including payment of operating costs, interest, amortisation. The transaction has been modelled such that all outgoings of Propco are intended to be funded by receipts under and in respect of the CGR Ground Leases. _Payments waterfall_ Net rental income and certain other receipts must be paid into Propco’s rent account. A monthly cashflow payments waterfall is run by a cash manager. This provides for payment of (1) capital receipts to be applied in mandatory prepayment; (2) finance party and account bank costs, fees and expenses; (3) taxes and general corporate maintenance costs of Propco, Holdco 2 or the CGR Financing Lender (subject in the case of such corporate maintenance costs, to a cap of £250,000 per annum annually adjusted by CPI); (4) standby servicer and step-in servicer costs, fees and expenses; (5) costs, fees and expenses due to the finance parties; (6) interest due under the CGR Financing; (7) principal due under the CGR Financing; (8) payment of increased costs in respect of the lenders under the CGR Financing, and increased costs in respect of the holders of the CGR Notes; (9) topping up the debt service reserve (see below); (10) any budgeted amount required to pay ongoing operating/structural costs not already paid above, and any costs and expenses related to a CGR Property substitution or release of collateral; (11) other amounts due to the finance parties under the CGR Financing; and (12) any excess to Propco’s general account unless a cash trap event is continuing in which case such surplus is transferred to the cash trap account. It is a cash trap event if at any time the historic debt service coverage ratio is less than 1.05x on a twelve-month lookback basis. If a cash trap event is continuing on two consecutive interest payment dates, the cash manager is required to apply the monies in the cash trap account in prepayment of the Ground Rent Facility (together with the make-whole (see section 4 above)). If a cash trap event is not continuing on two consecutive interest payment dates, the cash manager shall release the monies to the Propco-controlled general account. _Debt Service Reserve_ A 12-month reserve in respect of items (2) through (6) listed and the amount projected to be payable pursuant to item (7) over the next 12 interest payment dates under “—Payments waterfall” must be maintained by Propco in the debt service account at all times, or alternatively a letter of credit may be provided in an equivalent amount. The debt service reserve is held on trust for the original lender under the CGR Financing and will not form part of Propco’s estate in an insolvency. Any excess so reserved on any monthly interest payment date is released to Propco’s general account (and such excess does not form part of the trust property). _Expenses Reserve_ Propco must prepare an annual budget detailing the ongoing costs of Propco, Holdco 2, the CGR Financing Lender and certain other costs associated with CGR Financing together with the costs associated with any scheduled substitutions of the CGR Properties. Propco must at all times maintain a 12-month reserve in respect of any such costs (the “Expenses Reserve Amount”). 267 ----- _Cures_ Provided the Tenant under the CGR Ground Leases is in compliance with all obligations to pay rent, Propco is permitted to use the proceeds of subordinated debt or equity injections or free cash in the general account to make up for any shortfalls in amounts available to make the payments under the debt service waterfall (see “Cashflows and _Reserves—Payments waterfall”). This may be done within the period between the rental payment date under the CGR_ Ground Leases and the date falling four business days before the next monthly interest payment date. Otherwise Propco is restricted from receiving amounts by way of subordinated debt or equity injection.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

If a tenant under any underlease of the relevant CGR Property becomes a group company of the tenant, or if a Tenant under an underlease of whole or any part of the relevant store becomes an affiliate of the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease, within 12 months, the relevant underlease must be varied to contain a landlord break right permitting the landlord under the underlease to terminate the underlease if (i) the CGR Ground Lease is terminated or otherwise comes to an end in any way and (ii) at the time that the break right arises the tenant of such underlease is a group company or affiliate of the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease. 273 ----- If a tenant under an underlease of part of the relevant CGR Property that is not located within the relevant stores becomes an affiliate of the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease, on and from such date the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease must use reasonable endeavours to ensure that the relevant underlease is varied to include a landlord break right permitting the landlord under the underlease to terminate the underlease if (i) the CGR Ground Lease is terminated or otherwise comes to an end in any way and (ii) at the time that the break right arises the tenant of such underlease is a group company or affiliate of the Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease. _Sharing Occupation_ The Tenant under the CGR Ground Lease may permit a group company (so long as such group company is not an Excluded Occupier) to share occupation provided that no relationship of landlord and tenant is created and such occupation ceases as soon as the companies cease to be group companies or, if earlier, the date on which the CGR Ground Lease expires or otherwise comes to an end.

The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference rules, “thin capitalisation” rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, where the time and cost of granting the guarantee or security would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders or where security would be granted over the Capital Stock, liabilities, property or other assets of any member of the Regulated Group. Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor’s obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise stipulated under the Agreed Security Principles, including to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor’s obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee.

Upon the request of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

(a) The Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining effective or commercially reasonable Notes Guarantees and/or security from all relevant members of the Group in each jurisdiction in which it has been agreed that Notes Guarantees and security will be granted by those members. In particular: (i) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, “transfer pricing,” “thin capitalisation,” “earnings stripping,” “controlled foreign corporation” and other tax restrictions, “exchange control restrictions,” “capital maintenance” rules and “liquidity impairment” rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a Notes Guarantee or security or may require that the Notes Guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the Notes Guarantee or security will be limited accordingly, provided that to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such Notes Guarantee or Security Document shall be subject to such limit; 286 ----- (ii) a key factor in determining whether or not a Notes Guarantee or security will be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable legal fees) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties of obtaining such Notes Guarantee or security; (iii) members of the Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or enter into Security Documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable Security Document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such Notes Guarantee or Security Document shall be subject to such limit;

(viii) the giving of a Notes Guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this clause (viii);

Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than the later of (x) 60 days from the date such notice is delivered and (y) the date of completion of the Change of Control, pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except, in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control, as described below. 304 ----- On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured Notes being purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Senior Secured Notes, unless notation of the purchase of Senior Secured Notes is to be effected in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent the Global Senior Secured Notes, in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; _provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount that is at least £100,000 and integral_ multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalisation or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as described under “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in the payment of the applicable redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control; _provided, however,_ that such Change of Control Offer is conditional upon such Change of Control. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and 305 ----- regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of events that constitute a Change of Control would result in Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement becoming immediately due and payable or subject to a mandatory prepayment and in an obligation to repurchase notes at the option of holders of the Existing Senior Notes under the Existing Senior Notes Indenture and the Existing Senior Secured Notes under the Existing Senior Secured Notes Indentures. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—The Group may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.” The definition_ of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in one or more of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances, letters of guarantee, bank guarantees, bankers’ acceptances, performance guarantees, performance bonds, demand guarantees, warranty guarantees, warranty bonds, bond sureties, payment bonds or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (12), (13), (15) or (16) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and such instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (5) the principal amount of Indebtedness represented by any Disqualified Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; (7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and (8) in the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments to Incur Indebtedness or any Lien pursuant to clauses (10), (28), (30) or (31) of the definition of “Permitted Liens” or any Permitted Collateral Lien, the Incurrence thereof for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, will, at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date such commitments are entered into or increased pursuant to binding documentation or (b) be determined on the date such Indebtedness or Liens are Incurred. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to test Incurrence as described in the preceding sub-clause (a), the full amount of Indebtedness made available under such commitments (the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount”), and the related Liens, will be deemed Incurred on the date of execution of such binding documentation and, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or any other Indebtedness or Lien Incurrence test under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing, re-borrowing or issuance of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments thereunder will be permitted under this covenant and under the covenant described under “—Limitation on Liens,” irrespective of whether the same Incurrence test is met at the time of actual borrowing, re-borrowing or issuance of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments thereunder. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may revoke such election at any time and from time to time. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations initially not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness.” Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount or (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. 312 ----- If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “—Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be permitted to designate such Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary and any such designation will not be deemed operative under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture).

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and the applicable Notes Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms; provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, by written notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. For the avoidance of doubt, the bankruptcy provisions will exclude the enforcement of Liens described in clause (31) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” including by way of appointment of a receiver for such purpose. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) has been remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default has been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all other Events of Default outstanding, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Secured Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. 338 ----- Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any), and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Other than in cases where the Senior Secured Notes Indenture permits the Trustee or the Security Agent to act without instructions from Holders or with instructions given by Holders of a lower percentage of principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be entitled to (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, (ii) give instructions to the Security Agent for the purpose of taking, ceasing or refraining from taking any enforcement action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, (iii) give instructions to the Security Agent for the purpose of granting or withholding any such consent or exercising any such remedy or power as may be required or contemplated under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents or (iv) give instructions to the Trustee for the purposes of giving or withholding any such consent, taking, ceasing or refraining from taking any such action or exercising any such remedy or power as may be contemplated under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability, provided, however, that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is not inconsistent with such direction. 339 ----- Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or other security satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action, and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Certain Covenants—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The Trustee and the Security Agent (where relevant) shall, at the direction of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, sign any supplemental indenture or other documentation that gives effect to amendments, waivers or supplements authorised as described under this heading “Amendments and Waivers” if the amendment, waiver or supplement does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent. Except as set forth in the preceding proviso, it shall only be necessary for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent (where relevant) to authorise and execute a supplemental indenture or other documentation in order to effect an amendment, waiver or supplement authorised as described under this heading “Amendments and Waivers.” Unless otherwise specified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a waiver authorised as described under this heading “Amendments and Waivers” will become effective once the requisite consent of Holders has been obtained, without execution of any supplemental indenture or other documentation. The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender. 342 ----- A written consent to an amendment or a waiver by a Holder shall bind the Holder and every subsequent Holder of that Senior Secured Note or portion of the Senior Secured Notes that evidences the same Indebtedness as the consenting Holder’s Senior Secured Note, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the Senior Secured Note. Unless otherwise specified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the relevant request for consent, such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the written consent or waiver as to such Holder’s Senior Secured Note or portion of such Senior Secured Note if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date on which the Trustee receives an Officer’s Certificate from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer certifying that the requisite number of consents have been received. After an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give their written consent or take any other action. If a record date is fixed, then only those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 180 days after such record date. For purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have taken any action under this Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes will be deemed to be the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes as of (i) the record date in respect of such action (if a record date has been set with respect to the taking of such action), (ii) the date the taking of such action by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes has been certified to the Trustee by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or (iii) as of a date selected by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is within the consent delivery period or no more than five Business Days prior to the beginning of the consent delivery period, as specified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the relevant consent materials. In formulating their decisions on matters set forth in this Section “Amendments and Waivers,” the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as they deem necessary, including Officer’s Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security has advantages over floating charge security. Until floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge. On an insolvency of a charging company: (a) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as against a floating charge over the same charged assets (provided that the floating charge had not crystallised at the time the fixed charge was granted and there were no restrictions on the creation of such security which the fixed charge holder was aware of); (b) general costs and expenses (including the remuneration of insolvency office-holders and the costs of continuing to operate the business of the charging company while in administration) properly incurred in an insolvency process are generally payable out of the assets of the charging company (including the assets (including cash) that are the subject of the floating charge) and insolvency office-holders appointed to a charging company can convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash to meet such general costs and expenses in priority to the claims of the floating charge holder to the extent that the value of the charging company’s unsecured assets is not sufficient to cover such costs and expenses in full and in each case provided that the floating charge is not created or does not otherwise arise under a financial collateral arrangement (see below); (c) an administrator may dispose of or take action relating to property subject to a floating charge without the prior consent of the charge holder or court, although the floating charge holder retains the same priority in respect of the proceeds from the disposal of the assets subject to the floating charge; (d) where the floating charge is not created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” (generally, a charge over cash or financial instruments such as shares, bonds or tradeable capital market debt instruments and credit claims) under the Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial Collateral Regulations”), assets subject to floating charge security are subject to the claims of certain preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part for unsecured creditors (see “—Priority on insolvency” below); and (e) there are particular insolvency “clawback” risks in relation to floating charge security. A floating charge cannot crystallise upon or following entry of the charging company into a Part A1 Moratorium (as defined below), and charge holders are prevented from imposing restrictions on the disposal of the charged assets for the duration of the Part A1 Moratorium (see “—Limitation on enforcement— _Moratoriums” below)._ There is a possibility under English law that a court could find that fixed security interests expressed to be created by a security document governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than recharacterised as floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the charging company’s ability to deal with the 396 ----- relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the charging company is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

In each case and subject to specific conditions, an administration order can be made if the court is satisfied that (a) the relevant company is or is likely to become “unable to pay its debts” (although this requirement does not apply if the applicant is a holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (discussed below)) and (b) the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. A company is deemed to be unable to pay its debts if it is insolvent on a “cash flow” basis (unable to pay its debts as they fall due) or if it is insolvent on a “balance sheet” basis (the value of the company’s assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities), in each case under Section 123 of the Insolvency Act. “Cash flow” insolvency is presumed if, among other matters, the company fails either to satisfy a creditor’s statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or to satisfy in full or in part a judgment debt (or similar court order). The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company’s creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. The order of priority which applies to any distribution to creditors is set out below (see “—Priority on insolvency”). Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, the debtor company, the directors of such company or the holder of a “qualifying floating charge” (as described in “—Qualifying floating charge”) where the floating charge has become enforceable may also appoint an administrator out of court. Different appointment procedures apply according to the identity of the appointor. An administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business of the company to which they are appointed and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A set proportion of the proceeds of the realisation of any property subject to a floating charge will need to be set aside for the satisfaction of the claims of preferential creditors and the ring-fencing of the Prescribed Part (see “—Prescribed Part”). An administrator may also, with prior approval by the court, deal with assets subject to a fixed charge, provided that disposing of the property is likely to promote the purpose of the administration and the administrator applies the net proceeds from the disposal towards discharging the obligations of the company to the fixed charge holder. An administrator may also dispose of property of a company subject to a fixed charge with the consent of the relevant fixed charge holder(s). In addition, certain rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration. Upon the appointment of an administrator, any existing Part A1 Moratorium (see “—Moratoriums”) will come to an end, a statutory moratorium is imposed such that no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company’s property except with the consent of the administrator or leave of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. An interim moratorium on similar terms will apply where an application for an administration order has been made but not yet granted or dismissed (or where an administration order has not yet taken effect) or from such time as a notice of an intention to appoint an administrator has been filed until the earlier of the appointment of an administrator and the expiry of a period of five business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed 397 ----- by the holder of a qualifying floating charge) or 10 business days (where the administrator is proposed to be appointed by the company or directors). However, certain creditors of a company in administration may, in certain defined circumstances, be able to realise their security over certain of that company’s property notwithstanding the statutory moratorium. This is by virtue of the disapplication of the moratorium in relation to any security interest created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations. If an English company was to enter administration, while that company was in administration it would not be possible to, without permission of the court or consent of the administrator, to enforce any security granted by that company unless such security constituted a financial collateral arrangement. A demand for payment could be made under any guarantee granted by the company but no legal process could be instituted against the company in connection therewith without the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court. Accordingly, if any English Obligors were to enter into administration, the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable, may not be enforceable (save to the extent that the Collateral constitutes a financial collateral arrangement) without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator while the relevant company was in administration. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the Security Agent would obtain such permission of the court or consent of the administrator.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The holder of a qualifying floating charge is also entitled to advance notice of an intention of a company or its directors to appoint an administrator, allowing the charge holder to either appoint its own administrator (or, where applicable, administrative receiver) in place of the proposed administrator, conduct negotiations with the proposed appointors over the identity or terms of appointment of the proposed administrator or (in an extreme case) prevent the company going into administration. A floating charge constitutes a qualifying floating charge if it is created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it (being paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act), (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company, or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act.

The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to “capital market arrangements,” which may apply if the issue of the Senior Secured Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a “capital market investment” (which is defined in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A of the Insolvency Act and includes rated, listed or traded debt instruments and debt instruments designed to be rated, listed or traded).

If appointed pursuant to the terms of a security agreement, grounds for appointment under the terms of the charge (such as a default) must exist and the charging company must have failed to satisfy the demand made for an appointment to take place. A receivership is not a process pursuant to English insolvency laws as such and a fixed charge receivership can be run in parallel to a liquidation or an administration. However, an administrator may require a fixed charge receiver to vacate office unless that fixed charge receiver was appointed under a charge created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement,” as per Regulation 8(4) of the Financial Collateral Regulations (see “—Administration” above). The primary duty of a fixed charge receiver is to realise the assets over which (s)he is appointed, meaning (s)he owes an over-riding duty of care to the appointor, although certain limited duties are also owed to the chargor. This contrasts with the duty of an administrator, who performs his/her duties in the interests of a company’s creditors as a whole. In other words, receivership is a proprietary remedy whereas administration is a collective procedure. In realising the charged assets, the receiver will need to take reasonable care to obtain the best price obtainable in the circumstances. In doing so, the fixed charge receiver will be entitled to a statutory indemnity in respect of any liabilities from the realisations made of the assets of the company (and may also have the benefit of a contractual indemnity from the appointor). To the extent the receiver has been appointed under a crystallised floating charge, amounts will be deducted from the proceeds of the realisation of the charged assets to pay the Prescribed Part and any preferential creditors (see “—Prescribed Part”).",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

An English Obligor may be able to propose a scheme in respect of its financial liabilities. In addition, a foreign Obligor which (a) is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act and (b) has a “sufficient connection” to England and Wales could also propose a scheme. In practice, a foreign company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company’s COMI is in England, the company’s finance documents are English law governed or the company’s finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors and/or members will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors/members that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors/members and are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or 399 ----- its creditors (although in practice a creditor-led scheme would nonetheless require the cooperation of the company or its insolvency officeholder). If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors/members present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors/members vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors/members, including those affected creditors/members who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the scheme. In exercising its discretion to sanction a scheme of a foreign Obligor, the court will likely refuse to sanction a scheme for an unregistered company where to do so would not be likely to serve any real purpose. Whether the effect of the scheme will be recognised in the jurisdiction of incorporation of a foreign company or a company with its COMI in a foreign jurisdiction will depend on the jurisdiction in question. The English court has previously sanctioned schemes where expert evidence was provided showing that the scheme of arrangement (or its effect) is likely to have effect in such jurisdictions. However, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not this test would be satisfied in any given case. Once sanctioned, the scheme of arrangement binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the scheme of arrangement, which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the scheme of arrangement to the Registrar of Companies. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings. A company may, however, propose a scheme of arrangement while subject to a Part A1 Moratorium which may remain in place until sanctioning of the scheme (see “—Moratoriums”).",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

While generally available to the same domestic and foreign companies as schemes of arrangement, a company seeking to enter into a restructuring plan process must show that (a) it has encountered, or is likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern, and (b) a compromise or arrangement has been proposed between the company and its creditors and its member (or any class of them) whose purpose it is to eliminate, reduce or prevent, or mitigate the effect of, any of those financial difficulties. Save as set out above, there are no financial eligibility criteria, thereby making it available to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency office holder). Where a convening application is made within 12 weeks after the end of the new standalone moratorium (see below), any creditors in respect of “moratorium debts” and “priority pre-moratorium debts” (see “—Moratorium”) may not participate in the vote and may not be compromised under the restructuring plan without their consent. A restructuring plan may be proposed by the debtor company, any creditor or member of the company or any liquidator or administrator appointed to the company. The consent of the company (or its insolvency officeholder) is required if the plan is proposed by a creditor or shareholder. The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent’s application to convene a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof). At the convening hearing, the court will examine the proposed classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to sanction the proposed restructuring plan. As with a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors and members will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes depending on the rights of such creditors which will be affected by the proposed restructuring plan and any new rights that such creditors are given under the restructuring plan. Creditors/Members whose rights would be affected by the compromise or arrangement must be permitted to participate in a meeting to vote on the restructuring plan, unless the court is satisfied that they have no genuine economic interest in the company (which the court will determine by reference to the “relevant alternative,” being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned). Equally, creditors/members whose rights are not being compromised under 400 ----- the restructuring plan can be excluded from voting. However, there must be legitimate commercial reasons for excluding them from the scope of the plan and full disclosure must be made. If the court is satisfied that it has jurisdiction, it will order a meeting of the relevant creditors and/or members (or classes thereof) to vote on the proposed restructuring plan. Details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder in each class, accompanied by details of the plan and directors’ material interests in the company. A restructuring plan will be deemed to be approved if at least 75% in value of the creditors/members present and voting at the meeting of at least one class of creditors/members vote in favour of the proposed compromise. There is no requirement for the approving creditors/members to constitute a majority in number of those creditors/members present and voting. Following approval of the restructuring plan at the relevant meeting(s), the restructuring plan needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review whether the applicable statutory conditions have been met and may also consider whether the restructuring plan is just and equitable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the restructuring plan even if the requisite majority of one or more classes of creditors or members did not vote in favour of it, thereby “cramming down” dissenting classes provided that the court is satisfied that (a) none of the members of a dissenting class would be any worse off if the restructuring plan were to be sanctioned than they would be in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’ and (b) the restructuring plan was approved by at least one class of creditors/members who would receive a payment or have a genuine economic interest in the company in the event of the ‘relevant alternative’. The ‘relevant alternative’ for the purposes of this assessment is whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned. By virtue of these mechanics, the restructuring plan process provides for the possibility of a ‘cross-class cram-down’, meaning the courts may sanction a restructuring plan even if one or more classes of affected creditors/members do not vote in favour of the restructuring plan, effectively allowing the vote of one class of stakeholders to bind other classes. The court also has discretion to make an order conditional upon modifications being made or refuse to sanction the restructuring plan. Once sanctioned, the restructuring plan binds all affected stakeholders whose rights will be as set out in the restructuring plan, which shall be effective (in accordance with its terms) upon delivery of the court’s order sanctioning the restructuring plan to the Registrar of Companies or, where the company is an overseas company, publication of the court’s order in the Gazette. As with schemes of arrangement, the commencement of a restructuring plan process does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings but a company may propose a restructuring plan while subject to a Part A1 Moratorium.

Pursuant to Part I of the Insolvency Act, a company (by its directors or its administrator or liquidator, as applicable) may propose a company voluntary arrangement to the company’s shareholders and creditors which entails a compromise, or other arrangement, between the company and its creditors, typically a rescheduling or reducing of the company’s debts. Provided that the proposal is approved by the requisite majority of creditors by way of a decision procedure, it will bind all unsecured creditors who were entitled to vote on the proposal or who would have been entitled to vote if they had notice of the decision procedure. A company voluntary arrangement cannot affect the rights of a secured creditor or a preferential creditor, except with its consent. In order for the company voluntary arrangement proposal to be passed, it must be approved by at least 75% (by value) of the company’s creditors who respond in the decision procedure, and no more than 50% (by value) of unconnected creditors may vote against it. Secured debt cannot be voted in a company voluntary arrangement, however, a secured creditor may vote to the extent that its claims are unsecured. A secured creditor who proves in the company voluntary arrangement for the whole of its debt may be deemed to have given up its security. The company’s members will also be asked to vote on the CVA (and will be considered approved if more than 50% in value of the company’s members present in person or by proxy and voting at a meeting on the resolution approve the company 401 ----- voluntary arrangement). However, if the company’s creditors approve the proposal, the CVA will be implemented notwithstanding a vote against by the members. Anyone entitled to vote on the proposal may apply to the court to challenge the approval of a company voluntary arrangement in certain circumstances. Unlike an administration proceeding, a company voluntary arrangement does not automatically trigger a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the_ Register of Companies. There are two forms of winding-up: (a) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (b) members’ voluntary liquidation or creditors’ voluntary liquidation, in each case by resolution of the company’s members (save where it follows an administration). Companies registered in England and Wales or foreign companies with their COMI in England and Wales, with their COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in England and Wales or which have a “sufficient connection” with England and Wales to justify the court exercising its jurisdiction may be wound up via compulsory liquidation. Only companies registered in England and Wales may be subject to voluntary liquidation (save that a foreign company where its COMI is in England and Wales or in an EU member state (except Denmark) (but which has an “establishment” in England and Wales) may enter a creditors’ voluntary liquidation). The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary winding-up. In a compulsory winding up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act any disposition of the relevant company’s property made after the commencement of the winding up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a “financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced at the time of the presentation of the winding up petition. Once a winding up order is made by the court, any existing Part A1 Moratorium (see “—Moratoriums”) will come to an end and a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No action or proceeding may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court and subject to such terms as the court may impose although there is no freeze on the enforcement of security. The difference between the two voluntary proceedings is whether the directors of the company are willing to swear a statutory declaration as to the company’s solvency over the following 12 months (if so, the process is a members’ voluntary liquidation) which must be done not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding-up resolution. The primary ground for the creditors’ voluntary liquidation of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act - see “—Administration”) and there is no need for the directors to swear a statutory declaration of solvency (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). Note that while a creditors’ voluntary liquidation (other than as an exit from administration) is initiated by a resolution of the members, not the creditors, once in place the process is subject to some degree of control by the creditors. In the context of a voluntary winding up, however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or contributory of the company, to apply for a stay to prevent the continuation of legal proceedings and enforcement of security. Any existing Part A1 Moratorium will terminate upon commencement of a voluntary winding-up. This is important because, if a stay is not obtained, it means creditors, for example, can initiate proceedings against the company (and/or enforce their security). 402 ----- On the appointment of a liquidator, the directors’ powers to bind the company automatically cease, save for those powers that are sanctioned by the liquidator or creditors (as appropriate). A liquidator has, among other things, the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding up, to sell the company’s property (provided that in respect of the sale of any property that is secured by a fixed charge in favour of a creditor, if that sale is made without the secured creditor’s consent, it will be made subject to that security, as the creditor’s consent will be needed to the release of the security), and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions (see “— _Avoidance of Transactions”)._",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Under and in accordance with the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency Rules, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company’s property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior-ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. As an exception to the principle of pari passu distribution, insolvency set-off, which sees an account being taken of what is due from each party to the other in respect of their mutual dealings, and whereby only any net balance owed by the company is provable in the administration or liquidation, will apply in a liquidation or distributing administration. Insolvency set-off is mandatory and automatic as of the date of liquidation or the date on which the administrator has given notice that they intend to make a distribution to creditors. The effect of insolvency set-off is that the creditor receives full value for its claim to the extent of the amount that it owes the company (in circumstances where it might otherwise, as an unsecured creditor, receive little or no dividend in respect of that element of its claim). However, insolvency set-off will not apply to all amounts owing between the creditor and debtor company; amongst other things, claims arising after a certain cut-off date will be excluded and the requisite degree of mutuality must exist. Parties cannot waive the application of, or alter the scope or operation of, insolvency set-off by contractual agreement (insolvency set-off will displace all other rights of contractual set-off, which have not been exercised before the time at which insolvency set-off applies). The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - _First ranking: holders of fixed charge security (but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness) and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest; - _Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate e.g. any prescribed fees or expenses of the official receiver, moratorium debts, (in certain circumstances) certain “priority pre-moratorium debts” and expenses of the liquidation or administration (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - _Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (a) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (b) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; and (c) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the date of insolvency; and (d) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit. As between one another, ordinary preferential debts rank equally; 403 ----- Secondary preferential debts rank for payment after the discharge of ordinary preferential debts and include (but are not limited to) claims by HMRC in respect of certain taxes including VAT, PAYE income tax, employee NI contributions, student loan repayments and Construction Industry Scheme deductions (but excluding corporation tax and employer NI contributions which are held by the company on behalf of employees and customers), as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 of the Insolvency Act. As between one another, secondary preferential debts rank equally; - _Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. This would include any security interest that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on proper interpretation by the court, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realisations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - _Fifth ranking: - firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under section 74(2(f)) of the Insolvency Act) and (to the extent of any unsecured shortfall) secured creditors, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These debts rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency office-holder can only use realisations from unsecured assets as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors or the secured creditor elects to surrender its security; - secondly, interest on the company’s unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the rate determined in accordance with the Judgments Act 1838 (currently 8% per annum)) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation (or any preceding administration, where applicable) or administration. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Senior Secured Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may, if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and - thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; and - _Sixth ranking: shareholders. If, after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subject to the above order of priority, subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation. Where the debtor company enters into administration or winding-up proceedings within 12 weeks of the end of a Part A1 Moratorium, certain moratorium-related debts will benefit from ‘super priority’ and will rank immediately following the first ranking debts, and ahead of the second ranking debts, set out above. The relevant debts comprise prescribed fees and expenses of any official receiver, debts incurred during the Part A1 Moratorium and priority pre-moratorium debts (see “—Moratoriums”).",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244). These provisions all apply where the company has gone into an English liquidation or administration, with the exception of section 423 which can be invoked even if the company is not in insolvency proceedings.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

In an administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c) otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect. In a compulsory liquidation, the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes the relevant winding-up resolution. Where liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as for the initial administration. 405 ----- _Connected persons_ If a given transaction at an undervalue, preference or invalid floating charge has been entered into by the company with a “connected person,” then particular specified time periods and presumptions will apply to any challenge by an administrator or liquidator (as set out below). A “connected person” of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences or invalid floating charges is a party who is: (a) a director of the company; (b) a shadow director; (c) an associate of such director or shadow director; or (d) an associate of the relevant company. A party is associated with an individual if they are: (a) a relative of the individual; (b) the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (c) a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner; (d) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual; or (e) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual’s husband, wife or civil partner. A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company (and in this case, directors of a company are treated as employees of that company). A person is also an associate of any person whom he employs. A company is an associate of another person if that person has control of it or if that person and persons who are his associates together have control of it. A company is associated with another company if i) the same person has control of both companies, or ii) a person has control of one and persons who are his associates, or he and persons who are his associates, have control of the other, or iii) if a group of two or more persons has control of each company and the groups either consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate. A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company. The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest or guarantee granted by or any transaction entered into by the English Obligors include, without limitation, the following described below. _Transactions at an undervalue_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or other relevant transaction), or grant other relief where the creation of such security interest or guarantee (or other relevant transaction) constituted a transaction at an undervalue. A transaction will only be a transaction at an undervalue if, at the time of the transaction or as a consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if it took place within the relevant time (two years before the onset of the company’s insolvency). In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see “—Connected _persons”), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the_ company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction and did not become unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction. A transaction may be set aside as a transaction at an undervalue if the company made a gift to a person, if the company received no consideration or if the company received consideration of significantly less value, in money or money’s worth, than the consideration given by such company. However, a court will not make an order if it is satisfied that the company entered into the transaction in good faith and for the purpose of carrying on its business and that, at the time it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing the transaction would benefit it. 406 ----- If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under the guarantees or setting aside security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preferences_ Under English insolvency law, a liquidator or administrator could apply to the court for an order to set aside payments, the creation of a security interest or a guarantee (or other relevant transaction), or grant other relief, where such payment, creation of security interest or guarantee (or other relevant transaction) constituted a preference. A transaction will only be a preference if, at the time of the transaction or in consequence of the transaction, the company is unable to pay its debts or becomes unable to pay its debts (as defined in Section 123 of the Insolvency Act). The transaction can be challenged if the company enters into insolvency within a period of six months (if the beneficiary of the security or the guarantee is not a connected person) or two years (if the beneficiary is a connected person, except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee) from the date the company enters into the transaction. A transaction may constitute a preference if the company does something or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has the effect of putting a creditor of the company (or a surety or guarantor for any of the company’s debts or liabilities) in a better position (in the event of the company going into insolvent liquidation) than such creditor, guarantor or surety would otherwise have been in had that thing not been done. However, a court shall not make an order unless the company which entered into the transaction was influenced by a desire to put that person in a preferential position when taking their decision. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company’s employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them. The desire to prefer requires a positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of the company’s insolvent liquidation. A preferential effect for a creditor may be foreseen by the company without being desired. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Collateral and any other security interests or guarantees. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the company. _Transactions defrauding creditors_ Under English insolvency law, where a transaction was at an undervalue and the court is satisfied that it was made for the substantial purpose (it does not need to be the sole purpose) of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making, or may make, a claim against the company in question, or of otherwise prejudicing the interests of a person in relation to the claim which that person is making or may make, the transaction may be set aside by the court as a transaction defrauding creditors. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a “victim” of the transaction including the UK Financial Conduct Authority, the UK Prudential Regulation Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and use of the provision is therefore not limited to liquidators or administrators. The Insolvency Act does not prescribe a set time 407 ----- limit within which to bring the action and the relevant company does not need to be insolvent at the time of, or as a result of, the transaction. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court may make such order as it sees fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction, which may include reducing payments due under or setting aside the Senior Secured Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Collateral and any other security interests or guarantees. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate Credit Transactions_ An administrator or a liquidator can apply to court to set aside an extortionate credit transaction. A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either i) the terms of it are (or were) such as to require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit or ii) it otherwise grossly contravened ordinary principles of fair dealing. It is presumed, unless otherwise proved by the person extending the credit, that a transaction with respect to which an administrator or liquidator makes an application to set aside an extortionate credit transaction in extortionate. The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by a company up to three years before the day on which a company entered administration or liquidation (which is slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences). That order may set aside, either in whole or in part, any obligation created by the transaction (which could include obligations of sureties). It may also vary the terms of the transaction or the terms of any security for the purposes of the transaction. The court may require any party to the transaction to repay to the liquidator or administrator sums already paid under the transaction and it may order the surrender of any security held for the purpose of the transaction. It should be noted that there are no provisions for the protection of third parties who acquire interests in the extortionate credit transaction (e.g. assignees of the benefit of the transaction from the person who provided credit under it). _Voidable floating charges_ Under section 245 of the Insolvency Act, floating charges created by a company within a period of one year prior to the entry by the company into an English insolvency process (or two years in the case of a floating charge in favour of a connected person) at a time when the company was unable to pay its debts or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction (within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act) will be invalid, except to the extent of the value of: (a) the money paid to; (b) the goods or services supplied to; or (c) any discharge or reduction of any debt of, the relevant company at the same time as or after the creation of the floating charge (plus certain interest) (the “Consideration”). The requirement for a company to be unable to pay its debts at the time of granting the floating charge or to become insolvent as a consequence of doing so does not apply where the floating charge is granted to a connected person. An administrator or liquidator (as applicable) does not need to apply to court for an order declaring that a floating charge is invalid by operation of law. Any floating charge created during the relevant time period is automatically invalid, except to the extent of the value of the Consideration. However, if the floating charge is created or otherwise arising under a “security financial collateral arrangement” under the Financial Collateral Regulations, the floating charge will not be subject to challenge as described in “Administration” above. If a floating charge is held to be wholly invalid, then it will not be possible for the holder of that charge to appoint an administrator out of court or through the in-court route for qualifying floating charge holders or (if the holder would otherwise have been entitled to appoint an administrative receiver but for the floating charge being held invalid), to appoint an administrative receiver. 408 ----- _Recharacterisation of fixed charges_ As referred to above (see “—Fixed versus floating charges”), note the risk of a fixed charge being recharacterised as a floating charge. If purported fixed security that is subsequently recharacterised has been granted within the suspect period referred to above (see “—Voidable floating charges”), this could render the charge invalid except to the value of the Consideration. _Disclaimer_ An English liquidator has the power to disclaim onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract or other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, by serving the prescribed notice on the relevant party. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on a company that may be detrimental to creditors. A contract will not be unprofitable merely because it is financially disadvantageous or because the company could have made, or could make, a better bargain. However, this power to disclaim onerous property does not apply to an executed contract insofar as it has been performed, nor can it, except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from any liability, affect the rights or liabilities of any other person. Any person suffering loss or damage in consequence of the operation of the disclaimer is deemed to be a creditor of the company and may prove for the loss or damage in the winding-up.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

An equitable charge arises where a charging company creates an encumbrance over the property in favour of the chargee and/or transfers the beneficial interest in the property to the chargee but the charging company retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be subject to equitable considerations or may otherwise be at the discretion of the court. The validity of share security and the ability of secured parties to enforce security interests over shares may additionally be affected by a failure of the charging company or related parties or (in certain circumstances) the secured parties to comply within the relevant timeframes with the disclosure and notification obligations under English company statutes in respect of persons with significant control and relevant legal entities.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to the relevant English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank’s netting and set-off rights unless the Account Bank has expressly reserved set-off rights in such circumstances.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Among other requirements, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company’s memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that these documents do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor’s rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they 409 ----- are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith; however, the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question with respect to its entry into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in a way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the company for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found to be abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when this shift arises, the UK Supreme Court has held that it takes place when the company in question is either insolvent or is bordering on insolvency or an insolvent liquidation or administration is probable. Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to English company law. _Security registration_ Under English company law, subject to limited exceptions, a certified copy of any security document pursuant to which a charging company incorporated in England and Wales grants security (including security governed by law other than English law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest (the “Registration Period”). While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the Registration Period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English courts for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the Registration Period has expired. The Financial Collateral Regulations exempt certain charges over financial collateral from registration with the Registrar of Companies. Security created by overseas companies over assets in England and Wales similarly does not need to be registered with the Registrar of Companies, although registration with applicable asset registries may still be required depending on the nature of the collateral assets. _Moratoriums_ As outlined above, certain of the insolvency processes available in England and Wales provide for the automatic or optional moratorium imposing a period of time during which third parties including creditors are unable to institute or continue legal action against the company, enforce certain rights and/or call upon security or guarantees. Besides the moratorium available to companies undergoing administration (see “—Administration”) or liquidation (see “—Liquidation/winding-up”), a standalone moratorium procedure is also available (under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act) as introduced by the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 (“CIGA 2020”) to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act (subject to certain exclusions and meeting requisite conditions). Companies that are ineligible for the standalone moratorium include certain financial services companies (including banks, investment banks, insurance and securitisation companies as well as parties to any agreement which is or forms part of a “capital market arrangement” (including the grant of security or a guarantee) under which a party has incurred, or when the agreement was entered into was expected to incur, a debt of at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement), where the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment). This includes, among other things, secured and unsecured debt that is rated, listed, traded (or designed to be rated, listed or traded), or bonds or commercial paper issued to certain professional, high net worth or sophisticated investors. Other exclusions are set out in Schedule ZA1 to the Insolvency Act. The English Obligors are likely to fall outside the scope of being “eligible companies” for the purposes of the Part A1 moratorium by virtue of the capital markets arrangement exclusion. However, the Secretary of State for Business and Trade may modify the criteria by reference to which a company otherwise eligible for a moratorium is excluded from being so eligible. The position as to whether or not a company is an “eligible company” may also change from time to time. 410 ----- _Restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto provisions_ Recent changes to the Insolvency Act introduced a restriction on the operation and exercise of ipso facto clauses in order to preserve the continuity of the provision of goods and services to companies undergoing insolvency procedures. In general terms, ipso facto clauses are provisions in supply of goods or services contracts which allow suppliers to terminate the contract or supply or take any other action, or provide for the automatic termination of the contract or supply or the occurrence of any other event, upon the counterparty entering an insolvency procedure. Under the new approach, to the extent that the trigger event is the counterparty’s entry into a ‘relevant insolvency procedure’ (i.e. an administration, administrative receivership, company voluntary arrangement, liquidation, a moratorium under Part A1 of the Insolvency Act and/or a restructuring plan), such clauses will be deemed void and suppliers will be unable to terminate the relevant contracts unless the company or the relevant office-holder consents to the termination or the court grants permission on the basis that it is satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. The restrictions do not apply to a range of contracts involving financial services or entities involved in the provision of financial services, including contracts for the provision of lending, financial leasing or guarantees, contracts for the purchase, sale or loan of securities or commodities and agreements which are, or form part of, arrangements involving the issue of a capital market investment (as defined in the Insolvency Act).",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

One of the key insolvency-related treaties is the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency (the “Model Law”), which was implemented by the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations. The Model Law provides for recognition of certain British insolvency proceedings in other signatory states as either foreign main proceedings (if the COMI of the relevant debtor is determined to be in Great Britain) or foreign non-main proceedings (if the COMI is determined to be in another jurisdiction but the debtor has an establishment in Great Britain) upon application by the relevant insolvency officeholder. The nature and scope of the recognition will depend on the way that the Model Law has been implemented into the domestic law of the jurisdiction in question. Conversely, the Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations provide for recognition in Great Britain of foreign insolvency proceedings as either main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in the jurisdiction where the debtor has its COMI) or non-main proceedings (if the proceedings are taking place in a jurisdiction in which the debtor has only an establishment). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of schemes of arrangement, which are restructuring rather than insolvency proceedings, will be subject to treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention on Choice of Court Agreements 2005 (the “Hague Convention 2005”), where applicable. As of January 15, 2024, the UK Government has signed the Hague Convention of 2 July 2019 on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil or Commercial Matters (the “Hague Convention 2019”), which will come into force 12 months after ratification and apply to judgments in proceedings commenced after that date. In addition, recognition may still be available under principles of private international law and Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (“Rome I”). The recognition of English courts’ jurisdiction and orders in respect of restructuring plans is a developing area of law. It remains to be seen whether restructuring plans will fall within the scope of treaties regarding matters relating to the jurisdiction of courts in civil proceedings and the enforcement of civil judgments such as the Hague Convention 2005 (or the Hague Convention 2019), or whether they will be treated more akin to insolvency and restructuring proceedings and fall within related exceptions to such treaties. 411 ----- _Recognition in the EU_ Following the UK’s departure from the EU and the expiry of the Transition Period, UK proceedings no longer benefit from automatic and guaranteed recognition in EU member states. As the trade and cooperation terms agreed between the EU and the UK do not include a replacement regime for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU (and vice versa) or otherwise address insolvency matters, cross-border insolvencies involving the UK and one or more EU member states will be subject to a degree of uncertainty and increased complexity. Unless or until a mutual recognition agreement is reached and becomes effective in the future, it is likely to be more problematic for UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states and for UK office holders to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states than when the UK was a member state of the EU. The general position outlined above will apply and recognition will depend on the private international law rules adopted in the relevant EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk as well as costs. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder is made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than COMI rules, it is much less certain that such appointment will be recognised in other EU member states. To the extent relevant proceedings are deemed to fall within the remit of contract law, Rome I may offer an alternative basis for recognition in EU member states. As a consequence, the recognition of English insolvency and restructuring proceedings across the EU member states may be different from what investors may have experienced in the past when the UK was a member state of the EU. It is not possible to predict with certainty if and to what extent proceedings will be recognised and whether investors may be adversely affected as a result.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Unless insolvency proceedings or certain related proceedings were opened prior to the expiry of the Transition Period, in which case the unmodified Recast Insolvency Regulation and related EU insolvency legislation govern the proceedings, insolvency proceedings with respect to the English Obligors would likely proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency laws in force at the time of commencement of the relevant proceedings. However, to the extent that an English Obligor has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”) in a member state of the EU, main insolvency proceedings could, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation and subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the relevant EU member state and be subject to the laws of that EU member state. In addition, certain foreign courts may accept jurisdiction to oversee insolvency proceedings of an English Obligor where the relevant jurisdictional thresholds are met for that jurisdiction. Although the scope of the English courts’ jurisdiction varies for the different insolvency proceedings available in England and Wales, English courts generally have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in respect of any company which has its COMI in the UK or which has its COMI in an EU member state (other than Denmark) and an “establishment” in the UK or which is incorporated in an EEA Member State. While this allows English courts to assume jurisdiction over certain foreign companies in respect of certain insolvency proceedings, the efficacy of such proceedings will significantly depend on the likelihood and extent of subsequent recognition of such proceedings 395 ----- in relevant other jurisdictions (see “—Cross-border recognition of English insolvency and restructuring _proceedings”)._ English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. The obligations under the Senior Secured Notes are guaranteed by the Notes Guarantees and secured by security interests over the Collateral. English insolvency laws and other limitations could limit the enforceability of the payment obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in respect of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and of a Notes Guarantee against an English Obligor and of the security interests over the Collateral. The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to such limitations. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, and their ability to enforce their rights for payment of the principal, interest and other amounts owing by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and/or under the Notes Guarantees and/or under the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of an English Obligor.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

We therefore refer you to the English law sections above in relation to security and guarantees granted by English Guarantors in all respects, save for those specifically dealt with below in relation to Scottish fixed security. In Scotland, forms of fixed security are closely tied to specific types of property. Since Scots law does not recognise the English law concept of “equity” there is more focus on the legal formalities rather than the intention of the parties with respect to the creation of fixed security interests. Scots law does not have a concept of recharacterisation of fixed security as a floating charge (as detailed in “—Fixed versus floating charges”) and so if the strict legal requirements under Scots law are not met, there will be no security over the relevant assets notwithstanding the intention of the parties. In respect of movable property, it is essential that the security holder has some form of possession (which may take different forms) over the subject in order to create a valid fixed security interest. Scots law does not differentiate between legal and equitable ownership of property so, for instance, in order to create a security interest over shares in companies incorporated in Scotland, the security holder (or its nominee) must be registered as the shareholder. Furthermore, as there is no Scottish equivalent of an English law equitable assignment, a Scottish interest in incorporeal property will only be created when the assignation is properly notified to the relevant parties. Fixed charges over land and buildings situated in Scotland may only be created using a “standard security” (which is the Scots law equivalent of a legal mortgage over an interest of land and is governed by statute, including in relation to how the security must be enforced). Scots law does not recognise the office of receiver except in the specific instance of a receiver appointed by, or on the application of, the holder of a floating charge created as such by a company with such appointments or applications being subject to the restrictions noted in the sections above relating to English Guarantors (see in particular “—Administrative receivership”). Rather, enforcement of a standard security over land and buildings in Scotland is by a procedure called ‘calling up’ which requires a prescribed form notice to be given to the granter of the security (and certain other prescribed parties) providing the debtor with a two-month period to make repayment of the secured liabilities referred to in the notice (the two-month period can be shortened in certain circumstances). Where the secured property is used to any extent for residential purposes, additional requirements need to be complied with 412 ----- including a pre-action protocol and an application to Court. Calling up only entitles the secured creditor to advertise and sell the property secured by the standard security. It does not provide the secured creditor with control over, or, any rights in relation to the wider assets of the debtor and/or its business carried on from the property. The process also exposes the secured creditor to potential liabilities. In an insolvency situation, the insolvency practitioner would usually sell the property secured by the standard security with the consent of the secured creditor. However, in the absence of insolvency proceedings, calling up would be the route through which the secured creditor would require to enforce its standard security. Whilst a liquidator appointed in England has the power to disclaim onerous contracts and property, the position is not settled whether a liquidator under English law governed insolvency proceedings can disclaim onerous heritable property situated in Scotland on the basis the concept of disclaimer does not exist under Scots law.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Under insolvency laws in Northern Ireland, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges because the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer’s position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Senior Secured Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on such Senior Secured Notes, regardless of the holder’s method of accounting, and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognised on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note. The balance of this discussion assumes that the Senior Secured Notes will not be considered 420 ----- contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Senior Secured Notes of the contingent payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.4,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,62.4.3,Payments of Stated Interest,"Payments of stated interest on a Senior Secured Note (including additional amounts paid in respect of withholding taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income of a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognise interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. A cash basis U.S. holder will not realise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest but may recognise exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognised with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognise income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate of exchange in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder’s taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Senior Secured Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognise foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.-source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.4,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,62.4.4,Original Issue Discount,"The Senior Secured Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Senior Secured Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event of the Senior Secured Notes are issued with OID, U.S. holders of the Senior Secured Notes generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, such U.S. holders generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The amount of any OID with respect to a Senior Secured Note includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Senior Secured Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Senior Secured Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Senior Secured Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Senior Secured Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Senior Secured Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of such accrual period and its “yield to maturity,” determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly 421 ----- adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Senior Secured Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Senior Secured Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Senior Secured Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. OID, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under “—Payments of Stated Interest.” A U.S. holder of a Senior Secured Note will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of such Senior Secured Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on such Senior Secured Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Senior Secured Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the Senior Secured Notes as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain or loss rules.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,62,CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS,62.4,Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations,62.4.5,Foreign Tax Credit,"Payments of stated interest generally will be income from sources outside the United States and, depending on the U.S. holder’s circumstances, will generally be considered “passive” category income for purposes of the rules regarding the foreign tax credit (or at such holder’s election, a deduction in lieu of such credit). If any non-U.S. income tax were withheld or paid in respect of payments on the Senior Secured Notes at the rate applicable to a U.S. holder, such holder may be eligible for foreign tax credits (or, at the election of such holder, a deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk requirements). There are significant complex limitations on a U.S. holder’s ability to claim foreign tax credits. Recently issued final U.S. Treasury Regulations have imposed additional requirements that must be met for a foreign tax to be creditable. However, a recent notice from the IRS indicates that the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the IRS are considering proposing amendments to such Regulations and allows, subject to certain conditions, taxpayers to defer the application of many aspects of such Regulations for taxable years beginning on or after December 28, 2021 and ending before the date that a notice or other guidance withdrawing or modifying the temporary relief is issued (or any later date specified in such notice or other guidance).

The cost of a Senior Secured Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the spot rate of exchange in effect on that date. If the Senior Secured Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Senior Secured Note at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. The conversion of U.S. dollars to a foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase a Senior Secured Note generally will not result in taxable gain or loss for a U.S. holder. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognise gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realised (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s method of tax accounting as described above to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and the U.S. holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Senior Secured Note. The amount realised 422 ----- on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note for an amount of foreign currency generally will be the U.S. dollar value of that amount based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of taxable disposition. If the Senior Secured Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognise exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognised by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the principal thereof, generally will be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Senior Secured Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder’s purchase price of the Senior Secured Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Senior Secured Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, accrued OID (which will be treated as discussed above under “—Payments of Stated Interest” or “—Original Issue _Discount,” as applicable) will be recognised only to the extent of the total gain or loss realised by the U.S. holder on_ the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Senior Secured Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Any gain or loss recognised by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognised on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Senior Secured Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Senior Secured Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. If any such gain is subject to foreign income tax, U.S. holders may not be able to credit such tax against their U.S. federal income tax liability, unless such income tax can be credited (subject to applicable limitations) against U.S. federal income tax due on other income treated as derived from foreign sources. Alternatively, the U.S. holder may deduct such taxes in computing taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that the U.S. holder does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for any foreign income taxes paid or accrued for the relevant taxable year. In the case of a non-corporate U.S. holder (including an individual), net long-term capital gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates compared to items of ordinary income if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilising transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying Senior Secured Note so long as the stabilising bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Senior Secured Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Senior Secured Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilising or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the Offering, Barclays Bank PLC (the “Stabilisation Manager”), or one of its affiliates or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilise, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Senior Secured Notes. Specifically, the Stabilisation Manager, or one of its affiliates or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Senior Secured Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Senior Secured Notes. The Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot either the Offering (which involves sales in excess of the offering size), creating a short position for the Initial Purchasers, and may bid for and purchase Senior Secured Notes in the open market to cover such short position. In addition, the Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Senior Secured Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. This occurs when a particular Initial Purchaser repays to the Initial Purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, have repurchased Senior Secured Notes sold by or for the account of such Initial Purchaser in stabilising or short covering transactions. These activities may stabilise 434 ----- or maintain the respective market price of the Senior Secured Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilisation Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Senior Secured Notes. These stabilising transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Senior Secured Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time without notice at the sole discretion of the Stabilisation Manager. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar days after the Issue Date and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the Senior Secured Notes.

In addition, the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hold Existing Senior Secured Notes, which are subject to the Richmond Tender Offer described under “Summary—Richmond Tender Offer.” Therefore, they may (i) tender and receive consideration for any such Existing Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the terms of the Richmond Tender Offer, or (ii) otherwise receive payment in connection with the repayment of any Existing Senior Secured Notes at their stated maturity or First Optional Par Redemption Date, as applicable, in each case funded with the net proceeds of the New Financing, including the Offering. Barclays Bank PLC is acting as dealer manager in connection with the Richmond Tender Offer. In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its affiliates, including the Senior Secured Notes, the Existing Senior Secured Notes and the Existing Senior Notes. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may receive allocations of the Senior Secured Notes (subject to customary closing 435 ----- conditions), which could affect future trading of the Senior Secured Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its respective affiliates routinely hedge their credit exposure to them, and the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may in the future otherwise act as hedge counterparties to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries, in each case consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the securities of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer its subsidiaries, including potentially the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Senior Secured Notes offered hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to partners that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments. 436 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The audit report of KPMG LLP for the years ended December 31, 2023, which is included in this Offering Memorandum, includes a statement, in accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, that KPMG LLP does not assume responsibility to anyone (including holders of the Senior Secured Notes) other than the Group and the Group’s members as a body, for its audit work, audit reports or opinions it has formed. KPMG LLP has undertaken its audit work, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, to state to the Group’s members those matters that it is required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.

Investors in the Senior Secured Notes should understand that these statements are intended to disclaim any liability to parties (such as purchasers of the Senior Secured Notes) other than to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its subsidiaries with respect to those reports. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the limitation above, the recourse that investors in the Senior Secured Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which auditors have responsibility or liability to third parties is unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, and the legal effect of these statements in the audit reports is untested in the context of an offering of securities. The inclusion of the language referred to above, however, may limit the ability of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to bring any action against our auditors for damages arising out of an investment in the Senior Secured Notes. 438 -----",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.1,England and Wales and Scotland,215.1.1,,"The United Kingdom does not currently have a treaty with the United States providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States. based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognised or enforceable in England and Wales or in Scotland. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales or Scotland, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales or Scotland (as applicable). In such an action, the courts of England and Wales or Scotland would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is described below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment (or summary decree in Scotland) on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). Summary judgment is a procedure by which the courts of England and Wales or Scotland can dispose of all or part of a claim without proceeding to a full trial. Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a court of England and Wales or Scotland in such an action is conditional upon (among others) the following: - the U.S. court having had, at the time when proceedings were served, jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to the private international law rules of England and Wales or Scottish rules of private international law (in other words, it does not matter that the U.S. court had jurisdiction according to its own law, but instead whether it had jurisdiction according to the private international law rules of England and Wales or Scotland); - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; and - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a penalty or fine or otherwise based on a U.S. law that court of England and Wales or Scotland court considers to relate to penal, revenue or other public law. A court of England and Wales or Scotland may refuse to enforce such a judgment if the judgment debtor satisfies the court that: - the U.S. judgment contravenes the public policy of England and Wales or Scotland or the European Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998 (or any subordinate legislation made thereunder, to the extent applicable); - the U.S. judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained, is otherwise specified in Section 5 of the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 or is based on measures designated by the Secretary of State under Section 1 of the Act; - the U.S. judgment has been obtained by fraud or in breach of the principles of natural or substantial justice of England and Wales or Scotland; - the U.S. judgment is a judgment on a matter previously determined by a court or another court of England and Wales or Scotland whose judgment is entitled to recognition in England and Wales or Scotland or conflicts with an earlier judgment of such court; 440 ----- - the enforcement proceedings in England and Wales or Scotland were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; or - the U.S. judgment was obtained contrary to an agreement for the resolution of disputes under which the dispute in question was to be resolved otherwise than by proceedings in a United States court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit). Only subject to the foregoing may investors be able to enforce judgments in England and Wales or Scotland that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. Notwithstanding the preceding, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognised or enforceable in England and Wales or Scotland. In addition, we cannot assure you whether a court of England and Wales or Scotland would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England and Wales or Scotland, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws. The foregoing assumes that such enforcement action takes place outside of any bankruptcy or insolvency process: it may not be possible to obtain a judgment in England and Wales or Scotland or to enforce the judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings. Finally, note that, in any enforcement proceedings, the judgment debtor may raise any set off or counterclaim that could have been brought if the action had been originally brought in England and Wales or Scotland unless the subject of the counterclaim was in issue and denied in the U.S. proceedings. If an English or Scottish court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English or Scottish judgment will be enforceable by any methods generally available for this purpose. However, the courts of England and Wales and Scotland have discretion to grant a stay/sist of enforcement if an appeal against the U.S. judgment is pending with a higher court in the United States.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Any judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities law, would not be directly enforceable in Northern Ireland. In order to enforce such a monetary judgment in Northern Ireland, under common law rules proceedings must be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a Northern Irish Court. Summary judgment may be applied for and in this type of action, a Northern Irish court generally will not (subject to among other things, the matters identified below) reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court if: - the relevant U.S. court had territorial, procedural and substantive jurisdiction (under the UK rules of private international law applicable to Northern Ireland) to give the judgment; and - the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or otherwise based on a U.S. law that a Northern Irish Court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public law). A Northern Irish court may refuse to enforce such a judgment for reasons including if it is established that: - the enforcement of such judgment would contravene natural justice, public policy or statute in Northern Ireland; - the enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the amount of the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained); - the Northern Irish proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; - before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had been the subject of a final judgment of a Northern Irish Court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is enforceable in Northern Ireland; 441 ----- - the judgment has been obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles of natural justice were breached; - the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit); or - an order has been made and remains effective under section 9 of the UK Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933, applying that section to U.S. courts, including the relevant U.S. court. If a Northern Irish Court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the Northern Irish judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain a Northern Irish judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is or becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Notwithstanding the above there can be no assurance that any judgment described will be recognised or enforceable in Northern Ireland. In addition there can be no assurance that a Northern Irish Court will accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Northern Ireland, instead of the United States, and predicated solely on US federal securities law.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts of laws principles; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money (although there are circumstances where non-money judgments may also be recognised); - the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine; - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in breach of Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended to Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983); - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural justice or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same matter.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting policies. The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundreds of thousands of pounds (£0.1m) except where otherwise stated. As described in the Strategic Report, the main activities of the Group are the retailing of food, food service, clothing, general merchandise products, fuel and services throughout the United Kingdom and online. The key risks and opportunities arising from climate change are detailed in the Non-financial and Sustainability Information Statement in the Strategic Report. These have been informed by the Group’s risk identification process, as described in the Principal Risks and Uncertainties section. The risk assessment indicates that the potential exposure to climate risks in the near-term is very limited, with lower to moderate potential risks in the medium term. Management will continue to monitor climate-related risks, and any potential impact on the financial position of the Group, as they evolve in future periods, through its risk management processes. Further detail is provided in note 15 of how the expected transition to alternative fuel vehicles is expected to impact on the Group’s future cashflows, and how this has been taken into account in the impairment tests performed in relation to the Group’s long-lived assets. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

In assessing the Group’s ability to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have reviewed the Group's annual corporate planning process which includes profitability, cashflow and liquidity forecasting and have based their projections for the going concern period on the FY24 plan and extrapolated forecasts for a period covering 12 months after approval of the financial statements. The Group’s Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring forecasts of the Group’s cash flows and maintaining a sufficient level of standby facilities via the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF). Any capital repayments of long-term financing are forecast in the cash flow model used in the going concern scenarios. There are no significant maturities of the Group’s long-term financing arrangements during the going concern period. The Directors continue to assess how to best manage these medium-term and long term maturities through maintaining adequate standby facilities or refinancing to ensure the Group maintains a long-term sustainable capital structure. The Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn at the year end and no utilisation is forecasted in the base case cash flow model for the going concern period. For more information on liquidity risk and maturity of financial liabilities see note 21. In assessing the Group’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have tested the ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due during the going concern period, in the event of various cash flow scenarios, including a severe but plausible downside scenario. This scenario applies severe but plausible economic downsides to our base case forecast, modelling the impact of a sales decline due to a significant shift in market share, change in consumer preferences, major business disruption or a reputational incident, alongside the risk of fuel margin decline, inflationary pressures and risk of not achieving forecast levels of cost transformation activities. Mitigating actions that are in the control of management have been considered such as reducing non-essential capital expenditure and discretionary spend. These mitigating actions are not required to be implemented to ensure sufficient headroom in the severe but plausible downside scenario. The Directors consider that a scenario with no mitigating actions is not realistic as all modelled mitigating actions are readily accessible. The Group is subject to a maintenance covenant whereby the senior secured net leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.90:1. This covenant is required to be tested if, as at the quarter end, drawings on the RCF exceed 40% of the facility. The Directors have also considered whether the above scenarios trigger the requirement to test the Group’s financial covenant and have confirmed that there would be no requirement to test financial covenants under the cashflow scenarios modelled during the going concern period. The model has been reverse stress tested to determine the level of sales and margin decline that would erode remaining headroom and lead to the Group breaching the level of available facilities or covenants. The Directors consider that the likelihood of such a significant deterioration of cash flows or profitability is remote. On the basis of these assessments, the Directors can conclude it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) The financial statements for the period ended 31 December 2021 have been prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have determined that the Group has sufficient resources and liquidity facilities to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the period from the date of approval of the accounts up to 31 December 2023. In assessing the Group’s ability to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have tested the ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due from the date of approval of the accounts up to 31 December 2023, in the event of various cash flow scenarios, including a severe but plausible downside scenario. This scenario applies severe but plausible economic downsides to our base case forecast, modelling the impact of a decline of the Group’s participation in the UK grocery market alongside the risk of continued food inflation. Furthermore, the Directors have considered the likely impacts on the business of increased levels of political instability and uncertainty arising out of external events which have occurred subsequent to the balance sheet date and are ongoing at the date of approval of the financial statements. The Directors are satisfied that the potential economic impacts of these events are adequately taken into account in the severe but plausible downside scenario. Mitigating actions that are in the control of management have been considered such as reducing non-essential capital expenditure and discretionary spend. The model has been reverse stress tested to determine the extent of deterioration of cash flows that would lead to the Group breaching the level of available facilities. The Directors consider that such a significant deterioration of cash flows is implausible. At the date of approval of the accounts, the Directors are satisfied that in the event of the severe but plausible downside scenario occurring, the Group would meet its liabilities as they fall due up to 31 December 2023.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

In particular, the Directors have reassessed the application of the IAS 36 with respect to the following stages of the impairment review: - Identifying CGUs which exhibit impairment triggers; - Calculating the carrying value of Cash Generating Units (“CGUs”) which are tested for impairment; and, - Calculating value-in-use (“VIU”) as part of determining the recoverable amount of CGUs _Identifying Cash Generating Units (CGUs) which exhibit impairment triggers_ In previous years, the Directors applied judgement when assessing which indicators to use in the identification of CGUs exhibiting impairment triggers. CGUs were considered to exhibit indicators of impairment where their rolling twelve-month cashflows were negative and where this was the case the Directors would assess the recoverable amount of the CGU. Following the review undertaken during the year, the Directors have adopted additional indicators, both qualitative and quantitative, to broaden the assessment of impairment triggers. These indicators now include the following: a) Negative cashflows generated by CGUs in the preceding twelve months b) Adverse cashflow performance against budget and year-on-year cashflow deterioration c) Specific CGU qualitative factors such as environmental damage and store closure In relation to a), the Directors have updated the method of allocating central costs when determining the net cashflows generated by a CGU. In previous years, cashflows generated by CGUs were calculated by allocating only those central costs which were deemed to be variable and incrementally generated by those CGUs - notably variable distribution costs incurred in delivering goods to stores. Following the review undertaken during the year, all relevant central costs incurred by the Group have been allocated to CGUs as part of the calculation of the cashflows generated by CGUs in the preceding twelve months. This has significantly increased the number of CGUs exhibiting quantitative impairment triggers compared to previous years. _Calculating the carrying value of CGUs which are tested for impairment_ As detailed in the significant judgements and estimates section of note 1 to the accounts, the Directors consider that each store site constitutes a CGU for the purposes of impairment testing as each store site generates cashflows independently from other store sites. During the year, the Directors have reconsidered how the carrying value of central assets (for example, the carrying value of long-lived assets relating to the Group’s distribution centres and home offices) is allocated to CGUs. In previous years, the carrying value of central assets was not allocated to CGUs but was tested for impairment by estimating the recoverable amount of the Group’s long-lived asset base as a whole by reference to the aggregate cashflows and fair value of the business as a whole. As part of the review undertaken during the year, the Directors have determined that central assets can be allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis prior to testing those CGUs for impairment by reference to revenue by CGU. _Calculating value-in-use (“VIU”) as part of determining the recoverable amount of CGUs_ In addition, in tandem with the review of the allocation of central assets to CGUs, the Directors have also determined that central costs can also be allocated to CGUs on a reasonable and consistent basis when determining the cashflows which are generated by CGUs by reference to revenue by CGU. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

In addition, the Directors now also allocate working capital movements in determining the forecast cashflows used in VIU calculations. _Impact on Financial Statements of the change in how the Group applies the requirements of IAS 36_ Given that the changes adopted during the year by the Group in relation to how IAS 36 is applied has increased the number of CGUs to be tested; reducing the cashflows generated by CGUs in the preceding twelve months; and of reducing the VIU of those CGUs for which impairment testing is performed, and after considering the fair value of each CGU, these changes have resulted in a material increase in the pre-tax cumulative impairment charge recorded by the Group at 31 December 2023 compared to the cumulative impairment charge that would have been recorded under the previous application of the accounting standard. As set out in note 5, the cumulative net impairment charge for the years ended 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2023 is £151.7m (post-tax £128.8m). The Directors have considered the guidance set out in IAS 8 - Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors and have also taken account of the stated objective of financial statements as set out in IAS 1 - Presentation of Financial Statements to provide information about the financial position and financial performance of an entity which is useful to a wide range of users. As the reassessment of the Group’s application of IAS 36 has been applied in order to provide readers with more reliable information about the carrying value of the Group’s long-lived assets at the balance sheet date, the Directors have applied judgement to conclude that the effect of the revised allocation of central costs to both the assessment of impairment triggers and the forecast cashflows used in the VIU calculations and the allocation of central assets to CGUs should be applied to the impairment review conducted at 31 December 2022. The Directors have also carried out the same impairment review at 31 December 2021 and concluded that no changes in presentation are required as there were no significant changes in the property values in the period since the acquisition of the Asda in February 2021 to the year end. This results in a pre-tax impairment charge for the year ended 31 December 2022 of £377.4m (post-tax £312.2m) of which £357.5m (pre-tax) was not previously recorded in the 2022 financial statements. As this amount results from a change in application of the requirements of IAS 36, the Directors have recorded a prior year adjustment as per the requirements of IAS 8. Further detail regarding Group accounting policies in relation to impairment are provided in note 1 and further detail relating to impairment charges recorded during the current and prior year is provided in notes 12 and 13. A summary of how the above prior year restatements have impacted the Consolidated Income Statement and Consolidated Balance Sheet for the year ended 31 December 2022 is set out below. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) On 30 May 2023, when the CMA accepted the Group’s undertaking which involved divesting of 13 petrol filling stations, restrictions imposed under the IEO were lifted by the CMA. Upon lifting of the IEO, the Group was able to direct relevant activities to affect the returns to be generated from Arthur Foodstores. From that date, the Directors have concluded that the Group has met the conditions set out in IFRS 10 to establish control over Arthur Foodstores and as such, the results of the Arthur business are consolidated within the Group financial statements in the current year from that date. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) _Business combinations - acquisition date relating to the Group's purchase of the share capital of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited_ On 31 October 2023 Project America Bidco Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco PLC, completed its acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Ltd (“EGJL”), comprising the majority of EG Group’s UK business. The business is a fuel, grocery and foodservice retailer operating throughout the United Kingdom. The business was acquired for consideration of £2.025bn on a debt-free basis, without any restrictions placed on the group by the CMA. The Directors considered the criteria set out in IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ required to establish control over a subsidiary which are as follows and all need to be met to consolidate an investee as a subsidiary for in the consolidated financial statements: (a) Power over the investee, for example through voting or other rights; (b) Exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement in the investee; and (c) The ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the Group’s returns. There were no restrictions on the Group’s ability to direct the relevant activities of the EGJL business as at and subsequent to the 31 October 2023. Therefore, the results of EGJL have been consolidated since 31 October 2023 as this was the date that the Group gained control of the business. IFRS 3R ‘Business Combinations’ requires the acquiror to determine whether there are any pre-existing arrangements between the acquiror and acquiree which were entered into before negotiations for the business combination began, or whether there are arrangements entered into during the negotiations for acquisition which do not form part of the business combination for the purposes of acquisition accounting. EGJL was a related party of the Group prior to entering into the negotiations for the business combination and there were already pre-existing trading relationships and real estate leases in place between the Group and the acquiree before negotiations for the business combination began. None of these arrangements included any settlement provisions. These arrangements are detailed in Note 30. The Directors have assessed the terms of these arrangements at the acquisition date and concluded that they were on current market terms. As such, the consideration and total identifiable net assets acquired have not been adjusted to reflect these pre-existing relationships. At completion, the Group entered into a number of arrangements with EG Finco Limited, including a Transitional Services Agreement (TSA) and an integration support arrangement. These arrangements were all negotiated concurrently with the acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited. Directors have concluded that these arrangements are not part of the business combination and therefore, have been accounted for separately from the business combination. The Directors are required to identify the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of the business combination and perform fair value assessments of these assets and liabilities. Fair value measurements are estimates of the amounts for which assets or liabilities could be transferred at the acquisition date, based on the assumption that such transfers take place between participants in principal markets and, where applicable, taking highest and best use into account. These valuations therefore require the Directors to make estimates of the fair value of these assets and liabilities using appropriate valuation techniques, including acquired property, related tangible assets and identified intangible assets. The valuation methodologies adopted for the valuation of property, related tangible assets, intangible assets and short term leases are outlined below: ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) _Freehold and long-leasehold property and leasehold improvements_ Freehold and long-leasehold properties have been valued using an income capitalisation approach to value the assets. These are trading properties and as such the assets have been valued as fully equipped operational entities. The rental values and property yields for the units vary according to the location and trading potential of the properties. The values have been arrived at by analysing historic trading data and considering comparable transactional evidence. In assessing the rental value of the properties, the Directors have had regard to the trading history of the properties, economic market conditions and arrived at a considered opinion of fair and maintainable trading performance. The fair values for the long leasehold properties exclude the lease liability but do reflect the unexpired lease term. Leasehold improvements have been valued based on depreciated replacement cost. _Investment properties_ Investment properties have been valued using an income capitalisation approach which reflects the unexpired lease term followed by a reversion with no contracted income at the valuation date. The reversionary value reflects the estimated rental values for the individual units as opposed contractual rent under the leases. The rental values and property yields for the units vary according to the location and trading potential of the properties. The properties have been valued individually rather than as a portfolio. Investment properties assumed as part of the acquisition are freehold properties where the group has entered into lease arrangements with subsidiaries of EG Finco Limited. These lease arrangements are underwritten by a guarantee from EG Finco Limited. _Short term leases_ Short term leases have been valued based on an income approach, whereby the differential between contractual rent and market rent is calculated up to the concluded lease expiry date and discounted back to calculate net present value lease favourability or unfavourability. _Intangible assets_ The intangible asset relating to the LEON brand has been valued using the relief from royalty approach. The brand intangible has been assumed to have useful life of 20 years. _Accounting for leases as a lessor_ The Group has entered into a number of lease arrangements with subsidiaries of EG Finco Limited at completion relating to properties owned or leased by the Group, including freehold properties which have been valued as investment properties. The classification of these lease arrangements as either operating or finance leases has been assessed in accordance with IFRS 16. For the freehold properties which are investment properties, the value of the properties and minimum lease payments have been bifurcated between the land and buildings and assessed separately. The lease of the land has been classified as operating leases and the fair value of the land recognised as investment properties on acquisition. The lease of the buildings has been classified as finance leases and a finance lease receivable equivalent to the net investment in the lease has been recognised on acquisition. Where the properties are leased by the group, the sub-lease has been assessed as to whether it should be classified as a finance lease or operating lease at acquisition by reference to the related right of use asset. Where the arrangements provide for the sub-lease to be back-to-back with the headlease such that the payments under the headlease are passed through to the lessee and the sub-lease is for the remaining term of the headlease, the leases have been classified as finance leases. Consequently, at acquisition, the right of use asset has been derecognised and a finance lease receivable recognised based on the net investment in the lease at acquisition. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) _IFRS 16 lease term_ IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the period covered by options to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option, and the period covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise the option. The Group applies judgement to whether an extension should be added to the non-cancellable lease term with reference to the following: - Extension options in the contract. Consideration as to whether any option is reasonably certain to be exercised is based on whether an economic incentive exists to do so. This incentive is assessed by reference to multiple factors including but not limited to current operational performance of the site and future performance projections, length of time to the option exercise date and future capital requirements. The majority of the Group's leases do not have extension options in the contract but, where they do, most lease terms include the extension period. - Geographical factors. A term extension on any lease for sites in England and Wales may be judged reasonably certain on the basis of security of tenure if an economic incentive to remain in the lease beyond the contractual term is deemed to exist. This incentive is assessed by reference to the same factors listed above. If an extension is judged reasonably certain, the typical additional term applied is 10 years. Geographical factors are not considered for sites outside England and Wales. In the event of changing circumstances or new information that may impact judgements taken, lease terms will be re-assessed on a lease by lease basis. Term reassessments are identified on an ad-hoc basis in light of new or updated information which would impact the assumptions originally recognised. Any change in lease term could result in a recalculation of the lease liability and a material adjustment to the associated right-of-use asset. There were two examples of term reassessment in 2023 which led to a £9.7m reduction in the right-of-use asset and £10.1m reduction in the lease liability (2022: nil). ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) _IFRS 16 discount rate_ IFRS 16 requires that lease liabilities are discounted at the interest rate implicit in a lease, or where this isn’t available, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The majority of the Group’s leases do not include an interest rate implicit in the lease, and therefore the incremental borrowing rate is utilised to calculate these lease liabilities. The incremental borrowing rate is considered a key judgement and under IFRS 16 reflects the rate of interest a lessee would incur to borrow over a similar term, with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value in a similar economic environment. We consider the following factors in determining the incremental borrowing rate: - The risk free rate of return in the UK market; and, - The credit risk spread which reflects the additional risks associated with lending specifically to the Group, taking account of factors such as our credit rating, the term of the lease, and the geographic location. The risk free rate is observable in the market and is the base of our calculation, however there is significant judgement in determining the additional credit risk spread specific to the Group on the basis that there is limited market observable data on which to make this judgement, particularly for lease terms in excess of 10 years. As a result we utilise rates from other geographical regions (e.g. US) for companies with a similar credit rating where there is more market observable data on which to base our judgement. The geographical locations utilised, alongside the specific data selected for inclusion are considered a key judgement. Due to the extent of the Group’s lease portfolio, small changes in discount rate can significantly impact the accounting recognition and could result in a material difference to the right-of-use asset, lease liability, and associated depreciation and interest charge recognised in the Income Statement. Further, the Group has leases for a wide range of different terms, from 1 year to in excess of 100 years. Judgement is used by the Group to apply a cap of 30 years to the discount rate on the basis that data relating to loans for terms in excess of 30 years is rare and as such, no more reliable rate than a 30 year rate can be determined. The Group also applies judgement in determining the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis. Management have asserted that by updating the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis, we ensure that the discount rate used remains relevant, current and materially correct. Should events and conditions change in the interim period we would consider whether the discount rate should be updated on a more frequent basis. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) _Supply Chain Finance_ Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be classified as trade payables or as another line item on the Balance Sheet. In determining the classification, the Group reviews each arrangement against a number of characteristics to assess whether the substance of liabilities owed by the Group to the participating banks under the contractual terms of the arrangements is consistent with other trade payables. These include: - Whether participation in the schemes is voluntary for suppliers; - Whether the Group is involved in the negotiations and agreements between the banks and suppliers or tri-partite agreements exist; - Whether payment terms have been extended outside industry norms for trade payables; - Whether interest is accrued on outstanding balances or fees are receivable by the Group; - Whether the banks require parent guarantees in respect of the Group’s obligations; - Whether the Group retains its rights to offset credits or withhold payment. The nature of the Group’s liabilities under supply chain financing arrangements when considering these characteristics supports classification of amounts owed by the Group under its supply chain financing arrangements as trade payables. Accordingly, purchases of goods under supply chain financing arrangements are recognised within operating costs and settlement of liabilities under supply chain financing arrangements are classified as operating cashflows (see note 21 for amounts utilised under supply chain finance agreements). _Litigation_ Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance with IAS 37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters are made in relation to contingent liabilities (see note 29). _Estimates Estimates in the business combination_ Forecasts of future performance of the acquired business are utilised in the calculation of the fair value of assets acquired. The group uses third party valuation specialists to calculate the fair value of intangibles and property, plant and equipment who use these forecasts as an input into the valuations. For leasehold properties the fair value of right-of-use assets is determined using market rentals, determined with the support of property surveyors, these market rentals are discounted based on an IFRS 16 discount rate as that date of acquisition. As noted in the ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’ section above, there is inherent judgement included in the determination of the appropriate discount rate. _Impairment of non-financial assets_ The Group tests intangibles (including goodwill) and other non-current assets for impairment as discussed in notes 12, 13 and 15. Forecast cashflows are used in the impairment models and estimates of long term growth rates are identified to extrapolate cashflows past the 3 year planning horizon. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) _Estimation of store inventory losses_ Adjustments to store inventory are recorded based on the results of physical inventory counts, which are performed throughout the year by an independent third party. Store inventory losses arising between the dates of physical counts and the balance sheet date are estimated and provided for as a percentage of sales arising between physical inventory counts. The provision is recorded on store-by-store basis and takes into account several factors - most notably the most recent physical inventory count result of the store analysed by trading department, and wider trends in store inventory loss experienced by the Group. During the year, taking into account recent experience of trends in inventory loss observed by the Group and the wider retail industry, the Directors have updated the estimation basis for store inventory loss provisions at the Balance Sheet date from a three count average to being based on the most recent physical count. The provision for store inventory loss at 31 December 2023 is £140.2m (2022: £95.9m). As a result of updating the estimation basis for store inventory loss as described above, the Group has recognised a charge to operating costs of £33.8m during the year. This is included in cost of goods sold in the table disclosed in note 5. At 31 December 2023, an increase in the inventory loss provision amounting to 0.01% of sales since the most recent physical count of each store would increase the provision for inventory loss at 31 December 2023 by £1.0m. _Deferred gains and losses relating to sale-and-leaseback transaction_ The Group estimates the gain or loss on sale to be recognised in the Income Statement based on the amount of the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The remaining gain or loss is deferred as a reduction or increase to the right-of-use asset relating to the leaseback. This estimate requires determining the fair value of the properties transferred and calculating the lease liability of the leaseback. As noted in the ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’ section above, there is inherent judgement included in the determination of the appropriate discount rate. The fair value of properties transferred is determined using third party valuation specialists. Please see further detail on financial amounts in note 10. _Right-of-use Assets_ Right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day (including lease buy out payments made to previous tenants) less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term. If the lease includes an option to transfer ownership of the underlying asset, or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. Depreciation is charged from the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the ‘Impairment of non-financial assets' policy above. _Non-lease components and variable rent expense_ As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has taken this election with the exception of IT and printer leases where other charges included in the contract (maintenance and replenishment) are accounted for separately within related cost lines. The primary non-lease components recognised within lease payments are property costs (service charges and insurances) paid to landlords and included within the terms of lease contracts. These costs are included within the lease payments at commencement date if fixed, or within variable rent expense as incurred if not. The majority of these payments are variable and therefore not included in the lease liability. As a lessee, the Group does not have any rent payment terms linked to sales or other variable metrics. For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. All of the Group’s hedges are considered to be cash flow hedges, hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments (refer to note 21 for further details). In addition, the Group uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk, floating interest rate risk relating to its foreign currency borrowings and interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to floating interest rate risk relating to a proportion of the Apollo facility, which is a variable rate sterling term loan. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. For hedges of foreign currency purchases the gain or loss is recognised within cost of inventories. For cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps, the gain or loss is recognised in finance costs or finance income. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated Income Statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement. _Non-interest-bearing financial liabilities_ The Group’s non-interest-bearing financial liabilities include trade and other payables and intercompany payables, which are recognised at amortised cost. _Interest-bearing borrowings_ The Group’s interest-bearing borrowings include intercompany borrowings and external borrowings and are recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or losses arising on repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income or finance costs. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities except for those with contractual maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date. _Offsetting of financial instruments_ Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. _Fair values_ Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) _Wholesale revenue - Fuel_ The Group acts as an agent on behalf of certain wholesale partners in the procurement of fuel for sale in the retail outlets of those partners. Under these arrangements, fuel is delivered directly to the retail outlets of the wholesale partners by third party suppliers. The Group settles liabilities to third party fuel suppliers in respect of these purchases and is reimbursed by wholesale partners for payments to the third-party suppliers, including a commission. The Group does not take physical ownership of fuel delivered to wholesale partners through these arrangements, has no direct involvement in the distribution of the fuel inventory between the third-party suppliers and the wholesale partners and assumes no inventory risk. Due to the nature of these arrangements, the Directors consider that the Group is acting as an agent and accordingly, revenue is recognised on a net basis according to the value of the commission received by the Group from the wholesale partners, excluding VAT. Commission revenue is recognised at the point that the Group determines that the third-party suppliers have delivered fuel to the sites of the wholesale partners as that it the point at which the Group recognises a liability to the third-party supplier for the fuel and simultaneously is the point at which the Group becomes entitled to reimbursement by the wholesale partner. As such, that is the point at which the directors determine that the Group has satisfied its contractual performance obligations to the wholesale partners. Since the Group established control over its principal wholesale partner - Euro Garages Limited - on 31 October 2023, commission revenue recognised in revenue by a subsidiary of the Group (ASDA Stores Limited) in respect of fuel delivered directly by third-party suppliers to Euro Garages Limited sites has been eliminated on consolidation within the Group financial statements. _Interest and dividend income_ Interest income is recognised in the Income Statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the Company's profit on the date the Company’s right to receive payments is established. _Income from concessions and commissions_ Income from concessions and commissions is based on the terms of the contract and is included within other income (see note 4 for further detail). Unbilled amounts of income to which the Group is contractually entitled are included in trade and other receivables. Billed amounts unpaid at the year-end are included in trade receivables or offset against corresponding trade payables where a contractual right of offset exists. Supplier income recognised in the Income Statement and accounted for within trade receivables at the year-end for which estimation and judgement is required is £0.9m (2022: £1.2m). This represents the net amount of accrued income of £0.9m (2022: £1.2m) and deferred income of £nil (2022: £nil) on deals running across the year-end. The Group is currently working to identify the physical risk to our business and supply chains from the changing climate, along with the potential impact of policy, technology and market changes as we transition to a lower carbon future. This is a developing area with inherent uncertainty which is constantly evolving. The work being undertaken will be embedded in our risk management framework to help inform our overall response to the risks and opportunities that are identified. Our assessment to date has not identified material expenditure arising out of the impact of climate-related risk and this is reflected in the financial forecasts used to assess the going concern basis and to determine the recoverable amount of long-lived assets. Management will continue to monitor this in future periods. The Group is subject to a maintenance covenant whereby the senior secured net leverage ratio cannot exceed 4.90:1. This covenant is required to be tested if, as at the quarter end, drawings on the RCF exceed 40% of the facility. The Directors have also considered whether the above scenarios trigger the requirement to test the Group’s financial covenant and have confirmed that there would be no requirement to test financial covenants under the cashflow scenarios modelled during the going concern period. The model has been reverse stress tested to determine the level of sales and margin decline that would lead to the Group breaching the level of available facilities or covenants. The Directors consider that the likelihood of such a significant deterioration of cash flows or profitability is remote. Furthermore, the Directors have considered the potential impact of strategic options which would further accelerate the Group’s ability to achieve its growth ambitions. These include, but are not limited to, investments to enable organic growth as well as significant potential acquisition opportunities, some of which may require additional capital and funding required to execute these opportunities. Whilst no options have reached the commitment stage, the impact of the most advanced of these options, including incremental capital and funding requirements, has been modelled based on the Directors’ best estimate of the assumptions required for the initial investment, terms of financing and post-acquisition trading. In addition to undertaking normal diligence processes before committing to such a strategic option, and in accordance with the Group’s established governance framework as outlined on pages 23-30 of the Strategic Report, the Boards of the controlling parent (Bellis Topco 2 Limited) and of the Company have approved a resolution that sets out the required financial and associated criteria that must apply for the most advanced strategic option to be executed in the going concern review period. Such criteria include, inter alia, not progressing until appropriate financing is in place within specified cost parameters which ensure both affordability and the ability of the Group to continue to meet its liabilities and covenant requirements in the going concern period. For the most advanced strategic option, the Group has modelled a potential severe but plausible downside scenario of the combined Group, which includes, where relevant, sensitivities of the post-acquisition trading and any assumed synergies. In such scenarios, the Group maintains sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom in the going concern period, having applied mitigations under the control of management where necessary. Whilst the most advanced strategic option (and any related finance) are not committed to, as of the date of approval of the financial statements, the Directors consider that the governance processes outlined in this note will ensure that if the modelled strategic option were committed to, that this would not impact the ability of the Group to meet its liabilities for the going concern period to 30 June 2024. Thus, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis without any material uncertainties. _Business combinations - acquisition date relating to the Group's acquisition of ASDA Group Limited (prior period)_ On 16 February 2021, Mohsin and Zuber Issa, founders and co-CEOs of EG Group, a global convenience and forecourts retailer, headquartered in Blackburn, UK, and investment funds managed by TDR Capital LLP (“TDR Capital”), a leading UK-based private equity firm, together acquired ASDA Group Limited (“ASDA”). Under the new ownership structure, Mohsin and Zuber Issa and TDR Capital indirectly own 100% of the ordinary shares in Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited (“BAC3”) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which in turn acquired the entire issued share capital of ASDA. On 10 February 2021, the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order (IEO) under section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Zuber Issa, Mohsin Issa, TDR Capital LLP and ASDA in relation to the acquisition by BAC3 of ASDA. The IEO commenced on 16 February 2021, the day transaction legally completed and was lifted on 16 June 2021. In determining the acquisition date, for the purposes of applying IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the Directors considered whether the IEO restrictions prevented BAC3 from controlling ASDA. In making this judgement the Directors considered BAC3’s ability to direct the relevant activities of ASDA that could impact its return during the IEO period. The Directors concluded that control transferred on 16 February 2021, as there was sufficient evidence of BAC3’s ability to direct ASDA from this date. The IEO was subsequently lifted on 16 June 2021. As a result, ASDA Group Limited and its subsidiaries have been consolidated in these financial statements since 16 February 2021. _IFRS 16 lease term_ IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the period covered by options to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option, and the period covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise the option. The Group applies judgement to whether an extension should be added to the non-cancellable lease term with reference to the following: - Extension options in the contract. Consideration as to whether any option is reasonably certain to be exercised is based on whether an economic incentive exists to do so. This incentive is assessed by reference to multiple factors including but not limited to current operational performance of the site and future performance projections, length of time to the option exercise date and future capital requirements. The majority of the Group's leases do not have extension options in the contract but, where they do, most lease terms include the extension period. - Geographical factors. A term extension on any lease for sites in England and Wales may be judged reasonably certain on the basis of security of tenure if an economic incentive to remain in the lease beyond the contractual term is deemed to exist. This incentive is assessed by reference to the same factors listed above. If an extension is judged reasonably certain, the typical additional term applied is 10 years. Geographical factors are not considered for sites outside England and Wales. In the event of changing circumstances or new information that may impact judgements taken, lease terms will be re-assessed on a lease by lease basis. Term reassessments are identified on an ad-hoc basis in light of new or updated information which would impact the assumptions originally recognised. Any change in lease term could result in a recalculation of the lease liability and a material adjustment to the associated right-of-use asset. There are no examples of term reassessment in 2022. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) _IFRS 16 discount rate_ IFRS 16 requires that lease liabilities are discounted at the interest rate implicit in a lease, or where this isn’t available, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate. The majority of the Group’s leases do not include an interest rate implicit in the lease, and therefore the incremental borrowing rate is utilised to discount these leases. The incremental borrowing rate is considered a key judgement and under IFRS 16 reflects the rate of interest a lessee would incur to borrow over a similar term, with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value in a similar economic environment. We consider the following factors in determining the incremental borrowing rate: - The risk free rate of return in the UK market; and, - The credit risk spread which reflects the additional risks associated with lending specifically to the Group, taking account of factors such as our credit rating, the term of the lease, and the geographic location. The risk free rate is observable in the market and is the base of our calculation, however there is significant judgement in determining the additional credit risk spread specific to the Group on the basis that there is limited market observable data on which to make this judgement, particularly for lease terms in excess of 10 years. As a result we utilise rates from other geographical regions (e.g. US) for companies with a similar credit rating where there is more market observable data on which to base our judgement. The geographical locations utilised, alongside the specific data selected for inclusion are considered a key judgement. Due to the extent of the Group’s lease portfolio, small changes in discount rate can significantly impact the accounting recognition and could result in a material difference to the right-of-use asset, lease liability, and associated depreciation and interest charge recognised in the Income Statement. Further, the Group has leases for a wide range of different terms, from 1 year to in excess of 100 years. Judgement is used by the Group to apply a cap of 30 years to the discount rate on the basis that data relating to loans for terms in excess of 30 years is rare and as such, no more reliable rate than a 30 year rate can be determined. The Group also applies judgement in determining the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis. Management have asserted that by updating the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis, we ensure that the discount rate used remains relevant, current and materially correct. Should events and conditions change in the interim period we would consider whether the discount rate should be updated on a more frequent basis. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) _Supply Chain Finance_ Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be classified as trade payables or as another line item on the Balance Sheet. In determining the classification, the Group reviews each arrangement against a number of characteristics to assess whether the substance of liabilities owed by the Group to the participating banks under the contractual terms of the arrangements is consistent with other trade payables. These include: - Whether participation in the schemes is voluntary for suppliers; - Whether the Group is involved in the negotiations and agreements between the banks and suppliers or tri-partite agreements exist; - Whether payment terms have been extended outside industry norms for trade payables; - Whether interest is accrued on outstanding balances or fees are receivable by the Group; - Whether the banks require parent guarantees in respect of the Group’s obligations; - Whether the Group retains its rights to offset credits or withhold payment. The nature of the Group’s liabilities under supply chain financing arrangements when considering these characteristics supports classification of amounts owed by the Group under its supply chain financing arrangements as trade payables. _Litigation_ Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance with IAS 37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters are made in relation to contingent liabilities (note 27). _Estimates Deferred gain relating to sale-and-leaseback transaction_ The Group estimates the gain on sale to be recognised in the Income Statement based on the amount of the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The remaining gain is deferred as a reduction to the right-of-use asset relating to the leaseback. This estimate requires determining the fair value of the properties transferred and calculating the lease liability of the leaseback. As noted in the ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’ section above, there is inherent judgement included in the determination of the appropriate discount rate. The fair value of properties transferred is determined using third party valuation specialists. Please see further detail on financial amounts in the prior period in note 9. _Discount rate_ When discounting payments to present value, the Group uses the interest rate implicit in the lease if this rate can be readily determined. For a small volume of high value leases, the rate implicit in the lease can be calculated and has therefore been used. Otherwise, for the majority of leases the rate used is based on an estimated incremental borrowing rate. Further detail on the calculation of the incremental borrowing rate is detailed in the ‘Key judgements’ section of this note under the heading ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’. _Right-of-use Assets_ Right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day (including lease buy out payments made to previous tenants) less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term. If the lease includes an option to transfer ownership of the underlying asset, or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. Depreciation is charged from the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the ‘Impairment of non-financial assets' policy above. _Non-lease components and variable rent expense_ As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has taken this election with the exception of IT and printer leases where other charges included in the contract (maintenance and replenishment) are accounted for separately within related cost lines. The primary non-lease components recognised within lease payments are property costs (service charges and insurances) paid to landlords and included within the terms of lease contracts. These costs are included within the lease payments at commencement date if fixed, or within variable rent expense as incurred if not. The majority of these payments are variable and therefore not included in the lease liability. As a lessee, the Group does not have any rent payment terms linked to sales or other variable metrics. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception.

The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments (refer to note 19 for further details). In addition, the Group uses cross-currency-interest-rate swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk and floating interest rate risk relating to its foreign currency borrowings. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. For hedges of foreign currency purchases the gain or loss is recognised within cost of inventories. For cross-currency-interest-rate-swaps, the gain or loss is recognised in finance costs or finance income. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated Income Statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the Consolidated Income Statement. _Non-interest-bearing financial liabilities_ The Group’s non-interest-bearing financial liabilities include trade and other payables and intercompany payables, which are recognised at amortised cost. _Interest-bearing borrowings_ The Group’ interest-bearing borrowings include intercompany borrowings and external borrowings and are recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.

Gains or losses arising on repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income or finance costs. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities except for those with contractual maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date. _Offsetting of financial instruments_ Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. _Fair values_ Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) Unbilled amounts of income to which the Group is contractually entitled are included in trade and other receivables, or offset against corresponding trade payables, however these amounts are not material. Billed amounts unpaid at the year-end are included in trade receivables or offset against corresponding trade payables where a contractual right of offset exists. Supplier income recognised in the Income Statement and accounted for within trade receivables (note 16) at the year-end for which estimation and judgement is required is £1.2m (2021: £0.8m). This represents the net amount of accrued income of £1.2m (2021: £0.8m) and deferred income of £nil (2021: £nil) on deals running across the year-end. _IFRS 16 discount rate_ IFRS 16 requires that lease liabilities are discounted at the interest rate implicit in a lease, or where this isn’t available, the Group’s incremental borrowing rate.

The incremental borrowing rate is considered a key judgement and under IFRS 16 reflects the rate of interest a lessee would have to borrow over a similar term, with similar security, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value in a similar economic environment. We consider the following factors in determining the incremental borrowing rate: - The risk free rate of return in the UK market; and, - The credit risk spread which reflects the additional risks associated with lending specifically to the Group, taking account of factors such as our credit rating, the term of the lease, and the geographic location. The risk free rate is observable in the market and is the base of our calculation, however there is significant judgement in determining the additional credit risk spread specific to the Group on the basis that there is limited market observable data on which to make this judgement, particularly for lease terms in excess of 10 years. As a result we utilise rates from other geographical regions (e.g. US) for companies with a similar credit rating where there is more market observable data on which to base our judgement. The geographical locations utilised, alongside the specific data selected for inclusion are considered a key judgement. Due to the extent of the Group’s lease portfolio, small changes in discount rate can significantly impact the accounting recognition and could result in a material difference to the right-of-use asset, lease liability, and associated depreciation and interest charge recognised in the Income Statement. Further, the Group has leases for a wide range of different terms, from 1 year to in excess of 100 years. Judgement is used by the Group to apply a cap of 30 years to the discount rate on the basis that data relating to loans for terms in excess of 30 years is rare and as such, no more reliable rate than a 30 year rate can be determined. The Group also applies judgement in determining the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis. Management have asserted that by updating the incremental borrowing rate on a quarterly basis, we ensure that the discount rate used remains relevant, current and materially correct. Should events and conditions change in the interim period we would consider whether the discount rate should be updated on a more frequent basis. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued) _Supply Chain Finance_ Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be classified as trade payables or as another line item on the Balance Sheet. In determining the classification, the Group reviews each arrangement against a number of characteristics to assess whether the substance of liabilities owed by the Group to the participating banks under the contractual terms of the arrangements is consistent with other trade payables. These include: - Whether participation in the schemes is voluntary for suppliers; - Whether the Group is involved in the negotiations and agreements between the banks and suppliers or tri-partite agreements exist; - Whether payment terms have been extended outside industry norms for trade payables; - Whether interest is accrued on outstanding balances or fees are receivable by the Group; - Whether the banks require parent guarantees in respect of the Group’s obligations; - Whether the Group retains its rights to offset credits or withhold payment. The nature of the Group’s liabilities under supply chain financing arrangements when considering these characteristics supports classification of amounts owed by the Group under its supply chain financing arrangements as trade payables. _Pension buy-in_ Prior to the buy-out of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme (“the AGPS” or “the Scheme”) during the period, the Group retained an obligation to fund pension liabilities of the Scheme in the event of insurer default. As such, the buy-in did not meet the criteria of a settlement event as set out in IAS 19 - Employee Benefits and therefore, prior to the buy-out on 9 July 2021, actuarial gains and losses associated with the buy-in which arose prior to the buy-out have been recognised in other comprehensive income during the period. Further detail is provided in note 20. _Pension buy-out_ On 9 July 2021, the trustees of the AGPS completed a buy-out of the Scheme whereby an insurer, Rothesay Life, have become fully and directly responsible for the pension obligations of the Scheme. In the Directors’ opinion, this meets the definition of a settlement event per requirements of IAS 19 as the completion of the buy-out represents absolute extinguishment of the Scheme’s risk of exposure to pension liabilities and therefore also represents absolute extinguishment of the Group’s obligations as sponsoring employer to fund the liabilities of the AGPS. As such, other than £0.5m of assets and liabilities which were outside the scope of the buy-out, the Group has de-recognised all AGPS assets and liabilities during the period. Further details of the resultant impact of the buy-out on other comprehensive income and operating expenses are provided in note 20. _Litigation_ Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance with IAS 37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters are made in contingent liabilities (note 26). ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued) _Business combinations - acquisition date_ On 16 February 2021, Mohsin and Zuber Issa, founders and co-CEOs of EG Group, a global convenience and forecourts retailer, headquartered in Blackburn, UK, and investment funds managed by TDR Capital LLP (“TDR Capital”), a leading UK-based private equity firm, together acquired ASDA Group Limited (“ASDA”). Under the new ownership structure, Mohsin and Zuber Issa and TDR Capital indirectly own 100% of the ordinary shares in Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited (“BAC3”) a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, which in turn acquired the entire issued share capital of ASDA. On 10 February 2021, the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order (IEO) under section 72(2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Zuber Issa, Mohsin Issa, TDR Capital LLP and ASDA in relation to the acquisition by BAC3 of ASDA. The IEO commenced on 16 February 2021, the day transaction legally completed and was lifted on 16 June 2021. In determining the acquisition date, for the purposes of applying IFRS 3 Business Combinations, the Directors have considered whether the IEO restrictions prevented BAC3 from controlling ASDA. In making this judgement the Directors considered BAC3’s ability to direct the relevant activities of ASDA that could impact its return during the IEO period. The Directors concluded that control transferred on 16 February 2021, as there was sufficient evidence of BAC3’s ability to direct ASDA from this date. The IEO was subsequently lifted on 16 June 2021. As a result, ASDA Group Limited and its subsidiaries are consolidated in these financial statements from 16 February 2021. _Estimates Insurance_ The insurance provision (note 21) relates to liabilities arising from past events which are not covered by third party insurance. This includes both known and potential claims from stores and depots. Estimates are made with regards to determining the provision required either by actuarial assessment or based on historical experience. _Deferred gain relating to sale-and-leaseback transaction_ The Group estimates the gain on sale to be recognised in the Income Statement based on the amount of the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The remaining gain is deferred as a reduction to the right-of-use asset relating to the leaseback. This estimate requires determining the fair value of the properties transferred and calculating the lease liability of the leaseback. As noted in the ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’ section above, there is inherent judgement included in the determination of the appropriate discount rate. The fair value of properties transferred is determined using third party valuation specialists. Please see further detail on financial amounts in note 9. _Discount rate_ When discounting payments to present value, the Group uses the interest rate implicit in the lease if this rate can be readily determined. For a small volume of high value leases, the rate implicit in the lease can be calculated and has therefore been used. Otherwise, for the majority of leases the rate used is based on an estimated incremental borrowing rate. Further detail on the calculation of the incremental borrowing rate is detailed in the ‘Key judgements’ section of this note under the heading ‘IFRS 16 discount rate’. _Right-of-use Assets_ Right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day (including lease buy out payments made to previous tenants) less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term. If the lease includes an option to transfer ownership of the underlying asset, or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-of-use asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. Depreciation is charged from the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the ‘Impairment of non-financial assets' policy above. _Non-lease components and variable rent expense_ As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has taken this election with the exception of IT and printer leases where other charges included in the contract (maintenance and replenishment) are accounted for separately within related cost lines. The primary non-lease components recognised within lease payments are property costs (service charges and insurances) paid to landlords and included within the terms of lease contracts. These costs are included within the lease payments at commencement date if fixed, or within variable rent expense as incurred if not. The majority of these payments are variable and therefore not included in the lease liability. As a lessee, the Group does not have any rent payment terms linked to sales or other variable metrics. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued) For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. All of the Group’s hedges are considered to be cash flow hedges, hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. The Group uses forward currency contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments (refer to note 18 for further details). In addition, the Group uses cross-currency-interest-rate swaps to hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk and floating interest rate risk relating to its foreign currency borrowings. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement. For hedges of foreign currency purchases the gain or loss is recognised within cost of inventories. For Cross-currency-interest-rate-swaps, the gain or loss is recognised in finance costs or finance income. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the consolidated Income Statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the Income Statement. _Non-interest-bearing financial liabilities_ The Group’s non-interest-bearing financial liabilities, include trade and other payables, and intercompany payables, which are recognised at amortised cost. _Interest-bearing borrowings_ The Group’ interest-bearing borrowings include intercompany borrowings and external borrowings and are recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or losses arising on repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income or finance cost. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities except for those with contractual maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date. _Offsetting of financial instruments_ Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. _Fair values_ Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The acquisition will support and accelerate ASDA’s existing strategy to expand in the convenience market. On 26 October 2022 the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order (“IEO”) under section 72 (2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Asda Stores Limited; Asda Group Limited; Mr Mohsin Issa; Mr Zuber Issa; TDR Capital LLP; TDR Capital III Portfolio No. 2 L.P.; TDR Capital III Investments (2019) L.P.; Co-operative Group Limited and Arthur Foodstores Limited. The IEO commenced on 30 October 2022. The Directors have considered the criteria set out in IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated Financial Statements’ required to establish control over a subsidiary which are as follows and all of which need to be met to consolidate an investee as a subsidiary in the consolidated financial statements: (a) power over the investee, for example through voting or other rights; (b) exposure to, or rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and (c) the ability to use its power over the investee to affect the amount of the Group's returns. The IEO placed restrictions on the Group which included to hold separate the Arthur business. This restricted the Group’s ability to direct relevant activities including, for example, preventing the Group from managing employees of Arthur, setting retail prices for the grocery and fuel business, and placing other restrictions such as performing any integration activities, or exchanging of commercially sensitive information. To comply with the IEO restrictions, an independent management team was appointed to run the Arthur business and an Outsourcing and Interim Franchising Agreement (“OIFA”) with the previous owner was executed. Further, the Group sought certain derogations during the period to ensure that the Arthur business runs on a going concern basis as per the IEO. The Group held 100% of share capital and was exposed to the variable returns during the IEO period, however, did not have power over Arthur Foodstores whilst the IEO remained in place. As at 31 December 2022, as a result of restrictions as explained above, the Group concluded that it did not have control of Arthur Foodstores Limited at that date (from October 30 to December 31, 2022) and therefore the results of the business were not consolidated in the prior year consolidated financial statements. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

If the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and any amount recognised for the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the difference represents a gain on bargain purchase (negative goodwill) and is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as other income. The fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in a business combination are measured at acquisition date fair value in accordance with IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ with the exception of income taxes, employee benefits, reimbursement assets, reacquired rights, share-based payments and assets held-for-sale. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit, or group of units, to which goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation. Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Software costs capitalised consist of both costs from third parties and costs of internal resources involved in development activities. When considering whether software costs can be capitalised, the Directors perform an assessment of whether the Group controls the underlying asset. Factors considered when assessing whether the Group controls an asset include where and how the software is hosted and the ability the Group has to make changes to the software. Costs are only capitalised once a project is in the development stage and approval for the project as a whole to be completed has been obtained. Costs incurred in the research stage are expensed as incurred. Integration costs between different software are capitalised where it can be demonstrated that these are separate intangible assets and control is evident. In relation to Software as a Service (“SAAS”) contracts, where it cannot be demonstrated that the Group controls the underlying assets' development, costs incurred are immediately recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement other than software licence fees which are included in prepaid expenses and amortised over the period of the respective licence. The factors noted above in relation to how the software is hosted and whether the Group has the ability to make or direct changes directly to the underlying software as part of the SAAS contract are considered as part of this assessment. Where implementation costs are incurred as part of a SAAS contract, these implementation costs are separately considered to identify whether they represent an intangible asset in their own right as detailed above. If the Directors conclude that implementation costs do not meet the recognition criteria of a separate intangible asset, an assessment is then made as to whether the costs represent configuration of the software product or customisation. If configuration, these costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred, whereas if customisation the Directors will assess whether these should be recognised over the term of the SAAS contract if they are not distinct from the underlying software product itself. Purchases of hardware are capitalised as Property, Plant and Equipment.

Where an asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs. If any such indication exists, the asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount is estimated. Indefinite lived intangibles (such as Goodwill) are tested annually for impairment regardless of whether any indicators for impairment exist. An asset’s or CGU’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time-value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less). For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed. _Lease liability_ The lease liability is initially measured at the value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted to present value. Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise: - Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable; - Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the commencement date; - The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees; - The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and, - Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease. Lease liabilities are presented as separate current and non-current amounts in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made. The Group re-measures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever: - The lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is re-measured by discounting the revised lease payments using the current discount rate; - The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using an unchanged discount rate; or, - A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is re-measured based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification. _Discount rate_ When discounting payments to present value, the Group uses the interest rate implicit in the lease if this rate can be readily determined. For a small volume of high value leases, the rate implicit in the lease can be calculated and has therefore been used. Otherwise, for the majority of leases the rate used is based on an estimated incremental borrowing rate.

The Group re-measures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever: - The lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is re-measured by discounting the revised lease payments using the current discount rate; - The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using an unchanged discount rate; or, - A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is re-measured based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Revenue is recognised at the point at which the Group has satisfied its performance obligations under a contract with the customer and control of the goods has passed to the customer. For non-fuel and fuel revenue generated through customer sales in retail outlets and online, proceeds are recovered from the customer either immediately through the receipt of cash at the point of sale or on settlement of card transactions which occurs one working day after the point of sale in the vast majority of cases. For store sales, revenue is recognised at the point of sale as that is the point at which the Directors determine that control of the goods has passed to the customer. For online sales, revenue is recognised at the point of despatch of goods to the customer (for goods delivered directly from the Group’s fulfilment centres to customers) or collection of goods by the customer (where customers utilise Click & Collect) as this is the point at which the Directors determine that control of the goods has passed to the customer. _Wholesale revenue - Grocery_ The Group engages in wholesale of grocery items to third party wholesale partners who subsequently sell these goods to third party customers in their own retail outlets. As part of these arrangements, the Group receives goods from third party suppliers into its distribution network and assumes responsibility for delivery of goods to the retail outlets of the wholesale partners. The Group also assumes inventory risk for the period from supplier deliveries of goods into the Group’s distribution network to the point at which delivery of goods to wholesale partners’ retail sites is completed. Wholesale revenue is recognised when goods are delivered to the wholesale customers’ retail outlets as this is the point at which the Group has satisfied its performance obligations under its contracts with the wholesale partners.

Under the MIP, an intermediate holding company of the Group - Bellis Midco 2 Limited - has entered into an agreement with the holders of MIP management shares (“MIP scheme members”) whereby MIP scheme members are granted a put option which, when exercised, enables them to sell their management shares to Bellis Midco 2 Limited or another non-Group entity for a value determined by an independent valuation determined at the exercise date. MIP scheme members are required to be employed by the Group at the grant date of the MIP shares. If a member of the scheme ceases to be employed by the Group during the vesting period, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, a parent of Bellis Finco PLC, has the option to repurchase, or nominate another entity of the Group to repurchase, the shares during the 12 month period after the member’s leave date. As such, the Directors have determined that the MIP scheme falls within the scope of IFRS 2. The difference between the IFRS 2 fair value and the fair value paid by MIP scheme members at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period (i.e. the period from date on which the MIP shares are granted to the estimated exercise date) as an expense in the consolidated Income Statement. As neither MIP shares nor put options over MIP shares are issued by entities within the Group, and as there is no recharge agreement in place which requires any entity within the Group to settle liabilities in respect of MIP shares, changes in the fair value of MIP shares are accounted for on an equity-settled basis. For all liabilities arising from share-based payment arrangements the Group has applied IFRS 2 ‘Share-Based Payments’. _Share options granted prior to the acquisition of ASDA Group Limited_ All share-based payment liabilities issued prior to the acquisition of ASDA Group Limited were settled during the prior period. The share option programmes allowed Group employees to acquire shares of the former ultimate parent company of ASDA Group Limited - Walmart Inc. These awards were granted by a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group. The fair value of options granted was initially measured at grant date and spread over the period during which the employees became unconditionally entitled to payment. The charge was recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value of the share options was measured based on an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The liability was re-measured at each Balance Sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value were recognised in the consolidated Income Statement during the vesting period. These share-based payment transactions were accounted for as cash-settled. _Management Incentive Plan_ During the year, management shares in the immediate parent company of the Group were issued to eligible members of senior management employed by the Group as part of a Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) in exchange for proceeds determined by an independent calculation of fair value at the issue date. Under the MIP, an intermediate holding company of the Group - Bellis Midco 2 Limited - has entered into an agreement with the holders of MIP management shares (“MIP scheme members”) whereby MIP scheme members are granted a put option which, when exercised, enables them to sell their management shares to Bellis Midco 2 Limited or another non-Group entity for a value determined by an independent valuation determined at the exercise date. MIP scheme members are required to be employed by the Group at the grant date of the MIP shares. If a member of the scheme ceases to be employed by the Group during the vesting period, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, a parent of Bellis Finco PLC, has the option to repurchase, or nominate another entity of the Group to repurchase, the shares during the 12 month period after the member’s leave date. As such, the Directors have determined that the MIP scheme falls within the scope of IFRS 2.

The acquisition will support and accelerate ASDA’s existing strategy to expand in the convenience market. An Initial Enforcement Order (IEO) was served by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) on 30 October 2022, which restricted the Group’s ability to run or make changes to Arthur Foodstores. On 14 March 2023, the CMA issued its findings which stated that the acquisition may result in a substantial lessening of competition in certain areas. On 28 March 2023, undertakings were offered to the CMA which involved divesting of 13 petrol filling stations. On 30 May 2023 these undertakings were accepted by the CMA, and the IEO was lifted other than for the 13 petrol filling stations. Control is deemed to have transferred to ASDA Stores on 30 May 2023 and Arthur Foodstores has been consolidated from this date. See note 1 for further detail. The consideration transferred was £457.4m. This comprises cash consideration of £228.6m which was settled by ASDA Stores on 28 October 2022, further consideration funded by issue of a bridge loan for net proceeds of £195.0m (£200.0m loan less £5.0m bank fees) which was drawn down on 28 October 2022, further cash consideration of £4.4m which was settled by ASDA Stores on 24 May 2023 and payables novated from the seller of £29.4m. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) _Prior period_ On 16 February 2021, Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco PLC, acquired 100% of the entire issued share capital of ASDA Group Limited (ASDA) from ASDA Holdings UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Walmart Inc.

This comprised cash consideration of £6,568.3m payable on or after 16 February 2021 and £157.5m which was settled by ASDA on behalf of Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited prior to 16 February 2021. Included within the £6,568.3m is £6,518.0m which was settled during the prior period, £38.8m, which has been settled during the current year, and £11.5m which is outstanding at the balance sheet date and is included in trade and other payables. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) On 16 February 2021, Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco PLC, acquired 100% of the entire issued share capital of ASDA Group Limited (ASDA) from ASDA Holdings UK Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Walmart Inc.

These acquisition-related costs include stamp duty and advisory fees in respect of legal, accounting, property valuation and other professional matters. For the year ended 31 December 2023, Arthur Foodstores Limited contributed revenue of £587.8m and loss before tax of £5.9m to the Group’s results. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023, management estimates that consolidated revenue for the year ended 31 December 2023 would have been £26,012.7m, and the consolidated profit before tax for the twelve-month period would have been £191.2m. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, that arose on the date of acquisition would have been materially the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) _Business combinations - acquisition date relating to the Group's purchase of the share capital of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited_ On 31 October 2023, Project America Bidco Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco PLC, acquired 100% of the entire issued share capital of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited from EG Finco Limited, a related party of the Group for consideration of £2.025bn on a debt-free basis. The acquisition will support and accelerate ASDA's existing strategy to expand in the convenience market. Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited and its subsidiaries are consolidated within the Group from this date. The cash consideration transferred as of 31 December 2023 of £2,000.1m and professional and bank fees transferred of £109m were funded through a combination of a £401m subordinated shareholder loan, a £684m private placement, £646m of proceeds from a sale and leaseback transaction, a £290m bridge loan and £88m of cash on balance sheet. The bridge loan was refinanced via a further ground rent property transaction which completed on 12 December 2023 for proceeds of £400m. After repaying the bridge loan, the remaining proceeds from the ground rent transaction were retained on the balance sheet and in part used to settle transaction fees. Estimated deferred consideration of £25.3m has been included in trade and other payables at 31 December 2023. Settlement of deferred consideration is expected to be funded by cash on balance sheet. At completion, the Group entered into a number of arrangements with EG Finco Limited, including a Transitional Services Agreement (TSA), an integration support arrangement and lease agreements for properties owned or leased by the Group from which subsidiaries of EG Finco Limited continue to operate franchise foodservice and electric vehicle charging businesses post-acquisition. These arrangements were all negotiated concurrently with the acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited, are interdependent with the terms of the acquisition, and were negotiated as a single transaction. The Directors have assessed that purchase price agreed with the seller of £2.07bn and the terms of the transaction as being on an arm’s length basis. The purchase price of £2.07bn is prior to adjustments for working capital and net debt as outlined in the sale and purchase agreement. Under the TSA, a subsidiary of EG Finco Limited will provide Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited and its subsidiaries with IT and other centralised services for an initial term of two years. During this initial term, these services are provided at £nil cost to the Group, subject to certain limited exceptions. In addition, EG Finco Limited has also agreed for a period of two years to reimburse the Group for certain centralised costs which transferred as part of the transaction perimeter and are required to support the acquired business. This arrangement is not considered to be part of the business combination and therefore, £27.3m of the consideration transferred has been allocated to the TSA arrangement based on the fair value of the services provided subsidiaries of EG Finco Limited and the estimated costs to be recharged by the Group to EG Finco Limited. This has been recognised within prepayments and will be recognised within operating expenses in the Consolidated Income Statement over the initial two-year term of the TSA. The carrying value of the prepayment at 31 December 2023 is £25.0m. Under the integration support arrangement, the Group and EG Finco Limited entered into an agreement whereby EG Finco Limited would support the costs associated with the integration of the acquisition by the Group for a fixed amount of £11.3m over two years with the payments made quarterly. The full amount has been recorded as an adjustment to the purchase consideration and recognised within Other Debtors. The carrying amount of the receivable at 31 December 2023 is £11.3m. The Group has entered into a number of lease arrangements with subsidiaries of EG Finco Limited at completion relating to properties owned or leased by the Group. A number of these lease arrangements have been classified as finance leases and a finance lease receivable has been recognised on acquisition with respect to these leases. The carrying value of the finance lease receivable at 31 December 2023 is disclosed in note 13. For leases which are classified as operating leases, the rentals recognised through the income statement in the year and the amounts outstanding at 31 December 2023 are disclosed in note 30. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) The fair value of acquired receivables is materially equal to the contractual amounts receivable. The fair value adjustments to the assets and liabilities assumed are final. The total consideration remains provisional at the balance date and is management’s best estimate at this time. Consideration will be finalised once completion accounts are agreed with the seller. Any adjustments to consideration arising out the agreement of the completion accounts will be taken to goodwill. Costs directly relating to completion of the business combination of £53.2m have been included in operating costs in the Consolidated Income Statement in the current year. For the year-ended 31 December 2023, Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited contributed revenue of £410.9m and profit before tax of £17.7m to the Group’s results. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023, management estimates that consolidated revenue for the year-ended 31 December 2023 would have been £27,551.0m and the consolidated profit before tax would have been £251.4m. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments which arose on the date of acquisition would have been materially the same if the acquisition had occurred on 1 January 2023. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) The fair value of the net assets acquired on 16 February 2021 and the resulting gain on bargain purchase recognised during the prior period is set out in the table below. The fair value of acquired receivables was materially equal to the contractual amounts receivable. The acquisition resulted in a gain on bargain purchase being recognised as Other Income in the consolidated income statement of £2,654.3m for the period ending 31 December 2021. The gain on bargain purchase arises as a result of the valuation basis applied to individual assets in accordance with IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement differing from the basis on which the purchase price was determined - notably the property valuations included in the net assets acquired being determined on a rental yield basis compared to the purchase price being determined based on a multiple of EBITDA. In addition, further details on internally generated intangibles, including the ASDA and George brand licences and customer relationships, that have been capitalised are included in note 13. Costs directly relating to completion of the business combinations in the prior period of £92.6m have been included in prior period operating costs in the consolidated Income Statement. These acquisition-related costs included stamp duty and advisory fees in respect of legal, accounting, property valuation and other professional matters. No further amounts have been incurred during the year in respect of this acquisition. For the period ended 31 December 2021, ASDA contributed revenue of £20,710.4m and profit before tax of £963.9m to the Group’s results. If the acquisition had occurred on 3 September 2020, management estimates that consolidated revenue would have been £31,378.7m, and consolidated profit before tax for the period would have been £3,145.1m. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments, that arose on the date of acquisition would have been materially the same if the acquisition had occurred on 3 September 2020. Reimbursement income As a condition of the sale of ASDA to the Group, the Group was indemnified by ASDA Holdings UK Limited (""AHUKL"") - a third party to the Group - in respect of tax expenses and any associated interest which may arise as a result of events that occurred prior to 16 February 2021. During the year, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the Group recognised tax expenses relating to corporation tax reliefs claimed by those entities in the years ending 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2017 (see note 10 for further detail). A fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent undertaking of AHUKL has settled tax and interest relating to this matter on the Group's behalf and this amount of £49.3m is included in other income. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) The fair value of the net assets acquired on 16 February 2021 and the resulting gain on bargain purchase is set out in the table below.

(ii) Since the acquisition of ASDA Group Limited in the period ended 31 December 2021, the Group has embarked on a programme, Project Future, to separate its IT systems from its previous owner Walmart. A Transitional Services Agreement (""TSA"") is in place with Walmart. The separation programme will transition the Group to a standalone, leading edge IT infrastructure which will enable it to improve operating efficiencies, make better use of data, improve experience for customers and colleagues, and enable the business to be more agile in responding to customers’ needs. Amounts classified as non-underlying during the current year and prior year relate to costs incurred outside the normal course of business in respect of research spend, design and build costs relating to IT infrastructure and SAAS solutions which cannot be capitalised (see note 1 for further detail), consultancy costs incurred in relation to the management of the programme, run costs relating to standalone systems where equivalent legacy Walmart systems are still in use by the business, and costs of interim software solutions which do not meet the criteria of the Group's policy to capitalise (see note 1 for further detail). Where legacy Walmart systems are still in use, the costs of these are included in charges relating to the TSA. The total IT spend included in underlying operating costs reflects management’s expectation of the level of annual spend required to operate the business on standalone IT systems in the normal course of business which includes the charges incurred under the TSA and a proportion of Project Future costs. (iii) Reimbursed settlement relating to historic tax reliefs: As detailed in note 11, the Group's tax and interest liabilities to the tax authorities arising out of settlement of this matter were settled in full in the prior year by a fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent of ASDA Holdings UK Limited (""AHUKL"" - the former immediate parent of ASDA Group Limited). This satisfied AHUKL's obligations to the Group arising out of this matter as set out in the sale and purchase agreement relating to the Group's acquisition of ASDA and as such, there were no cashflow impacts on the Group during the prior year or current year. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) Impacts of the above items on the consolidated pre-tax cash flows of the Group are as follows:",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Further sale-and-leasebacks for three properties were completed on 30 August 2023, 13 September 2023 and 15 November 2023 respectively. The properties were sold at fair value to a third party. In accordance with IFRS 15, it was determined that the transfer of the properties to an independent third party for proceeds of £645.6m is considered a sale. In the period ended 31 December 2023, assets relating to the properties with a Net Book Value of £625.7m were sold and the Group has recognised a gain on sale of £3.3m representing the amount of the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor. The remaining gain of £16.6m is deferred as a reduction to the right-of-use assets relating to the leaseback. Similarly, the cash proceeds arising from the sale-and-leaseback transaction have been separately classified as investing (£136.2m) to reflect the relative proportion of the proceeds relating to the transfer of rights to the buyer-lessor with the remaining proceeds classified as financing (£509.4m). These properties were leased back to the Group on terms of 35 years (including the assumption that leases will be extended by 10 years). The Group continues to lease these properties from entities controlled by the Buyer and has adjusted the right of use assets and lease liabilities to reflect amended terms of the leases on transfer to the third-party entities at that date. The leasebacks of the properties, taking into account the deferral of a proportion of the disposal gain into the right-of-use asset and subsequent modification to the lease term, resulted in an increase in right-of-use assets of £492.8m and lease liabilities of £509.4m. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

In addition, following amendments to IAS12, deferred tax liabilities in relation to right of use assets and deferred tax assets in relation to lease liabilities have been separately disclosed. The deferred tax asset in relation to dilapidation provisions of £9.1m (2022: £7.1m) has been reclassified from property, plant and equipment to provisions within the deferred tax disclosure note. A net deferred tax liability of £42.3m arose on the acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Limited, and a net deferred tax liability of £237.4m arose on the acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited and subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences giving rise to deferred tax assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered, with the exception of certain capital losses. A deferred tax asset of £69.3m (2022: £99.0m) has been recognised in relation to trading losses carried forward of £277.0m (2022 restated: £400.0m). A deferred tax asset of £82.9m (2022: £68.0m) is also recognised in relation to disallowed interest carried forward under the UK Corporate Interest Restriction of £332.0m (2022: £272.0m). The utilisation of these assets is dependent upon future taxable profits, which we expect to arise through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. These attributes can be carried forward indefinitely. Capital losses carried forward at 31 December 2023 are £66.7m, for which a deferred tax asset of £3.1m is recognised. No deferred tax asset is recognised in respect of £54.7m of these losses. As at 31 December 2022, capital losses were £68.6m, for which a deferred tax asset of £6.1m was recognised. No deferred tax asset was recognised in respect of £44.5m of these losses. Capital losses are not recognised where, at the balance sheet date, it is not considered probable that the losses will be used. The Group has not recognised a deferred tax asset in relation to unrealised capital losses on land. The unrealised loss on land is £1,606.4m (2022: £1,775.9m). The movement in the year is due to the reversal of land impairments, the sale-and-leaseback disposals (see note 10 for further detail on the sale-and-leaseback transaction), partially offset by the acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Limited. A deferred tax asset is not recognised as it is not considered probable that the losses could be used once realised. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) Deferred tax movement during the year:",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

On 1 April 2023, the standard rate of corporation tax increased to 25%. The deferred tax liability is calculated using the tax rate at which it is expected to unwind of 25%. (a) The prior year current tax expense in 2022 includes £40.3m relating to corporation tax reliefs claimed in the years ending 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2017. This tax together with interest of £9.0m was reimbursed by ASDA Holdings UK Limited (“AHUKL”) – a wholly-owned subsidiary of Walmart Inc. - under an indemnity it provided to the Group when AHUKL sold its interest in ASDA Group Limited on 16 February 2021. The total reimbursement income of £49.3m was included as reimbursement income in the income statement. This is non-taxable income for the Group. AHUKL settled this tax and interest directly on the Group's behalf and as such, no amounts are recorded in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows in respect of the settlement or the reimbursement. In May 2023, amendments were made to IAS 12 for income taxes. These amendments provide companies with a temporary mandatory relief from deferred tax accounting for the impact of the top-up tax, and introduce disclosure requirements in relation to Pillar Two. Pillar Two legislation has been enacted or substantively enacted in certain jurisdictions in which the Group operates. The legislation is effective for the Group’s financial year beginning 1 January 2024. The Group has performed an assessment of the potential exposure to Pillar Two income taxes. This assessment is based on the most recent information available regarding the financial performance of the constituent entities in the Group. Based on the assessment performed, the transitional safe harbour relief applies. Therefore, the Group does not expect an exposure to Pillar Two top-up taxes. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The value-in-use is calculated using the following methodology: - Estimates of future cashflow performance - the cash flow models are prepared based on the Group’s one- and three-year planning process and are extrapolated beyond three years using estimated long term average growth rate of 2.0% - The assumptions used in the cash flow forecasts reflect management’s current climate strategy - Discount rate - the pre-tax discount rates applied to the cash flow projections are between 8.1% and 8.9% (2022: 8.2% - 8.6%) - Allocation of all relevant central costs to each location on a reasonable and consistent basis Management have also considered the fair value of each CGU. For Freehold sites a vacant possession valuation was performed with the support of external property valuers. Key estimates in these valuations include market rental and yield assumptions. As discussed in note 1, the Directors have undertaken a detailed review of the Group’s application of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and updated the Group accounting policy in relation to testing for impairment of long-lived assets which has resulted in a prior year restatement of impairment recognised in the 2022 comparative period. This results in a pre-tax impairment charge at 31 December 2022 of £377.4m (comprising £232.8m of property, plant and equipment impairment and £144.6m of right-of-use asset impairment (see note 13)) of which £357.5m was not previously recorded in the 2022 financial statements and a net pre-tax impairment reversal of £225.7m (comprising £148.9m of property, plant and equipment impairment and £76.8m of right-of-use asset impairment (see note 13)) being recorded in the Income Statement in 2023. This is consistent with a material year on year improvement in the Group’s financial performance in 2023 and an improvement in the Directors’ outlook of future cashflows compared to equivalent forecasts at 31 December 2022. The Group have considered the risks and opportunities facing the business in assessing the sensitivities to the value in use calculation and determined that the calculation is most sensitive to change in the discount rate and long-term growth rate: _Discount rate_ - For the year ended 31 December 2022, an increase in the discount rate by 1%, would result in an additional impairment of £51.7m and a decrease in the discount rate by 1%, would result in a reduction in the impairment for the year ended 31 December 2022 of £48.5m. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) Both the operational and non-operational estate are regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment.

Leases of land and buildings have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights, however they commonly include either a market rent review or index linked rent review with a cap and collar. The timing of when rent reviews take place differs for each lease. They have no purchase options. As discussed in note 1, the Directors have undertaken a detailed review of the Group’s application of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets and updated the Group accounting policy in relation to testing for impairment of long-lived assets which has resulted in a prior year restatement of impairment recognised in the 2022 comparative period. This results in a pre-tax impairment charge allocated to right-of-use assets at 31 December 2022 of £144.6m, of which £137.7m was not previously recorded in the financial statements and a net pre-tax impairment reversal of £76.8m being recorded in the Income Statement in 2023. See note 1 and note 12 for further details on impairment policy and assumptions. In determining the impairment of right-of-use assets management have calculated the fair value of right-of-use assets using a discounted market rental approach to determine the recoverable amount of the asset. This approach requires an estimates of market rentals using assumptions on market participant demand and rental yields alongside a discount rate which is determined in line with the Group’s incremental borrowing rate under IFRS 16. For details of sensitivity analysis of impairment charges see note 12. Average remaining lease term is 35 years (2022: 37 years). Leases of plant, vehicles and equipment have various terms but typically do not include mid-term rent reviews or extension options. They have no purchase options. The average remaining lease term is 4 years (2022: 4 years). Additions during the year relate primarily to the sale-and-leaseback of 25 stores (see note 10); renewals or modifications of previously existing leases for land and buildings; and new leases for plant, vehicles and equipment.

It was determined that this asset met the criteria for being classed as held for sale. The asset held for sale has been recognised at fair value less cost to sell. _Disposal of Arthur Foodstores Limited (“Arthur”) stores_ On 30 May 2023, the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) accepted undertakings to dispose of 13 stores owned by Arthur Foodstores Limited for which it expected a substantial lessening of competition were the Group to own and operate these stores. These 13 stores have been classified as held for sale from 30 May 2023 as the Directors have determined that: - the stores are available for immediate sale in their present condition; and - the sale is highly probable as the stores are being actively marketed at a price that is reasonable in relation to their estimated current fair values and; - there is an expectation that the sales process will be completed within one year from the date of classification. As the store assets were recognised as held for sale on acquisition, they have been recognised at fair value less cost to sell. In the year ended 31 December 2023, 2 of the 13 properties previously held for sale had been disposed of and a £6.6m loss, including allocated goodwill of £6.5m, was recognised on sale.

These brands have been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2023 in combination with other long-lived assets utilised in the ASDA and George business by assessing the present value of forecasted cash flows arising from the business. The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period. For cashflows arising out of the grocery, clothing and general merchandising activities of the business, forecasts are extrapolated beyond three years using estimated long term average growth rates. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8.9% (post-tax 6.7%) alongside a long term growth rate of 2.0%. For cashflows arising out of ASDA’s fuel retailing business, the cashflow forecast includes an assumed decline in sales volumes beyond the three-year forecast with an accompanying unwind of working capital over the medium term due to an expected transition to alternative fuel vehicles. In line with guidance in IAS 36, these forecasts do not include cashflows arising out of expansionary capital expenditure. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the fuel retailing cash flow projections is 11.4% (post-tax 8.5%). Based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis undertaken, management believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be lower than the carrying value of the brands and other long-lived assets used in the ASDA and George business.

This comprised initial cash consideration of £423.6m, of which £228.6m was funded from cash in hand and £195.0m was raised through the issue of additional senior facilities of £200.0m, less bank fees of £5.0m; and a loan balance owing to Arthur Foodstores Limited of £38.2m. Prior to completion of the acquisition, the seller owed a balance of £38.2m to Arthur Foodstores Limited. This liability was novated to the Group on completion at 29 October 2022 as part of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. The final purchase price for Arthur Foodstores Limited was £457.4m, as a result of a £4.4m post-completion adjustment comprising a reduction of £8.8m in the Group's payable to Arthur Foodstores Limited offset by £4.4m additional cash consideration which was paid prior to 30 May 2023, when control was deemed to have transferred to the Group. On 26 October 2022 the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order (“IEO”) under section 72 (2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Asda Stores Limited; Asda Group Limited; Mr Mohsin Issa; Mr Zuber Issa; TDR Capital LLP; TDR Capital III Portfolio No. 2 L.P.; TDR Capital III Investments (2019) L.P.; Co-operative Group Limited and Arthur Foodstores Limited. The IEO commenced on 30 October 2022. The IEO required the Group to hold separate the Arthur business. An independent management team was appointed to run the Arthur business during the IEO period and the parties were prohibited from performing any integration activities or exchanging of commercially sensitive information. At 31 December 2022, as a result of the IEO restrictions, the Group concluded that it did not have control of Arthur Foodstores Limited and therefore the results of the business were not consolidated in the 2022 financial statements. On 14 March 2023 the CMA delivered its Phase 1 decision in respect of its investigation into the Group’s acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Ltd. They identified 13 potential areas for competition concern, with the potential for local remedies. The Group offered to dispose of the 13 sites in question. On 30 May 2023 these undertakings were accepted by the CMA, and the IEO was lifted. Control is deemed to have transferred to the Group on 30 May 2023 and Arthur Foodstores has been consolidated from this date in these financial statements. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a trade or other receivable to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A trade or other receivable is written off to the Consolidated Income Statement when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows. The non-current intercompany receivable balance of £773.2m (2022: £747.4m) has arisen largely from the sale-and-leaseback transaction that occurred in 2021, as properties owned by the Group were sold to a fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent undertaking in exchange for an intercompany receivable balance for which the counterparty is Bellis Midco 2 Limited - a fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent, which itself owns a 100% interest in the Group. This receivable matures on 23 June 2026 and attracts on interest rate of 3.45%. See note 30 for further detail. In order to assess the probability of default and to determine the value of expected credit losses in respect of the Group’s intercompany receivables, the directors have modelled an orderly settlement of all intercompany balances between entities within the Group and entities outside the Group which are fellow wholly-owned subsidiaries of the ultimate parent. This analysis is based on the directors’ forecast of future cashflows. Downside sensitivities to the base case assumptions within this forecast have been modelled and in all scenarios, the value of cashflows realised is sufficient to enable full and orderly settlement of all balances. As such, the directors have determined that the probability of default in relation to the Group’s intercompany receivables is remote and the impact of expected credit losses is immaterial. Accordingly, the carrying value of the Group’s expected credit losses provision in respect of intercompany receivables is less than £0.1m (2022: less than £0.1m). In the prior year, loans receivable of £26.6m included a balance of £23.6m arising out of cash lent to Arthur Foodstores Limited, largely in order to enable that entity to satisfy short-term working capital requirements; and a further balance of £3.0m which was transferred to the Group on 29 October 2022. These balances were assessed to determine the value of ECLs as per the requirements of IFRS 9 and the impact in the prior year was less than £0.1m.

Further details of external borrowings are disclosed in note 22. During the year, the Group extended the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) which was entered into in a previous year, from a limit of £500.0m to a limit of £667.3m. The RCF expires in August 2025. The carrying amount of RCF fees at 31 December 2023 was £5.5m, which includes £2.5m in relation to the RCF extension entered into during the year (2022: £5.1m). Amortisation of £2.1m (2022: £2.1m) was charged in the year. On 31 October 2023, the Group entered into a loan of £683.9m to part-fund the acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited (“EG”). This loan attracts interest per annum of 6.75% plus SONIA. The loan matures on 31 October 2029 and has therefore been classified as non-current. In addition, the Group entered into a bridge facility of £290.0m to part-fund the acquisition of EG. The bridge facility attracted interest per annum of 7.0% plus SONIA. The facility was repaid in full on 21 December 2023. On 12 December 2023, the Group entered into a Corporate Ground Rent transaction and received a £400.0m loan. The loan is split into Facility A and Facility B which attract interest per annum of 3.79% and 3.97% respectively. The facility matures in December 2073 and has therefore been classified as non-current. The £409.1m non-current shareholder loan balance comprises of a £401.0m subordinated shareholder loan used to partially fund the acquisition of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited and £8.1m interest accrued on this balance. Total lease cash outflow in the year was £350.3m (2022: £300.4m). Amounts included in financing activities in the cash flow statement are cash payments for the principal portion of the lease liability £148.5m (2022: £131.9m) and cash payments for the interest portion of the lease liability of £175.9m (2022: £145.2m). £25.9m (2022: £23.3m) has been included in operating activities in the cash flow statement and relates to short term and variable lease expenses. During the prior year, the Group had access to a facility that provided the Group with a credit facility pursuant to which payment to the relevant beneficiaries and suppliers is made by ASDA Stores Limited using the facility on the relevant invoice due date, with ASDA Stores Limited then settling these liabilities in the normal course of business. An amount of £39.1m was outstanding on this facility at 31 December 2022 and was fully repaid during the current year. The Group no longer utilises this facility and the balance at 31 December 2023 was £nil. On 24 July 2022, the Group entered into a framework agreement in respect of a short-term financing facility.

Part of the security pledged is in relation to some of the Group’s existing supply chain finance agreements in the form of fixed and floating charges over certain of the Group’s assets. There were no other changes to the terms of these supply chain finance agreements which impact on the nature of amounts owed to the bank under these arrangements. Given consideration of this and the other factors set out in note 1, the Directors have concluded that the substance of the Group’s liabilities under all supply chain financing agreements remain consistent overall with that of a trade payable and accordingly will continue to be accounted for and classified as trade payables. On 13 August 2021, the Group entities that guarantee the Senior Secured Notes issued by Bellis Acquisition Company PLC, the Term Loan Facilities and the Forecourt Bridge Facility borrowed by Bellis Acquisition Company PLC and the Revolving Credit Facility made available to the Group granted first-priority security interests over their Material Real Property to secure their obligations under those instruments. With the completion of this security grant, the Group discharged the requirement to deliver post-closing collateral under the various financing arrangements established in connection with the acquisition of ASDA by the Group. Upon the issuance of additional Senior Secured Notes on 5 November 2021 by Bellis Acquisition Company PLC, the Group is required to grant further first-priority security interests over their Material Real Property to secure their obligations under these instruments. This grant of this security was completed on 5 May 2022. On 29 October 2023, an additional fixed charge on the existing security pledged over certain material bank accounts and the shares owned by the Group in ASDA Stores Limited, McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood House Group Limited was pledged in relation to the bridge facility agreement that was entered into by Bellis Acquisition Company PLC on the same date. On 20 December 2023, Asda Propco Limited, a subsidiary of the group, entered into a £400m loan facility agreement as part of a Corporate Ground Rent transaction. As part of this transaction 55 store properties, including leases back to Asda Stores Limited as tenant, have been transferred into Asda Propco Limited and a first floating charge over all property and assets of Asda Propco Limited has been granted to the lenders. ----- ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The Group has a risk management programme in place through which it seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of these market risks. In addition, the Group hedges interest and exchange rate exposure on foreign currency debt obligations and hedges interest rate risk on a proportion of its loan facilities with interest rates linked with SONIA. The Group does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. _Interest rate risk_ The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate liabilities (based on SONIA and EURIBOR) primarily composed of the Senior Facilities, which consist of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A, Term Loan B and an additional Term Loan entered into during the year. During the year, the Group was exposed to interest rate risk on the Arthur Additional Bridge Facility, this was settled in full on 23 October 2023. The EURIBOR interest rate risk on Facility B is hedged through entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps to fix the interest payments in pound sterling at rates between 3.70% - 3.76% which expired on 16 February 2024. The SONIA interest rate risk on the Term Loan entered into during the year is hedged through entering into interest rate swaps to fix a proportion of the interest payments at a fixed interest rate between 4.75% - 4.78% which expires on 16 November 2025. Interest on the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes is charged at fixed rates between 3.25% and 4.50%. The Group, after the impact of hedge accounting, is exposed to possible changes in SONIA on its outstanding floating rate loans (Term Loan A and a proportion of the Term Loan entered into during the year). It is anticipated that a 0.5% increase in the SONIA rate would give rise to an annualised decrease in profit before tax of £1.8m (2022: £1.2m). The Group’s Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities were impacted in the prior year by the interest rate benchmark reform. The Group transitioned these agreements to the new UK risk-free rate benchmark, SONIA, which was applied to the Group’s interest period starting 1 April 2022. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.188,21 Financial instruments (continued),215.188.5,,"As at 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022, all of the Group’s interest-bearing financial assets were denominated in Sterling at fixed rates of interest. The interest rate of interest-bearing receivables is 3.45% (2022: 3.45%). Intercompany receivables are disclosed in note 30. _Derivatives_ Forward contracts - these derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of forward contracts entered into and are split between in-the-money (assets) and out-of-the-money (liabilities). At 31 December 2023, the Group held £0.5m (2022: £24.0m) in-the-money assets, and £22.3m (2022: £17.3m) out-of-the-money liabilities in respect of its forward contracts. During the year, the Group recognised net gains on revaluation of hedged monetary liabilities from historical cost to period-end spot rate of £4.9m (2022: £2.7m loss). The fair values of the Group’s financial derivatives have been calculated at the observable unquoted interest rates and are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Cross-currency interest rate swaps - these derivatives are measured at fair value using a swap valuation model. The model incorporates various observable market inputs (Level 2) including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies and interest rate curves. The model incorporates a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative counter-party default risk. These derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of cross-currency interest rate swaps entered into and are split between in-the-money (assets) and out-of-the-money (liabilities). At 31 December 2023, the Group held £nil (2022: £36.0m assets) in-the-money assets, and £2.9m (2022: £nil) out-of-the-money liabilities in respect of its cross-currency interest rate swaps. Interest rate swaps - these derivatives are measured at fair value using a swap valuation model. The model incorporates various observable market inputs (Level 2) including the credit quality of counterparties and interest rate curves. The model incorporates a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative counter-party default risk. These derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of interest rate swaps entered into and are either in-the-month (assets) or out-of-the-month (liabilities). At 31 December 2023, the Group held £nil (2022: £nil) in-the-money assets and £6.4m (2022: £nil) out-of-the-money liabilities in respect of its interest rate swaps. _Investments- fair value through profit and loss - prior year_ The fair value of the investment in Arthur Foodstores Limited on initial recognition was considered to be the purchase price. Prior to acquiring the investment in Arthur Foodstores Limited the Directors performed a valuation exercise using a “market” (or “income”) approach. As the acquisition occurred in close proximity to 31 December 2023 and the Directors were not aware of any material changes to the underlying business, they were satisfied that the price paid equated to fair value at that date. Further detail is provided in the 2022 financial statements. Control of Arthur Foodstores Limited is deemed to have transferred to the Group on 30 May 2023 and as such, the results of Arthur Foodstores Limited have been consolidated from this date. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) _Foreign currency risk Forward currency hedging contracts_ The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are managed using forward contracts. The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31 December 2023, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of future purchases. The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a period of more than 18 months after 31 December 2023. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2023, a net unrealised loss of £12.2m (2022: £36.2m gain) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of hedging contracts. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of these hedging contracts was £15.8m (2022: £7.5m loss) and a gain of £32.6m was reclassified to retained earnings during the year (see note 26). This consists of a £36.3m loss (2022: £14.4m gain) on not-yet-matured contracts during the year, £15.3m of loss reclassified to the Income Statement during the year (2022: £23.4m gains) and a £5.2m taxation credit (2022: £1.5m credit). Under the Group’s hedging policy, forward currency contracts can be used for both goods for resale and goods not for resale. The only items for which forward currency contracts are in place as at 31 December 2023 are forecast purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 100% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the Income Statement at the point of sale. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash flows would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the year, therefore, amounts recognised in the Income Statement in relation to ineffective forward contract hedges is £nil (2022: £nil). At 31 December 2023, the Group held £1,234.4m (2022: £760.2m) of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts, designated as cash flow hedges. These forward contracts are largely in relation to purchases of US Dollars (notional $1,470.0m) and Euros (notional €71.4m) with varying maturities up to June 2025. For the above currencies the rates ranged from USD/GBP from 1.210 to 1.302 (2022: 1.098 to 1.369) and Euro/GBP 1.142 to 1.164 (2022: 1.132 to 1.157). As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure using forward currency contracts, changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short-term profitability or cash flow. It is anticipated that a 5% movement in the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of £47.2m (2022: £34.6m). ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) _Cross-currency swap_ The Group has entered into a floating rate Euro denominated Term Loan B. The non-GBP interest and principal repayment cash flows from the Euro debt agreement expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that impact the consolidated Income Statement. Under the Group’s hedging policy, the Group hedges both the foreign exchange and interest rate risk associated with a portion of the Group’s existing, Euro foreign-currency denominated debt using EUR-GBP cross currency interest rate swap contracts to effectively eliminate variability in the Group’s functional currency equivalent cash flows due to variability in the EUR-GBP exchange rate and the variable interest rate. The hedge ratio is 100% on a current notional basis. The Group has excluded from the cross-currency interest rate swap both the time value and currency basis elements of the cross-currency interest rate swap. Ineffectiveness could arise from movements in counterparty credit spread, the non-zero fair value at the hedge designation date due to market changes that have occurred since the instrument’s inception and changes to critical terms (e.g. reset dates, index mismatches, payment dates). To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the change in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. The amounts recognised in the Income Statement for the period ended 31 December 2023 relating to ineffectiveness and excluded items was £0.3m (2022: less than £0.1m). At 31 December 2023, the Group holds cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) with a total nominal value of €844.5m, designated as cash flow hedges. These swaps result in a fixed GBP interest rate ranging from 3.70% to 3.76% and EUR/GBP rate of 1.1412. On 16 February 2024 - following the expiration of the CCIRSs in place at the Balance Sheet date - the Group entered into new CCIRSs with an expiration date of 16 February 2025 with the same counterparty banks. This eliminates variability in the Group’s functional currency equivalent cash flows in relation to Term Loan B for the Group for the 12 month period to 16 February 2025 and fixes the interest rate on Term Loan B at fixed GBP interest rates of between 8.03% and 8.06%. The CCIRSs were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2023, a net unrealised gain of £3.1m (2022: £21.2m gain) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net loss recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve during the year in respect of these swaps was £18.1m (2022: £14.5m gain). This consists of a £2.6m gain reclassified to the Income Statement during the year (2022: £35.5m gain), a £21.8m loss (2022: £54.9m gain) on the fair value of the swaps at period end and a taxation credit of £6.3m (2022: £4.8m charge). The value of the CCIRSs are sensitive to movements in EURIBOR and EUR/GBP exchange rates. A 0.5% change in EURIBOR results in a £2.8m (2022: £2.9m) change in value of the CCIRSs and a 5% change in the EUR/GBP exchange rates results in a £40.2m (2022: £38.9m) change in the value of the CCIRSs. The amounts charged to the income statement are not sensitive to a change in interest rates but a 5% increase in the FX rate increases the amount of ineffectiveness by £nil (2022: £nil). _Interest rate swaps_ The Group has entered into a Term Loan with interest rates calculated based on SONIA. The variable interest rate exposes the Group to interest rate fluctuations that impact the consolidated Income Statement. At 31 December 2023, the Group holds interest rate swaps (IRS) with a total nominal value of £540.0m, designated as cash flow hedges. The hedge ratio is on a 79% current notional basis. These swaps result in a fixed GBP interest rate ranging from 11.50% to 11.53%. The IRSs were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2023, a net unrealised loss of £4.8m (2022: £nil) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of these swaps was £4.8m (2022: £nil). This consists of a £0.4m gain reclassified to the Income Statement during the year (2022: £nil), a £6.0m loss (2022: £nil) on the fair value of the swaps at year end and a taxation credit of £1.6m (2022: £nil). ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) The value of the IRSs are sensitive to movements in SONIA. A 0.5% change in SONIA results in a £10.9m (2022: £nil) change in value of the IRSs. _Credit risk_ The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is included in their carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date. See note 18 for further information on trade receivables and intercompany receivables and details of recoverability. The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default in relation to trade receivables including detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted. Surplus cash is placed in both short-term deposits and money market funds with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Group Treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit in keeping with internal objectives. This includes monitoring the credit rating of counterparties and investing in accordance with our internal policy. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed on a monthly basis, and may be updated throughout the financial year. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risk and are set taking into account the type of financial asset and the credit rating of the financial institution. Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses model under IFRS 9 and the impact is not material. As such, the provision for expected credit losses is less than £0.1m (2022: less than £0.1m). _Liquidity risk_ The Group’s Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash flows. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility using operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At 31 December 2023, the RCF and overdraft facilities are unutilised. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued) At 31 December 2023, the Group held cash of £1,027.7m (2022: £662.5m) to secure short-term flexibility. The amount of financing facilities available at the year end are disclosed below: _Capital risk management_ The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure may not be sufficient to support the growth of its business and maintain its existing credit rating. The capital structure of the Group consists of debt obligations (including the Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes, Term Loans and the Senior Unsecured Notes) and equity (issued share capital, share premium and reserves). Part of the Group's capital risk management strategy is to monitor a broad range of financial metrics and manage compliance with financial covenants relating to the Group's debt obligations. As at 31 December 2023, there have been no breaches of financial covenants.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Under the MIP, an intermediate holding company of the Group - Bellis Midco 2 Limited - has entered into an agreement with the holders of MIP management shares (“MIP scheme members”) whereby MIP scheme members are granted put options which, when exercised, enable them to sell their management shares to Bellis Midco 2 Limited or another non-Group entity for a value which is based on an independent valuation determined at the exercise date. MIP scheme members are required to be employed by the Group at the grant date of the MIP shares. If a member of the scheme ceases to be employed by the Group during the vesting period, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, a parent of Bellis Finco PLC, has the option to repurchase, or nominate another entity of the Group to repurchase, the shares during the 12 month period after the member’s leave date. As such, the Directors have determined that the MIP scheme falls within the scope of IFRS 2. The difference between the IFRS 2 fair value and the fair value paid by MIP scheme members at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period (i.e. the period from the date on which the MIP shares are granted to the estimated exercise date) as an expense in the consolidated Income Statement. As neither MIP shares nor put options over MIP shares are issued by entities within the Group, and as there is no recharge agreement in place which requires any entity within the Group to settle liabilities in respect of MIP shares, changes in the fair value of MIP shares are accounted for on an equity-settled basis. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The value of the provision is established using independent actuarial assessments or a reasonable estimate based on past experience. These provisions are expected to crystallise within 5 years. Insurance liabilities are not discounted as the impact would not be material. Where the Group settles insurance claims for which it has recourse to a third-party insurer, the amount due from the insurer is included within trade and other receivables. The carrying value of these amounts at 31 December 2023 is £nil (2022: £nil). The dilapidation provision represents provisions for the cost of works required to remove leasehold improvements within leasehold properties at the end of their lease term. The amount of the provision recognised is adjusted based on the length of the lease remaining to reflect the uncertainty in the value of the provision where a lease has a substantial remaining term (greater than 35 years). The amount provided during the year is accounted for as an increase or decrease in the cost of property, plant and equipment and the impact of this will be recognised as depreciation over the lease terms of the sites to which the provision relates. The increase in the year is due primarily to additions relating to the sale & leaseback transaction (see note 10), and liabilities acquired during the year relating to the leasehold property of Arthur Foodstores Limited and subsidiaries of Euro Garages (Jersey) Limited. A discount rate of 4.2% (2022: 4.0%) has been used in determining this provision. The provision will be utilised at the end of the respective terms of the leases giving rise to these liabilities. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

During the year, gains of £32.6m previously reclassified in the cash flow hedge reserve were reclassified to retained earnings. This amount relates to forward contract derivatives which were in place on 16 February 2021 - the date that the group acquired the entire issued share capital of ASDA Group Limited (“the acquisition date”). At the acquisition date, forward contracts entered into by ASDA Group Limited prior to that date were out of the money with a post-tax unrealised loss of £32.6m recognised as a net liability within the carrying value of net assets acquired by the Group on that date. This had the impact of reducing the bargain purchase gain recognised on the acquisition within the 2021 Income Statement (see 2021 financial statements for further detail). During the period between the acquisition date and 31 December 2021, realised losses on these contracts were recognised within cost of goods sold and tax expense with a corresponding gain recognised in the cash flow hedge reserve but as the unrealised losses were also recognised as a charge within the gain on bargain purchase, this resulted in an overstatement of the cash flow hedge reserve of £32.6m and a corresponding understatement of retained earnings of £32.6m at 31 December 2021. This has been corrected by transferring the amount from the cash flow hedge reserve to retained earnings in 2023 with no impact on total equity shareholders’ funds at 31 December 2023 or 31 December 2022, no impact on profit for the current or prior year, and no impact on net assets at 31 December 2023 or 31 December 2022. ----- #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2023 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The claims have been presented on behalf of current and former ASDA store employees, who allege that their work in ASDA's stores is of equal value in terms of the demands of their jobs to that of employees working in ASDA's distribution centres, and that the differences in pay and terms and conditions between the different jobs are not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the distribution centres and those higher wage rates and more favourable terms and conditions on a prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be served. At present, the Directors cannot predict the number of claims that may be served, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. There are three stages to these proceedings: - Comparability - on 26 March 2021, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision that the work of hourly-paid workers in distribution centres and the work of hourly-paid workers in stores can be compared. - Equal Value - this stage is a legal process to determine whether any of the claimants’ roles are of equal value to any of the comparator roles. A court hearing on this stage of the proceedings is scheduled to commence on 9 September 2024. - Material Factor Defence - if it is established that any roles are of equal value, there will be a further legal process to determine whether there are objective, non-discriminatory reasons for these differentials in pay and other terms. At the balance sheet date and the date of approval of the accounts, the proceedings are at the Equal Value stage. The Directors believe that there are substantial factual and legal defences to these claims and intend to defend the claims vigorously. No provision continues to be recognised on the basis that any potential liability is only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. Following the acquisition by the Group of the entire issued share capital of ASDA Group Limited (the immediate parent of ASDA Stores Limited) on 16 February 2021, the Group has entered into an indemnification agreement which is guaranteed by a wholly owned subsidiary of the former ultimate parent of ASDA Stores Limited, Walmart Inc. (""Walmart"") with respect to these claims.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). ## Basis for opinion #### We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the group and parent company in accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our ----- #### audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. ## Conclusions relating to going concern #### In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group’s and the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included: • Determining whether in our judgement the process applied by management in making their assessment of going concern, including supporting cash flow forecasts to 30 June 2024 and covenant compliance calculations, was fit for purpose. • Assessing key assumptions used both in the base case and in the severe but plausible downside scenario forecasts by reference to historical data and external market perspectives. • Assessing whether we considered the downside sensitivities to be appropriately severe in the current retail grocery market; • Corroborating key assumptions in the group forecasts (e.g. market share, product price, mix and volume, cost inflation and finance costs) to other evidence including external research, historical performance and internal sector specialists, and ensuring this was consistent with our audit work in other areas; • Testing the mathematical accuracy of management’s cash flow models; • Reperforming the group’s covenant compliance test calculations to determine if the covenant tests apply in the base case or downside scenarios; • For the strategic growth option modelled by management, performing the same procedures as outlined above for the related base case and downside scenarios plus a further assessment of the related financing structure and terms required to provide sufficient liquidity and covenant headroom; • Assessing the Directors’ and Shareholders’ commitment through a Board resolution to only progress the most advanced strategic option if the terms of the funding were within prescribed boundaries that would not cause a breach of facilities under the various scenarios modelled; and • Reviewing the disclosures in the financial statements relating to the going concern basis of preparation and evaluating that these provided an explanation of the Directors’ assessment that was consistent with the audit evidence we obtained. As part of the governance processes documented by the Board, there is a commitment to only progress the most advanced strategic option with funding arrangements that will secure adequate liquidity and covenant headroom through the going concern review period. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period to 30 June 2024. Going concern has also been determined to be a key audit matter. ----- #### Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this conclusion is not a guarantee as to the group’s and the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. ## Overview of our audit approach Audit scope** - We performed an audit of the complete financial information of three components. - The components where we performed full audit procedures accounted for 100% of adjusted EBITDA, 100% of revenue and 100% of total assets.",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Taken together, this enables us to form an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We take into account size, risk profile, the organisation of the group and effectiveness of group wide controls, changes in the business environment, and other factors such as recent Internal audit results when assessing the level of work to be performed at each company. In assessing the risk of material misstatement to the group financial statements, and to ensure we had adequate quantitative coverage of significant accounts in the financial statements, of the three reporting components of the group, we selected all components covering entities in the UK, which represent the principal business units within the group. Of the three components selected, we performed an audit of the complete financial information of all components (“full scope components”) which were selected based on their size or risk characteristics. The three full scope reporting components where we performed audit procedures accounted for 100% (2021:100%) of the group’s adjusted EBITDA, 100% (2021: 100%) of the group’s revenue and 100% (2021: 100%) of the group’s total assets. Our scoping is consistent with the prior year. ### Involvement with component teams #### All audit work performed for the purposes of the audit was undertaken by the group audit team. ## Climate change #### Stakeholders are increasingly interested in how climate change will impact Bellis Finco plc. The group has determined that the most significant future impacts from climate change will be physical risk and the impact it could have on operations, property and supply chain. This is disclosed as part of ----- #### the principal risks and uncertainties on page 44 which form part of the “Other information,” rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these unaudited disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated, in line with our responsibilities on “Other information”. In planning and performing our audit we assessed the potential impacts of climate change on the group’s business and any consequential material impact on its financial statements. The group has explained in in the Basis of Preparation their consideration of climate change and its impact on their financial statements. These disclosures also explain where governmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, and where the degree of certainty of these changes means that they cannot be taken into account when determining asset valuations and the timing of future cashflows under UK adopted international accounting standards. Our audit effort in considering the impact of climate change on the financial statements was focused on evaluating management’s assessment of the impact of climate risk have been reflected in the valuation of long-lived assets. We also challenged the Directors’ considerations of climate change risks in their assessment of going concern and associated disclosures. Based on our work we have not identified the impact of climate change on the financial statements to be a key audit matter or to impact a key audit matter. ## Key audit matters #### Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified. These matters include those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. ----- Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) that we identified.

Total supplier income recognised in the period is in the form of Volume agreements and Fixed agreements. We consider the Fixed agreements to have a higher degree of subjectivity as they are manual in nature and can be retrospective, compared to the Volume agreements and therefore our risk procedures are focused on these types of agreements. _Our response to the risk_ We performed full scope audit procedures over the risk area which covered all the risk amount. We performed the following procedures: - We performed a walk through of the process to recognise supplier income and tested key controls within this process; - We obtained a download from the supplier income system and using a bespoke analyser performed targeted analytic procedures to identify unusual items; - We selected a sample of agreements and performed independent confirmation of the key terms with the suppliers. Where we did not receive a response we obtained the signed supplier agreement and validated that the terms had been recorded correctly in the system and the amounts recognised to date were in line with those terms; - We performed inquiry with buyers independently to corroborate or identify any contrary evidence to the explanations we had obtained from finance; - We performed margin analysis at a department level to identify any unusual trends which could suggest a change in supplier income terms, or undue pressure on the department. We used this to corroborate our findings from the analytic tool and to ensure completeness around any unusual items Using data extracted from the system we analysed the booking pattern for supplier income journals and investigated any material exceptions to the expected booking pattern. This allowed us to consider the whole population and focus on unusual journal pairings; and, - We tested the existence and valuation of balance sheet amounts recognised in accounts receivable by tracing through to post year end settlement or through contra-asset payments within accounts payables. _Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee_ Based on our audit procedures we have concluded that the supplier income recognised in the period is appropriate. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

There is a risk of inappropriate cut-off around early or late funding, or false recognition of supplier income due back from suppliers.",215.253.1,,"We performed full scope audit procedures over this risk area on one component which covered 100% of the total amount. We performed the following procedures: - We reviewed and challenged the appropriateness of the group’s supplier income accounting policies - We performed walkthroughs of the supplier income process and identified and tested the operating effectiveness of key controls within the process - We tested and relied on management’s IT general controls across the supplier income IT application - We used data analytics to perform analytic procedures across the entire population of both fixed and volume agreements to identify unusual trends, material supplier agreements, and potential late adjustments. We then tested these outliers through to underlying agreements and validated that the accounting was correct and that the agreements had been appropriately approved in line with policy - We analysed the margin across different operating departments to identify any unusual changes. We sought explanations for these movements and corroborated to external support where possible (i.e. to macroeconomic conditions) - We held meetings with buyers across key departments to understand significant agreements and the impact they had on the overall ----- performance of that department - We performed a correlation analysis to confirm that the flow of transactions through the income statement and balance sheet is complete and accurately recorded - We obtained confirmations from a sample of material vendors to confirm key terms back to signed agreements - Certain supplier agreements have the right to be offset against accounts payable. We substantively tested that where balances had been offset, that right existed within the agreement and was therefore appropriate. - We tested material funding received post year end to ensure it was accounted for in the correct period. #### In the prior year, our auditor’s report also included two additional key audit matters in relation to Purchase Price Allocation and Sale and Leaseback. In the current year, these are no longer key audit matters as these transactions were specific to the prior year. ## Our application of materiality #### We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. ### Materiality #### The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures. We determined materiality for the group to be £25 million (2021: £34 million), which is 2.3% of adjusted EBITDA (2021: 5% of adjusted EBIT). We believe that adjusted EBITDA provides us with an appropriate basis for materiality and is the most relevant measure for stakeholders. The adjusted EBITDA has been adjusted to add back the separation costs related to the IT transformation project of £188.7m which we consider to be non-recurring and we have excluded the receipt of the indemnification income of £49.3m which we also consider to be non-recurring. In the prior year, we used adjusted EBIT as the basis for materiality. In the current year, adjusted EBITDA has been established as the key performance indicator that is used with external and internal stakeholders. ----- #### We determined materiality for the parent company to be £25 million (2021: £27 million) which is 1.8% of equity (2021: 2% of equity). During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and no change from our original assessment at planning was required. ### Performance materiality #### The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality. On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% (2021: 75%) of our planning materiality, namely £19m (2021: £25m). We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to there being limited factors present that indicate a higher likelihood that misstatements may occur. Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component.  In the current year, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £5m to £19m (2021: £5m to £25m). ### Reporting threshold #### An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £1m (2021: £2m), which is set at 5% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion. ## Other information #### The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 4-58, other than the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information contained within the annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial statements themselves. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. ----- ## Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 #### In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit: • the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and • the strategic report and directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements. ## Matters on which we are required to report by exception #### In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report. We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion: • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or • the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or • certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit ## Responsibilities of directors #### As explained more fully in the directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 59, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. ## Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements #### Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. ----- #### Explanation as to what extent the audit was considered capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the company and management. • We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the group and determined that the most significant are those that relate to the reporting framework (UK adopted International Accounting Standards for the group and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice for the parent) and the relevant tax laws and regulations in the UK. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements being those laws and regulations relating to health and safety and employee matters. • We understood how Bellis Finco plc is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of group management, group Legal & Compliance, and Internal Audit. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers and inspection of commentary in the group management accounts, and understanding the processes and controls they had in place to monitor compliance, as well as observations in Audit Committee meetings and consideration of the results of our audit procedures across the group. • We assessed the susceptibility of the group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was a susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from material fraud and error. • Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations, including where necessary forensics specialists. Our procedures involved journal entry testing on the full population of journals, with a focus on manual consolidation journals, and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of group management, group Legal, group Ethics & Compliance, and Internal Audit. In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in the group Financial Statements with the requirements of the relevant accounting standards, and UK legislation. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s report. ----- ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Consolidated Income Statement for the Year Ended 31 December 2022",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

In preparing the Group’s Consolidated Financial statements management has considered the impact of climate change for the purposes of the going concern assessment, and the disclosures included in the Strategic report. This assessment did not identify any material risks arising from climate change, accordingly there has been no material impact on the cashflow forecasts used to assess the going concern basis. Furthermore, our forecasts for going concern do not include any material profitability impact in relation to climate change. The Group will keep this assessment under review and continue to monitor developments in the future. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

In assessing the Group’s ability to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have reviewed the Group's annual corporate planning process which includes profitability, cashflow and liquidity forecasting and have based their projections for the going concern period on the FY23 plan and the FY24 forecasts from the three-year planning process. The Group’s Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash flows and maintaining a sufficient level of standby facilities via the Revolving Credit Facility. Any capital repayments of long-term financing are forecast in the cash flow model used in the going concern scenarios. The Revolving Credit Facility remains undrawn at the year end and no utilisation is forecast in the base case cash flow model. For more information on liquidity risk and maturity of financial liabilities see note 19. In assessing the Group’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have tested the ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due from the date of approval of the accounts to 30 June 2024, in the event of various cash flow scenarios, including a severe but plausible downside scenario. This scenario applies severe but plausible economic downsides to our base case forecast, modelling the impact of a decline of the Group’s participation in the UK grocery market compared to planned growth alongside the risk of fuel margin decline, inflationary pressures and risk of not achieving forecast levels of cost transformation activities. Furthermore, the Directors have considered the likely impacts on the business of levels of geo-political instability and uncertainty arising out of external events which are ongoing at the date of approval of the financial statements. The Directors are satisfied that the potential economic impacts of these events are adequately taken into account in the severe but plausible downside scenario. Mitigating actions that are in the control of management have been considered such as reducing non-essential capital expenditure and discretionary spend. These mitigating actions are not required to be implemented to ensure sufficient headroom in the severe but plausible downside scenario. In the severe but plausible downside scenario the maximum utilisation of the RCF is 4%. Where management do not implement any mitigating actions the maximum utilisation of the RCF is 31%. The Directors consider that a scenario with no mitigating actions is not realistic as all modelled mitigating actions are readily accessible. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key judgements, estimates and assumptions impacting the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed further below. _Judgements Business combinations - acquisition date relating to the Group's purchase of the share capital of Arthur Foodstores Limited (current year)_ On 29 October 2022, Asda Stores Limited - a wholly owned subsidiary of Bellis Finco plc - purchased 100% of the share capital of Arthur Foodstores Limited, a grocery retailer operating in the United Kingdom for an initial purchase price of £461.8m. This comprises initial cash consideration of £423.6m, of which £228.6m has been funded from cash in hand and £195.0m has been raised through the issue of additional senior facilities of £200.0m, less bank fees of £5.0m; and a balance owed to Arthur Foodstores Limited of £38.2m. Prior to completion of the acquisition, the seller owed a balance of £38.2m to Arthur Foodstores Limited. This liability was novated to the Group on completion at 29 October 2022 as part of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. On 26 October 2022 the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order (“IEO”) under section 72 (2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Asda Stores Limited; Asda Group Limited; Mr Mohsin Issa; Mr Zuber Issa; TDR Capital LLP; TDR Capital III Portfolio No. 2 L.P.; TDR Capital III Investments (2019) L.P.; Co-operative Group Limited and Arthur Foodstores Limited. The IEO commenced on 30 October 2022. The IEO requires the Group to effectively ‘hold separate’ the Arthur business, an independent management team has been appointed to run the Arthur business during the IEO period and the parties are prohibited from performing any integration activities or exchanging of commercially sensitive information. As at 31 December 2022, as a result of the IEO restrictions, the Group has concluded that it does not have control of Arthur Foodstores Limited and therefore the results of the business are not consolidated in these financial statements. The Group expects to obtain control over Arthur Foodstores Limited from the date that the IEO is lifted, unless there are significant derogations from the CMA entered into before this date which provide evidence of the Group obtaining control. From the date control is obtained, Arthur Foodstores Limited will be consolidated into the Group accounts. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) Management are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key judgements, estimates and assumptions impacting the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed further below. _Judgements IFRS 16 lease term_ IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the period covered by options to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option, and the period covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise the option. The Group applies judgement to whether an extension should be added to the non-cancellable lease term with reference to the following: - Extension options in the contract. Consideration as to whether any option is reasonably certain to be exercised is based on whether an economic incentive exists to do so. This incentive is assessed by reference to multiple factors including but not limited to current operational performance of the site and future performance projections, length of time to the option exercise date and future capital requirements. The majority of the Group's leases do not have extension options in the contract but, where they do, most lease terms include the extension period. - Geographical factors. A term extension on any lease for sites in England and Wales may be judged reasonably certain on the basis of security of tenure if an economic incentive to remain in the lease beyond the contractual term is deemed to exist. This incentive is assessed by reference to the same factors listed above. If an extension is judged reasonably certain, the typical additional term applied is 10 years. Geographical factors are not considered for sites outside England and Wales. In the event of changing circumstances or new information that may impact judgements taken, lease terms will be re-assessed on a lease by lease basis. A quarterly review is performed to identify where re-assessments may be required. Any change in lease term could result in a recalculation of the lease liability and a material adjustment to the associated right-of-use asset. There are no examples of term reassessment in the period. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Following initial recognition, the historic cost model is applied, with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets include software costs. Software costs capitalised consist of both costs from third parties and costs of internal resources involved in development activities. When considering whether software costs can be capitalised, the Directors perform an assessment of whether the Group controls the underlying asset. Factors considered when assessing whether the Group controls an asset include where and how the software is hosted and the ability the Group has to make changes to the software. Costs are only capitalised once a project is in the development stage and approval for the project as a whole to be completed has been obtained. Costs incurred in the research stage are expensed as incurred. Integration costs between different software is capitalised where it can be demonstrated that these are separate intangible assets and control is evident. In relation to Software as a Service (“SAAS”) contracts, where it cannot be demonstrated that the Group controls the underlying assets' development, costs incurred are immediately recognised as an expense in the Consolidated Income Statement other than software licence fees which are included in prepaid expenses and amortised over the period of the respective licence. The factors noted above in relation to how the software is hosted and whether the Group has the ability to make or direct changes directly to the underlying software as part of the SAAS contract are considered as part of this assessment. Where implementation costs are incurred as part of a SAAS contract, these implementation costs are separately considered to identify whether they represent an intangible asset in their own right as detailed above. If the Directors conclude that the implementation costs do not meet the recognition criteria of a separate intangible asset, an assessment is then made as to whether the costs represent configuration of the software product or customisation. If configuration, these costs are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement as incurred, whereas if customisation the Directors will assess whether these should be recognised over the term of the SAAS contract if they are not distinct from the underlying software product itself. Purchases of new hardware are capitalised as Property, Plant and Equipment and so would not be included in intangibles. Costs associated with interim software solutions which do not meet the Group’s policy of a 3 year minimum useful economic life are expensed as incurred. Brand licences are capitalised when acquired as part of a business combination if they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights. A brand licence is initially measured at fair value using an appropriate valuation methodology (e.g. relief-from-royalty approach). Brand licences are not amortised where they have an indefinite useful life. Costs in relation to internally generated brands are not capitalised. Customer relationships are capitalised when acquired as part of a business combination if they are separable or arise from contractual or other legal rights. A customer relationship is initially measured at fair value using an appropriate valuation methodology (e.g. multi-period excess earnings method). Customer relationships are amortised over their useful economic life of 10 years. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) Intangible assets acquired are carried initially at cost.

Further sale-and-leasebacks for two depots were completed on 24 June 2021 and 14 October 2021 respectively. The properties were sold at fair value to a related party, Bellis Select Warehouse Limited (BSWL), prior to disposal to a third party. In accordance with IFRS 15, it was determined that the transfer of the distribution properties to BSWL for proceeds of £1,675.0m is considered a sale. In the period ended 31 December 2021, assets relating to the distribution properties with a Net Book Value of £831.3m were sold to BSWL and the Group recognised a gain on sale of £279.1m representing the amount of the gain that relates to the rights transferred to the buyer-lessor during the prior period. The remaining gain of £564.6m was deferred as a reduction to the right-of-use asset relating to the leaseback. On 13 July, 22 July and 21 October 2021, the distribution properties that were transferred to Bellis Select Warehouse Limited were sold for £1,675.0m to third party entities controlled by Blackstone Group Inc. These properties were leased back to the Group on terms ranging from 18 months to 35 years (including the assumption that leases will be extended by 10 years, consistent with the assumptions set out in note 1). The Group continues to lease these properties from entities controlled by Blackstone Group Inc. and has adjusted the right of use assets and lease liabilities to reflect amended terms of the leases on transfer to the third-party entities at that date. The leasebacks of the depots, taking into account the deferral of a proportion of the disposal gain into the right-of-use asset and subsequent modification to the lease term, resulted in an increase in right-of-use assets of £624.9m and lease liabilities of £1,177.4m in the prior period. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

On 3 March 2021, it was announced in the UK Budget that the main rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom will increase to 25% on 1 April 2023, and this rate change was substantively enacted in May 2021. The deferred tax liability is calculated using the tax rate at which it is expected to unwind (of between 19% and 25% for 2021 and 2022). The tax charge in relation to the rate change in the prior period is £280.9m. The future increase in tax rates to 25% was substantively enacted in the prior period and the full deferred tax liability was revalued to reflect this rate change. The rate change credit of £17m mostly relates to new deferred tax assets arising in the year for trading losses and for interest disallowed under the Corporate Interest Restriction to be reactivated in future years (interest carried forward). (a) Adjustments in respect of previous years of £46.0m includes a tax expense of £40.3m relating to corporation tax reliefs claimed in the years ending 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2017. This tax together with interest of £9.0m was reimbursable by a wholly-owned subsidiary of ASDA Holdings UK Limited's (""AHUKL's"") ultimate parent under an indemnity it provided on the sale of ASDA (note 2). The total reimbursement income of £49.3m is included as other income in the income statement. This is non-taxable income for the Group. A wholly-owned subsidiary of AHUKL's ultimate parent settled this tax and interest directly on the Group's behalf. (b) The prior period tax credit in relation to the sale-and-leaseback of the Group’s distribution properties was £74.2m. A tax credit arose on the transaction, despite an accounting gain of £279.1m. The tax on the chargeable gain on disposal (after the offset of capital losses) was £74.0m, of which £65.2m was recognised in the prior period. However, a deferred tax asset of £139.4m arose where the accounting gain on the disposal of fixed assets was deferred as a reduction of the right-of-use asset of the leaseback, as the full proceeds were taxed as a capital gain. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) Capital losses carried forward at 31 December 2022 are £68.6m (2021: £20.1m) of which £24.1m (2021: £7.0m) are recognised and £44.5m (2021: £13.1m) are unrecognised. Capital losses are not recognised where, at the balance sheet date, it is not considered probable that the losses will be used. The increase in capital losses in 2022 relates to the finalisation of the chargeable gains calculations for the sale and leaseback in 2021. In 2022, £5.0m of capital losses were used. Capital losses can be carried forward indefinitely. A deferred tax asset has been recognised at 31 December 2022 in relation to trading losses carried forward of £220.5m and disallowed interest carried forward under the UK Corporate Interest Restriction of £195.5m. The utilisation of these assets is dependent upon future taxable profits, which we expect to arise through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.

Leases of land and buildings have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights, however they commonly include either a market rent review or index linked rent review with a cap and collar. The timing of when rent reviews take place differs for each lease. They have no purchase options. Impairment charges of £6.9m (2021: £nil) were recognised during the year. The impairment charge in the year is driven primarily by declining performance of two sites. Average remaining lease term is 37 years (2021: 32 years). This figure is a weighted average which is calculated using undiscounted future lease payments whereas the prior period figure was calculated using discounted future lease payments. Due to the increase in discount rates during the year, the Directors believe that a weighted average lease term based on undiscounted payments is more representative and the calculation has been updated accordingly. The weighted average lease term at 31 December 2021 using undiscounted future lease payments would have been 38 years. Leases of plant, vehicles and equipment have various terms but typically do not include mid-term rent reviews or extension options. They have no purchase options. The average remaining lease term is 4 years (2021: 4 years). Included within prior period additions of £742.0m is £624.9m relating to the sale and leaseback transaction. This is stated net of a £564.6m deferral of the gain on sale. The remaining additions related to renewals or modifications of previously existing leases for land and buildings, new leases for plant, vehicles and equipment, alongside modifications to the lease term on the sale and leaseback properties.

This comprises initial cash consideration of £423.6m, of which £228.6m has been funded from cash in hand and £195.0m has been raised through the issue of additional senior facilities of £200.0m, less bank fees of £5.0m; and a loan balance owing to Arthur Foodstores Limited of £38.2m. Prior to completion of the acquisition, the seller owed a balance of £38.2m to Arthur Foodstores Limited. This liability was novated to the Group on completion at 29 October 2022 as part of the Sale and Purchase Agreement. On 26 October 2022 the Competition and Markets Authority (“CMA”) served an initial enforcement order (“IEO”) under section 72 (2) of the Enterprise Act 2002 on Asda Stores Limited; Asda Group Limited; Mr Mohsin Issa; Mr Zuber Issa; TDR Capital LLP; TDR Capital III Portfolio No. 2 L.P.; TDR Capital III Investments (2019) L.P.; Co-operative Group Limited and Arthur Foodstores Limited. The IEO commenced on 30 October 2022. The IEO requires the Group to effectively ‘hold separate’ the Arthur business. An independent management team has been appointed to run the Arthur business during the IEO period and the parties are prohibited from performing any integration activities or exchanging of commercially sensitive information. At 31 December 2022, as a result of the IEO restrictions, the Group has concluded that it does not have control of Arthur Foodstores Limited and therefore the results of the business are not consolidated in these financial statements. The Group expects to obtain control over Arthur Foodstores Limited from the date that the IEO is lifted, unless there are significant derogations from the CMA entered into before this date which provide evidence of the Group obtaining control. From the date control is obtained, Arthur Foodstores Limited will be consolidated into the Group accounts. On 14 March 2023 the CMA delivered its Phase 1 decision in respect of its investigation into the Group’s acquisition of Arthur Foodstores Ltd. They identified 13 potential areas for competition concern, with the potential for local remedies. The Group has offered to dispose of the 13 sites in question and the CMA has indicated that it considers that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the undertakings offered, or a modified version of them, might be accepted by the CMA under the Enterprise Act 2002. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The Group considers its trade and other receivables in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a trade or other receivable to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A trade or other receivable is written off to the Income Statement when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows. The non-current intercompany receivable balance of £1,722.0m is largely due to the intercompany receivables arising out of the sale-and-leaseback transaction, as properties owned by the Group were sold to a fellow wholly-owned subsidiary of the ultimate parent undertaking in exchange for an intercompany receivable. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The Group has a risk management programme in place through which it seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of these market risks. In addition, The Group hedges interest and exchange rate exposure on foreign currency debt obligations. The Group does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. _Interest rate risk_ The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate liabilities (based on SONIA and EURIBOR) primarily composed of the Senior Facilities, which consist of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A, Term Loan B and Arthur Additional Bridge Facility. The EURIBOR interest rate risk on Facility B is hedged through entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps to fix the interest payments in pound sterling at rates between 3.70% - 3.76%. The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes are set at fixed rates between 3.25% and 4.50%. The Group, after the impact of hedge accounting, is exposed to possible changes in SONIA on its outstanding floating rate loan (Term Loan A and Arthur Additional Bridge Facility). It is anticipated that a 0.5% increase in the SONIA rate would give rise to a decrease in profit before tax of £1.2m (2021: £0.9m). The Group’s Term Loan A, Arthur Additional Bridge Facility and Revolving Credit Facilities have been impacted by the interest rate benchmark reform. The Group has transitioned these agreements to the new UK risk-free rate benchmark, SONIA, which was applied to the Group’s interest period starting 1 April 2022. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

At 31 December 2022, the Group held £24.0m (2021: £14.1m) in-the-money assets, and £17.3m (2021: £1.4m) out-of-the-money liabilities in respect of its forward contracts. During the year, the Group recognised net losses on revaluation of hedged monetary assets and liabilities from historical cost to period-end spot rate of £2.7m (2021: £0.3m gains). The fair values of the Group's financial derivatives have been calculated at the observable unquoted interest rates and are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. _Cross-currency interest rate swaps_ These derivatives are measured at fair value using a swap valuation model. The model incorporates various observable market inputs (Level 2) including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies and interest rate curves. The model incorporates a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative counter-party default risk. These derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of cross-currency interest rate swaps entered into and are split between in-the-money (assets) and out-of-the-money (liabilities). At 31 December 2022, the Group held £36.0m (2021: £nil) in-the-money assets, and £nil (2021: £22.7m) out-of-the-money liabilities in respect of its cross-currency interest rate swaps. _Investments- fair value through profit and loss_ The fair value of the investment in Arthur Foodstores Limited on initial recognition was considered to be the purchase price. Prior to acquiring the investment in Arthur Foodstores Limited the Directors performed a valuation exercise using a “market” (or “income”) approach. As the acquisition occurred in close proximity to the year end and the Directors are not aware of any material changes to the underlying business, they are satisfied that the price paid equates to fair value at the year end. The key assumptions used in the valuation performed are the underlying EBITDA generated by Arthur Foodstores Limited in the preceding 12 months, combined with expected ongoing synergy benefits generated by the Group as a result of this investment; and a multiple applied to this combined amount. If either of these were to be sensitised by 5% this would change the valuation by £23.1m. £461.8m is both the carrying value and fair value of the investment at 31 December 2022. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) _Foreign currency risk Forward currency hedging contracts_ The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are managed using forward contracts. The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31 December 2022, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases. The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a period of more than 12 months after 31 December 2022. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2022, a net unrealised gain of £36.2m (2021: £43.7m gain) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of hedging contracts. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of these hedging contracts was £7.5m (2021: £43.7m gain). This consists of a £14.4m (2021: £11.6m) gain on not-yet-matured contracts during the year, £23.4m of gains reclassified to the Income Statement during the year (2021: £42.3m losses) and a £1.5m taxation credit (2021: £10.2m charge). Under the Group’s hedging policy, forward currency contracts can be used for both goods for resale and goods not for resale. The only items for which forward currency contracts are in place as at 31 December 2022 are forecast purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 100% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the Income Statement at the point of sale. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash flows would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the year, therefore, amounts recognised in the Income Statement in relation to ineffective forward contract hedges is £nil (2021: £nil). At 31 December 2022, the Group held £749.5m (2021: £699.9m) of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts, designated as cash flow hedges. These forward contracts are largely in relation to purchases of US Dollars (notional $908.4m) and Euros (notional €7.1m) with varying maturities up to December 2023. For the above currencies the rates ranged from USD/GBP from 1.098 to 1.369 (2021: 1.315 to 1.420) and Euro/GBP 1.132 to 1.157 (2021: 1.165 to 1.189). As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure using forward currency contracts, changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short-term profitability or cash flow. It is anticipated that a 5% movement in the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of £34.6m (2021: £33.5m). _Cross-currency swap_ The Group has entered into a floating rate Euro denominated Term Loan B. The non-GBP interest and principal repayment cash flows from the Euro debt agreement expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that impact profit or loss on a consolidated basis. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) Under the Group’s hedging policy, the Group hedges both the foreign exchange and interest rate risk associated with a portion of the Group’s existing, Euro foreign-currency denominated debt using EUR-GBP cross currency interest rate swap contracts to effectively eliminate variability in the Group’s functional currency equivalent cash flows due to variability in the EUR-GBP exchange rate and the variable interest rate. The hedge ratio is 100% on a current notional basis. The Group has excluded from the cross-currency interest rate swap both the time value and currency basis elements of the cross-currency interest rate swap. Ineffectiveness could arise from movements in counterparty credit spread, the non-zero fair value at the hedge designation date due to market changes that have occurred since the instrument’s inception and changes to critical terms (e.g. reset dates, index mismatches, payment dates). To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the change in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. The amounts recognised in the Income Statement for the period ended 31 December 2022 relating to ineffectiveness and excluded items was less than £0.1m. At 31 December 2022, the Group holds cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) with a total nominal value of €844.5m, designated as cash flow hedges. These swaps result in a fixed GBP interest rate ranging from 3.70% to 3.76% and EUR/GBP rate of 1.1412. The CCIRSs were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2022, a net unrealised gain of £21.2m (2021: £6.6m) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net gain recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of these swaps was £14.5m (2021: £7.3m). This consists of a £35.5m gain reclassified to the Income Statement during the year (2021: £34.5m loss) and a net loss debited to the cost of hedging reserve of £0.1m (2021: £0.7m net gain), offset by a £54.9m gain (2021: £25.5m loss) on the fair value of the swaps at period end and a taxation charge of £4.8m (2021: £2.4m). The value of the CCIRSs are sensitive to movements in EURIBOR and EUR/GBP exchange rates. A 0.5% change in EURIBOR results in a £2.9m (2021: £6.5m) change in value of the CCIRSs and a 5% change in the EUR/GBP exchange rates results in a £38.9m (2021: £38.1m) change in the value of the CCIRSs. The amounts charged to the income statement are not sensitive to a change in interest rates but a 5% increase in the FX rate increases the amount of ineffectiveness by £nil (2021: £0.4m). ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued) _Credit risk_ The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is included in their carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date. See note 16 for further information on trade receivables and intercompany receivables and details of recoverability. The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default in relation to trade receivables including detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted. Surplus cash is placed in both short-term deposits and money market funds with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Group Treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit in keeping with internal objectives. This includes monitoring the credit rating of counterparties and investing in accordance with our internal policy. Counterparty credit limits are reviewed on a monthly basis, and may be updated throughout the financial year. The limits are set to minimise the concentration of risk and are set taking into account the type of financial asset and the credit rating of the financial institution. Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses model under IFRS 9 and no impairment is required. _Liquidity risk_ The Group’s Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash flows. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility using operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At 31 December 2022, the RCF and overdraft facilities are unutilised. At 31 December 2022, the Group held cash of £662.5m (2021: £505.5m) to secure short-term flexibility.

A further loan balance with a carrying value of £2.8m owed by the Group to Arthur in relation to other matters is outstanding at 31 December 2022. Following the recognition of the liabilities under the debt agreements disclosed above, the Group also capitalised transaction costs which were directly attributable to the issue of the borrowings.

In order to enable the AGPS to execute the buy-in, ASDA Stores made a contribution in 2019 to the AGPS of £707.5m (“the buy-in contribution”) and advanced a loan to the Scheme with an original book value of £467.3m (""the buy-in loan""). Interest is charged at an arms-length rate on this loan. To the extent that the AGPS is unable to settle the buy-in loan balance in full out of the proceeds realised through the liquidation of assets retained by the Scheme after buy-in, ASDA Stores is contractually obliged under a back-to-back agreement (“the BTB Agreement”) to make a contribution to the Scheme to the value of the shortfall between the assets in the Scheme and the outstanding balance on the buy-in loan, the proceeds of which can be used by the Scheme to settle outstanding amounts on the buy-in loan. At the point of the buy-in, the Scheme retained ownership of various assets, including illiquid investments and cash, some of which will be required to meet ongoing expenses incurred by the Scheme and the remainder of which the Scheme has used and will continue to use to repay principal and interest on the buy-in loan. On 9 July 2021, the Trustees of AGPS completed a full buy-out of the Scheme with Rothesay. Other than estimated pension liabilities of £0.5m (“the retained liabilities”) for which ASDA Stores remains sponsoring employer, together with Scheme assets to that value which will be used to settle the retained liabilities, the buy-out extinguished ASDA Stores’ responsibility for funding the AGPS as sponsoring employer and as such, all other assets and liabilities of the AGPS were de-recognised from the Group consolidated balance sheet during the prior period. See further detail below for amounts recognised in the consolidated Statement of Other Comprehensive Income and the consolidated Income Statement in respect of this. _Amounts recognised in Other Comprehensive Income - prior period_ Prior to the buy-out on 9 July 2021, as the remaining assets of the AGPS were held within the Scheme as a separate legal entity from the Group and could be used to settle pension liabilities in the event of a shortfall from the BPA, they met the definition of pension assets under IAS 19 - Employee Benefits. As such, changes in the fair value of Scheme assets and liabilities in the period prior to 9 July 2021 were accounted for as actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income with a total net actuarial loss recognised of £13.9m, including an amount of £15.1m in respect of deferred consideration for the BPA arising out of the buy-in transaction. Further to the above, an actuarial gain of £0.7m was recognised in respect of actuarial movements relating to the liabilities of the UURBS. Total pre-tax net losses recognised in other comprehensive income during the prior period were £13.2m. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

At the point of buy-out, the Directors estimated the amount outstanding on the buy-in loan which the Scheme will be able to settle without recourse to the BTB to be £11.5m and as such, this amount was reclassified to other receivables at the point of buy-out. The difference between the net carrying amount of Scheme assets and liabilities and the recoverable amount of the buy-in loan at the date of buyout - after accounting for the net actuarial loss of £13.9m described above - was £8.7m. This amount was recognised as a settlement loss within operating expenses in the prior period. _Amounts recognised in the consolidated Income Statement - current year_ Interest expense of £0.3m has been recognised during the year in relation to the unwind of discount on the liabilities of the UURBS. _Amounts recognised in Other Comprehensive Income - current year_ Pre-tax net gains of £5.5m have been recognised during the year in relation to actuarial movements on the liabilities of the UURBS. No actuarial gains or losses on the retained assets and liabilities of the AGPS have arisen during the year. _Classification of AGPS pension cashflows_ During the year, the AGPS has made repayments of principal on the buy-in loan of nil (2021: £38.5m) and interest payments of £0.7m (2021: £0.5m).

Furthermore, options granted prior to the Acquisition date to participants in the Sharesave scheme were exercised in the six-month period following completion of the Acquisition. As a result, all share-based payment liabilities of the Group were extinguished during the prior period. The carrying value of share-based payment liabilities relating to these schemes at 31 December 2022 is £nil (2021: £nil). Details of changes in the share-based payments liabilities relating to the pre-Acquisition schemes are provided in the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the period ended 31 December 2021 which are available from the registered office of the Group - Waterside Head Office, Haslingden Road, Guide, Blackburn, Lancashire, United Kingdom, BB1 2FA. _Management Incentive Plan- current year_ During the year, management shares in the immediate parent company of the Group were issued to eligible members of senior management employed by the Group as part of a Management Incentive Plan (“MIP”) in exchange for proceeds determined by an independently determined fair value calculated at the issue date. Under the MIP, an intermediate holding company of the Group - Bellis Midco 2 Limited - has entered into an agreement with the holders of MIP management shares (“MIP scheme members”) whereby MIP scheme members are granted put options which, when exercised, enable them to sell their management shares to Bellis Midco 2 Limited or another non-Group entity for a value which is based on an independent valuation determined at the exercise date. MIP scheme members are required to be employed by the Group at the grant date of the MIP shares. If a member of the scheme ceases to be employed by the Group during the vesting period, Bellis Midco 2 Limited, a parent of Bellis Finco PLC, has the option to repurchase, or nominate another entity of the Group to repurchase, the shares during the 12 month period after the member’s leave date. As such, the Directors have determined that the MIP scheme falls within the scope of IFRS 2. The difference between the IFRS 2 fair value and the fair value paid by MIP scheme members at the grant date is expensed over the vesting period (i.e. the period from date on which the MIP shares are granted to the estimated exercise date) as an expense in the consolidated Income Statement. As neither MIP shares nor put options over MIP shares are issued by entities within the Group, and as there is no recharge agreement in place which requires any entity within the Group to settle liabilities in respect of MIP shares, changes in the fair value of MIP shares are accounted for on an equity-settled basis. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Insurance liabilities are not discounted as the impact would not be material. The dilapidation provision represents provisions for the cost of works required to remove leasehold improvements within leasehold properties at the end of their lease term. The amount provided during the year is accounted for as an increase or decrease in the cost of property, plant and equipment and the impact of this will be recognised as depreciation over the lease terms of the sites to which the provision relates.

The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the distribution centres and those higher wage rates and more favourable terms and conditions on a prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be served. At present, the Directors cannot predict the number of claims that may be served, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. On 26 March 2021, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, that the work of hourly-paid workers in distribution centres and the work of hourly-paid workers in stores can be compared. Despite this ruling, the Directors believe that there are substantial factual and legal defences to these claims, and intend to defend the claims vigorously. No provision continues to be recognised on the basis that any potential liability is only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. As a result of the change of ownership on 16 February 2021, the Group have entered into an indemnification agreement which is guaranteed by the former ultimate parent of ASDA Stores Limited, Walmart Inc. (""Walmart"") with respect to these claims. Walmart has indemnified the Group for these claims up to a contractually agreed amount. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2022 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2022 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Our evaluation of the directors’ assessment of the group and parent company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included the following procedures: - We obtained management’s Going Concern assessment including the cash forecast and forecast covenant calculation which covers the period to 31 December 2023. The Group has modelled a base scenario and a severe but plausible downside scenario in their cash forecasts in order to incorporate unexpected changes to the forecasted liquidity of the Group; - We tested the assumptions included in each modelled scenario for the cash forecast and covenant calculation and we have considered the impact of the current geopolitical situation as well as climate change cash commitments on the going concern assessment performed by the Directors; - We challenged the appropriateness of the methods used to calculate the cash forecasts and covenant calculations and determined that they were appropriately sophisticated to be able to make an assessment on going concern; - We have performed procedures over the integrity of the modelling, challenged the cash flows included against external benchmarks and market consensus and the availability of funding included in the assessment; - We considered the mitigating factors included in the cash forecasts and covenant calculations that are within control of the Group and to assess whether that they provide potential further liquidity if required. We also agreed the credit facilities back to source contracts to validate the credit facilities available to the Group; and, - We have performed reverse stress testing in order to identify what factors would lead to the Group utilising all liquidity or breaching the financial covenant during the going concern period.

We note that, other than an amount of £9.8m in respect of Term Loan A which is due in February 2023, no further principal repayments of the borrowings are due during the going concern period. There is significant liquidity through the cash balance and the Revolving Credit Facility (RCF) available to the Group to meet its obligations as they fall due. We observe that in management’s base case and downside scenarios, there is significant headroom without taking the benefit of any identified mitigations. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the period to 31 December 2023. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the group and parent company’s ability to continue as a going concern. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

The Group has considered the most significant future impacts from climate change on their operations and disclosed these as part of their principal risks and uncertainties on page 21, which form part of the “Other information,” rather than the audited financial statements. Our procedures on these disclosures therefore consisted solely of considering whether they are materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit or otherwise appear to be materially misstated. As explained in the Basis of Preparation section of Note 1, governmental and societal responses to climate change risks are still developing, and are interdependent upon each other, and consequently financial statements cannot capture all possible future outcomes as these are not yet known. Our audit effort in considering climate change was focused on ensuring that the effects of material climate risks disclosed have been appropriately considered in the financial statements.

Acquisition accounting requires management judgement in identifying and valuing the assets acquired, determining at what point control was achieved and identifying appropriate fair value adjustments as part of the purchase price exercise. Acquisition accounting involves a high degree of judgement and estimation. There is a risk that the assets acquired such as the land, buildings, and intangible assets and corresponding goodwill recognised are not valued appropriately. _Our response to the risk_ We performed full scope audit procedures over the risk area which covered all the risk amount. We performed the following procedures: - We performed a walk through to understand the process management had taken in regards to acquisition accounting and purchase price allocation; - We read the sale and purchase agreements to understand the terms of acquisition, including any indemnities and how these had been accounted for; - We evaluated management’s judgement that control existed at legal completion as opposed to when the Initial Enforcement Order ceased. We considered the nature of the IEO, any relief granted during the phase and whether there was any contrary evidence to determine whether control had not passed as of 16 February 2021; - We tested the completeness of the assets and liabilities acquired and fair valued as part of the PPA exercise; - We validated the consideration paid for ASDA Group Limited, from the sales purchase agreement through to bank statements. We also assessed any pass-through costs (such as share options, pension related costs) and ensured they had been accounted for appropriately; - We involved our Valuations specialists to assess and challenge the purchase price allocation (PPA) reports prepared by management or management’s specialists; - We challenged management’s cashflow forecast and assumptions including, for example, discount rates, revenue and EBIT growth, and other key inputs to support the valuation of the intangible assets identified; - We audited other material fair value adjustments outside of the recognition of intangible assets, including involving property specialists to assess the fair value of the tangible and property assets; and, - We evaluated any other significant transactions identified from our review of board minutes, to determine if they had been treated correctly within the PPA. We reviewed Board and other papers in connection with the acquisition to support the identification of intangible assets acquired. _Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee_ Based on our audit procedures we have concluded that the acquisition accounting undertaken was performed in accordance with IFRS 3 and not materially misstated. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.451,Sale and Leaseback,215.451.1,,"Refer to the Accounting policies (Note 1); and Note 9 of the Consolidated Financial Statements. _Risk_ During the period management entered into a sale and leaseback agreement to sell the depot assets owned by ASDA Group Limited to Bellis Select Warehouse Limited and then subsequently to Blackstone. As a result of this transaction a gain of £279.1m was recognised in the income statement of Bellis Finco PLC. This gain is based on the assets being at fair value and market rents with appropriate yields. Judgement is required in assessing whether the transaction was at market terms and as such represents the fair values of the assets. In addition, due to the material nature of the sale and leaseback gain, the incremental borrowing rate (IBR) used by management was also a focus area given IBR is inherently judgmental and complex, especially given the longevity of the lease tenor and the extent of available market data at this tenor. There is also judgement around the assets identified as being landlord vs tenant assets, to ensure they are appropriately de-recognised from the balance sheet as a result of the sale and thus the fair value gain is correctly calculated, and subsequent lease accounting is applied appropriately. _Our response to the risk_ We performed full scope audit procedures over the risk area which covered all the risk amount. We performed the following procedures: - We walked through the process undertaken by the Directors and management in executing the sale and leaseback transaction; - We read all key agreements to ensure that the transaction met the criteria to be recognised as a sale under IFRS 15; - We used our property valuation specialists to assess both the fair value and market rents of the properties; - We obtained extracts from the fixed assets register and validated that the assets sold were correctly identified as landlord assets and therefore appropriately de-recognised; - We recomputed the gain and other related balance sheet amounts to validate the accuracy of the numbers reported; and, - We utilised our treasury specialists to support in challenging the IBR determined by management to ensure the methodology and value applied was in line with the standard. _Key observations communicated to the Audit Committee_ We concluded that the criteria to recognise the transaction as a sale had been met under IFRS 15. We concluded that the amounts recorded in relation to the sale and leaseback were materially stated. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
1162_2,Preliminary Offerings 2024.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.453,Our application of materiality,215.453.1,,"We apply the concept of materiality in planning and performing the audit, in evaluating the effect of identified misstatements on the audit and in forming our audit opinion. _Materiality_ The magnitude of an omission or misstatement that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of the users of the financial statements. Materiality provides a basis for determining the nature and extent of our audit procedures. We determined materiality for the Group to be £34 million, which is 5% of adjusted EBIT. We believe that adjusted EBIT provides us with an appropriate basis for materiality and is the most relevant measure for stakeholders as profitability is a key measure. EBIT has been adjusted to remove the one-off gain from the sale and leaseback of £279.1m, the gain on bargain purchase of £2,654.3m (both disclosed as Other Income), one-off acquisition related expenses of £92.6m and £116.7m relating to additional depreciation as a result of fair value uplifts on PPE, intangible assets and leases. We have adjusted for these items as we consider them non-recurring in nature. We determined materiality for the Parent Company to be £27 million, which is 2% of equity. During the course of our audit, we reassessed initial materiality and determined that no change from our original assessment at planning was required. _Performance materiality_ The application of materiality at the individual account or balance level. It is set at an amount to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds materiality. On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement was that performance materiality was 75% of our planning materiality, namely £25m. We have set performance materiality at this percentage due to there being no factors present that indicate a higher likelihood that misstatements may occur within the financial statements based on our history of auditing the trading group, ASDA Group Limited. Audit work at component locations for the purpose of obtaining audit coverage over significant financial statement accounts is undertaken based on a percentage of total performance materiality. The performance materiality set for each component is based on the relative scale and risk of the component to the Group as a whole and our assessment of the risk of misstatement at that component. In the current period, the range of performance materiality allocated to components was £5m to £25m. _Reporting threshold_ An amount below which identified misstatements are considered as being clearly trivial. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them all uncorrected audit differences in excess of £2m, which is set at 8% of planning materiality, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We evaluate any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations in forming our opinion. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of Bellis Finco PLC (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect irregularities, including fraud. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is detailed below. However, the primary responsibility for the prevention and detection of fraud rests with both those charged with governance of the entity and management. Our approach was as follows: - We obtained an understanding of the legal and regulatory frameworks that are applicable to the Group and determined that the most significant frameworks directly relevant to specific assertions in the financial statements are those that relate to the reporting framework (International Accounting Standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 for the group and United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice for the parent) and the relevant tax laws and regulations in the UK. In addition, we concluded that there are certain significant laws and regulations which may have an effect on the determination of the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements being those laws and regulations relating to health and safety and employee matters. - We understood how Bellis Finco PLC is complying with those frameworks by making enquiries of Group management, Group Legal & Compliance, and Internal Audit. We corroborated our enquiries through our review of board minutes and papers and inspection of commentary in the group management accounts. - We assessed the susceptibility of the Group’s financial statements to material misstatement, including how fraud might occur by meeting with management from various parts of the business to understand where it considered there was a susceptibility to fraud. We also considered performance targets and their propensity to influence efforts made by management to manage earnings. We considered the programmes and controls that the Group has established to address risks identified, or that otherwise prevent, deter and detect fraud; and how senior management monitors those programmes and controls. Where the risk was considered to be higher, we performed audit procedures to address each identified fraud risk. These procedures included testing manual journals and were designed to provide reasonable assurance that the financial statements were free from material fraud and error. - Based on this understanding we designed our audit procedures to identify non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Our procedures involved journal entry testing on the full population of journals, with a focus on manual consolidation journals, and journals indicating large or unusual transactions based on our understanding of the business; enquiries of Group management, Group Legal, Group Ethics & Compliance, and Internal Audit. In addition, we completed procedures to conclude on the compliance of the disclosures in the Group Financial Statements with the requirements of the relevant accounting standards, and UK legislation. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at https://www frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities.

The remaining gain of £564.6m is deferred as a reduction to the right-of-use asset relating to the leaseback. On 13 July, 22 July and 21 October 2021, the distribution properties that were transferred to Bellis Select Warehouse Limited were sold for £1,675.0m to third party entities controlled by Blackstone Group Inc. These properties were leased back to the Group on terms ranging from 18 months to 35 years (including the assumption that leases will be extended by 10 years, consistent with the assumptions set out in note 1). The Group continues to lease these properties from entities controlled by Blackstone Group Inc. and has adjusted the right of use assets and lease liabilities to reflect amended terms of the leases on transfer to the third-party entities at that date. The leasebacks of the depots, taking into account the deferral of a proportion of the disposal gain into the right-of-use asset and subsequent modification to the lease term, resulted in an increase in right-of-use assets of £624.9m and lease liabilities of £1,177.4m. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

Part of the security pledged is in relation to one of the Group’s existing supply chain finance agreements in the form of fixed and floating charges over certain of the Group’s assets. There were no other changes to the terms of this supply chain finance agreement which impact on the nature of amounts owed to the bank under this arrangement. Given consideration of this and the other factors set out in note 1, the Directors have concluded that the substance of the Group’s liabilities under this supply chain financing agreement remain consistent overall with that of a trade payable and accordingly will continue to be accounted for and classified as trade payables.

The Group has a risk management programme in place through which it seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of these market risks. In addition, The Group hedges interest and exchange rate exposure on foreign currency debt obligations. The Group does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. _Interest rate risk_ The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on its floating rate liabilities (based on LIBOR and EURIBOR) primarily composed of the Senior Facilities, which consist of the Revolving Credit Facility, Term Loan A and Term Loan B. The EURIBOR interest rate risk on Facility B is hedged through entering into cross-currency interest rate swaps to fix the interest payments in pound sterling at rates between 3.70% - 3.76%. The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Unsecured Notes are set at fixed rates between 3.25% and 4.50%. The Group, after the impact of hedge accounting, is exposed to possible changes in LIBOR on its outstanding floating rate loan (Term Loan A). It is anticipated that a 0.5% increase in the LIBOR rate would give rise to a decrease in profit before tax of £0.9m for the period ended 31 December 2021. The Group’s Term Loan A and Revolving Credit Facilities are impacted by the interest rate benchmark reform. The Group has transitioned these agreements to the new UK risk-free rate benchmark, SONIA, which will be applied to the Group’s next interest period starting 1 April 2022. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

At 31 December 2021, the Group held £14.1m in-the-money assets, and £24.1m out-of-the-money liabilities in respect of its forward contracts. During the period, the Group recognised net gains on revaluation of hedged monetary assets and liabilities from historical cost to period-end spot rate of £0.3m. The fair values of the Group's financial derivatives have been calculated at the observable unquoted interest rates and are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. _Cross-currency interest rate swaps_ These derivatives are measured at fair value using a swap valuation model. The model incorporates various observable market inputs (Level 2) including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates, yield curves of the respective currencies, currency basis spreads between the respective currencies and interest rate curves. The model incorporates a credit valuation adjustment attributable to derivative counter-party default risk. _Foreign currency risk Forward currency hedging contracts_ The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are managed using forward contracts. The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31 December 2021, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases. The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a period of more than 12 months after 31 December 2021. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2021, a net unrealised gain of £43.7m was included in the hedge reserve in respect of hedging contracts. The net gain recognised in other comprehensive income during the period in respect of these hedging contracts was £43.7m. This consists of a £11.6m gain on not-yet-matured contracts during the period, £42.3m of losses reclassified to the Income Statement during the period and a £10.2m taxation charge. Under the Group’s hedging policy, the only items for which forward currency contracts are in place are forecast purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 95% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the Income Statement at the point of sale. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash flows would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the period, therefore, amounts recognised in the Income Statement in relation to ineffective forward contract hedges is £nil. At 31 December 2021, the Group held £699.9m of outstanding forward foreign currency contracts, designated as cash flow hedges. These forward contracts are largely in relation to purchases of US Dollars (notional $944.4m) and Euros (notional €15.9m) with varying maturities up to December 2022. For the above currencies the rates ranged from USD/GBP from 1.315 to 1.420 and Euro/GBP 1.165 to 1.189. As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure using forward currency contracts, changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short-term profitability or cash flow. It is anticipated that a 5% movement in the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management’s assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of £33.5m _Cross-currency swap_ The Group has entered into a floating rate Euro denominated Term Loan B. The non-GBP interest and principal repayment cash flows from the Euro debt agreement expose the Company to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates that impact profit or loss on a consolidated basis. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued) Under the Group’s hedging policy, the Group hedges both the foreign exchange and interest rate risk associated with a portion of the Group’s existing, Euro foreign-currency denominated debt using EUR-GBP cross currency interest rate swap contracts to effectively eliminate variability in the Group’s functional currency equivalent cash flows due to variability in the EUR-GBP exchange rate and the variable interest rate. The hedge ratio is 100% on a current notional basis. The Group has excluded from the cross-currency interest rate swap both the time value and currency basis elements of the cross-currency interest rate swap. Ineffectiveness could arise from movements in counterparty credit spread, the non-zero fair value at the hedge designation date due to market changes that have occurred since the instrument’s inception and changes to critical terms (e.g. reset dates, index mismatches, payment dates). To test the hedge effectiveness, the Group uses the hypothetical derivative method and compares the changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments against the change in fair value of the hedged items attributable to the hedged risks. The amounts recognised in the Income Statement for the period ended 31 December 2021 relating to ineffectiveness and excluded items was less than £0.1m. At 31 December 2021, the Group holds cross-currency interest rate swaps (CCIRS) with a total nominal value of €844.5m, designated as cash flow hedges. These swaps result in a fixed GBP interest rate ranging from 3.70% to 3.76% and EUR/GBP rate of 1.1412. The CCIRSs were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2021, a net unrealised gain of £6.6m was included in the hedge reserve in respect of these swaps. The net gain recognised in other comprehensive income during the period in respect of these swaps was £7.3m. This consists of a £34.5m loss reclassified to the Income Statement during the period and a net gain credited to the cost of hedging reserve of £0.7m, partially offset by a £25.5m loss on the fair value of the swaps at period end and a taxation charge of £2.4m. The value of the CCIRSs are sensitive to movements in EURIBOR and EUR/GBP exchange rates. A 0.5% change in EURIBOR results in a £6.5m change in value of the CCIRSs and a 5% change in the EUR/GBP exchange rates results in a £38.1m change in the value of the CCIRSs. The amounts charged to the income statement are not sensitive to a change in interest rates but a 5% increase in the FX rate increases the amount of ineffectiveness by £0.4m. _Credit risk_ The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is included in their carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date. See note 15 for further information on trade receivables and intercompany receivables and details of recoverability. The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default in relation to trade receivables including detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted. Surplus cash is placed on short-term deposit with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Group Treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit. Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses model under IFRS 9 and no impairment is required. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued) _Liquidity risk_ The Group’s Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash flows.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: _External borrowings_ For listed and traded instruments (i.e. Senior Secured Notes, Senior Unsecured Notes and Euro Term Loan B) over-the-counter prices are used to determine the fair value (Level 2). For unlisted instruments the fair value is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using prevailing interest rates to net present value (Level 2). _Intercompany payables and receivables_ The fair value of fixed rate intercompany payables and receivables is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash flow using prevailing interest rates to net present value.

In order to enable the AGPS to execute the buy-in, ASDA Stores made a contribution in 2019 to the AGPS of £707.5m (“the buy-in contribution”) and advanced a loan to the Scheme with an original book value of £467.3m (""the buy-in loan""). Interest is charged at an arms-length rate on this loan. To the extent that the AGPS is unable to settle the buy-in loan balance in full out of the proceeds realised through the liquidation of assets retained by the Scheme after buy-in, ASDA Stores is contractually obliged under a back-to-back agreement (“the BTB Agreement”) to make a contribution to the Scheme to the value of the shortfall between the assets in the Scheme and the outstanding balance on the buy-in loan, the proceeds of which can be used by the Scheme to settle outstanding amounts on the buy-in loan. At the point of the buy-in, the Scheme retained ownership of various assets, including illiquid investments and cash, some of which will be required to meet ongoing expenses incurred by the Scheme and the remainder of which the Scheme has used and will continue to use to repay principal and interest on the buy-in loan. On 9 July 2021, the Trustees of AGPS completed a full buy-out of the Scheme with Rothesay. Other than estimated pension liabilities of £0.5m (“the retained liabilities”) for which ASDA Stores remains sponsoring employer, together with Scheme assets to that value which will be used to settle the retained liabilities, the buy-out has extinguished the ASDA Stores’ responsibility for funding the AGPS as sponsoring employer and as such, all other assets and liabilities of the AGPS have been de-recognised from the Group consolidated balance sheet during the period. See further detail below for amounts recognised in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income and the Income Statement in respect of this. _Amounts recognised in Other Comprehensive Income_ Prior to the buy-out on 9 July 2021, as the remaining illiquid assets and cash of the AGPS were held within the Scheme as a separate legal entity from the Group and could be used to settle pension liabilities in the event of a shortfall from the BPA, they met the definition of pension assets under IAS 19 - Employee Benefits. As such, changes in the fair value of Scheme assets and liabilities in the period prior to 9 July 2021 have been accounted for as actuarial gains and losses in other comprehensive income with a total net actuarial gain recognised of £1.2m. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796

This amount was variable dependant on the findings of due diligence and other factors including the timing of payments by Rothesay to the Scheme in respect of pension payments and the amount of £15.1m was finalised during the period. As the amount paid relates to deferred consideration for the BPA, this amount has been recognised as a loss in other comprehensive income in line with the treatment of the buy-in loss recorded in the financial statements of ASDA Stores in 2019. As such, the total net loss recognised during the period in other comprehensive income in respect of AGPS assets and liabilities is £13.9m. Further to the above, an actuarial gain of £0.7m has been recognised in respect of actuarial movement relating to the liability of the UURBS. Total pre-tax net losses recognised in OCI are £13.2m. _Settlement loss recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement_ As described above, to the extent that the AGPS is unable to make repayments of principal amounts outstanding on the buy-in loan out of Scheme assets, ASDA Stores is obliged under the BTB Agreement to make a contribution to the AGPS to the value of the shortfall. At the point of buy-out, the Directors have estimated the amount outstanding on the buy-in loan which the Scheme will be able to settle without recourse to the BTB to be £11.5m and as such, this amount has been reclassified to other receivables at the point of buy-out. The difference between the net carrying amount of Scheme assets and liabilities and the recoverable amount of the buy-in loan at the date of buyout - after accounting for the net actuarial loss of £13.9m described above - was £8.7m. This amount has been recognised as a settlement loss within operating expenses. Classification of AGPS pension cashflows During the period, prior to the buy-out, the AGPS made repayments of principal on the buy-in loan of £38.5m and interest payments of £0.5m. These are presented as investing inflows on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. UURBS liabilities ASDA Stores and the Group remain liable for pension benefits payable to members of the UURBS and these liabilities with a fair value at 31 December 2021 of £13.4m are accounted for in line with IAS 19.

Employees with six months’ service were invited to join the scheme annually. Options were granted annually to employees who elected to join, and were exercisable in three or five years from date of grant, depending on the year of grant. The options under this scheme were treated as cash-settled. The exercise price of the options granted was equal to the market price of the shares less 20% on the date of grant. As a condition of the SPA between AHUKL and BAC3, employees exercised all of their sharesave options for the proportion of the vesting period elapsed at the date of exercise.

The value of the provision is established using independent actuarial assessments or a reasonable estimate based on past experience. These provisions are expected to crystallise within 5 years. Insurance liabilities are not discounted as the impact would not be material. The dilapidation provision represents provisions for the cost of works required to remove leasehold improvements within leasehold properties at the end of their lease term. The amount provided during the period is accounted for within additions as an increase in the cost of property, plant and equipment and the impact of this will be recognised as additional depreciation over the lease terms of the sites to which the provision relates. A discount rate of 1.1% has been used in determining this provision.

The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the distribution centres and those higher wage rates and more favourable terms and conditions on a prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be served. At present, the Directors cannot predict the number of claims that may be served, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. On 26 March 2021, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal’s decision, that the work of hourly-paid workers in distribution centres and the work of hourly-paid workers in stores can be compared. Despite this ruling, the Directors believe that there are substantial factual and legal defences to these claims, and intend to defend the claims vigorously. No provision continues to be recognised on the basis that any potential liability is only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits. As a result of the change of ownership on 16 February 2021, the Group have entered into an indemnification agreement which is guaranteed by the former ultimate parent of ASDA Stores Limited, Walmart Inc. (""Walmart"") with respect to these claims. Walmart has indemnified the Group for these claims up to a contractually agreed amount. ----- Bellis Finco PLC Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2021 #### Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Period from 3 September 2020 to 31 December 2021 (continued)",N/A,as_expected,2024,796
