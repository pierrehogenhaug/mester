**EU MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, "EU
**MiFID II"); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients**
are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "distributor")
should take into consideration the manufacturers' target market assessment; however, a distributor subject
to EU MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by
either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook ("COBS"), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA ("UK MiFIR"); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers' target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook (the "UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules") is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers'
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**EU PRIIPs Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor


-----

means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID
II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the "Insurance Distribution Directive"),
where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of EU
MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the "EU
**PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors**
in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPS Regulation.

**UK PRIIPs Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors**

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered,
sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes, a retail
investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of
Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; (ii) a customer within
the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement
the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client, as
defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA. Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as
it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the "UK PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the
Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and,
therefore, offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

References to Regulations or Directives include, in relation to the United Kingdom, those Regulations
or Directives as they form part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA or have been implemented in UK
domestic law, as appropriate.

The Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of Notes in any Member State
of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the EU Prospectus Regulation for the requirement
to publish a prospectus for offers of Notes. The Preliminary Offering Memorandum is not a prospectus for
the purposes of the EU Prospectus Regulation.

This Offering Memorandum has been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Notes in the United

**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION, DATED FEBRUARY 8, 2021** **NOT FOR GENERAL CIRCULATION IN THE UNITED STATES**
**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL**

**Bellis Acquisition Company plc**
**£2,250,000,000       %Senior Secured Notes due 2026**
**Bellis Finco plc**
**£500,000,000       % Senior Notes due 2027**
Bellis Acquisition Company plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the "Senior Secured Notes Issuer"), is offering £2,250.0 million of pound-sterling denominated
% senior secured notes due 2026 (the "Senior Secured Notes"). Bellis Finco plc, a public limited company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales (the "Senior Notes Issuer" and, together with
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the "Issuers"), is offering £500.0 million of pound-sterling denominated      % senior notes due 2027 (the "Senior Notes," and, together with the Senior Secured Notes, the
"Notes"). The Issuers are entities indirectly beneficially-owned principally by funds advised by TDR Capital and Mohsin Issa CBE and Zuber Vali Issa CBE. The offering of the Notes is referred to herein as the
"Offering" and is being made to provide permanent financing for the Issuers' indirect acquisition of the entire share capital of ASDA Group Limited (the "Acquisition").
We expect to settle the Offering on            (the "Issue Date"), which we anticipate will be after the date of consummation of the Acquisition (the "Acquisition **Completion Date"). If that is the case, we will draw**
committed credit facilities to fund a portion of the consideration payable for the Acquisition on the Acquisition Completion Date and will repay part of those drawings with the proceeds of the Offering on the Issue Date. It is,
however, possible that the Acquisition Completion Date may be delayed until after the Issue Date, including due to the timing of our receipt of the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. In that case, unless the Offering is settled
substantially concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, we will, pending completion of the Acquisition, fund the gross proceeds of the Offering into escrow accounts (such proceeds, the "Escrowed Proceeds"
and such accounts, collectively, the "Escrow Accounts"), which will be held in the name of the relevant Issuer, but controlled by the relevant Escrow Agent (as defined herein), and pledged in favour of the relevant
Trustee (as defined below) on behalf of and for the benefit of the holders of the relevant series of Notes, pursuant to the terms of the escrow agreements (each an "Escrow Agreement" and together, the "Escrow
**Agreements") and the Escrow Account Charges (as defined herein). The release of the Escrowed Proceeds, if any, will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the consummation of the Acquisition in**
accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement (as defined herein). In the event we deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Accounts on the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date has
not occurred or the conditions to the release of such Escrowed Proceeds have not otherwise been satisfied, on or before April 30, 2022 (herein referred to as the "Outside Date") or in certain other circumstances (including
at the discretion of Midco, a holding company of the Issuers, subject to certain conditions), the Notes will be mandatorily redeemable at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus accrued and
unpaid interest from the Issued Date to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined herein), and Additional Amounts, if any. If the Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the completion
of the Acquisition, we will forgo the escrow procedures and will instead retain the proceeds of the Offering to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement on the Acquisition Completion Date.
The Senior Secured Notes will mature on    , 2026. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will pay interest on the Senior Secured Notes semi-annually on each        and     , commencing on  ,
2021. Prior to     , 2023, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to redeem all or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof plus a "make-whole" premium. Prior to     , 2023, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may also redeem, during each 12-month period commencing with the Issue Date, up to 10% of the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes, if any) at a redemption price equal to 103% of the principal amount thereof. In addition, prior to     ,
2023, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem at its option up to 40% of the Senior Secured Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings. At any time on or after   , 2023, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior Secured Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. The Senior Notes will mature on     , 2027. The Senior
Notes Issuer will pay interest on the Senior Notes semi-annually on each       and     , commencing on    , 2021. Prior to     , 2023, the Senior Notes Issuer will be entitled, at its option, to
redeem all or a portion of the Senior Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus a "make-whole" premium. In addition, prior to     , 2023, the Senior Notes Issuer may
redeem at its option up to 40% of the Senior Notes with the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings. At any time on or after     , 2023, the Senior Notes Issuer may redeem all or part of the Senior
Notes at the redemption prices set forth in this Offering Memorandum. Upon certain events defined as constituting a change of control, the Issuers may be required to make an offer to purchase the Notes
at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof. In the event of certain developments affecting taxation, the Issuers may redeem all, but not less than all, of each series of Notes.
On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on
a senior basis by ASDA Group Limited and ASDA Stores Limited (the "Initial ASDA Guarantors") on the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date. Subject to the Agreed Security
Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed within 90 days of the Acquisition Completion Date on a senior basis by McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood House Group Limited
(the "Post-Completion Guarantors" and, together with the Initial ASDA Guarantors, the "ASDA Guarantors").
In the event of an escrow funding of the Offering, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's rights with respect to the relevant Escrow Account into which the gross proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes are
deposited will be pledged, on the Issue Date, in favour of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the holders of Senior Secured Notes. On the later of the Issue Date and the
Acquisition Completion Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by first-priority security interests over (a) the issued share capital of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer (the "Issuer Share Collateral") and each of the Initial ASDA Guarantors, (b) the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan and any other material intra-group receivables owing to the Senior Notes
Issuer by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, (c) the material intercompany receivables owing to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Initial ASDA Guarantors, not including the Post-Completion Disposal
Receivables, (d) the material bank accounts located in England and Wales of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each of the Initial ASDA Guarantors, not including the Designated Bank Accounts, and
(e) a floating charge over all or substantially all of the assets (other than customarily excluded assets) of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each of the Initial ASDA Guarantors, as and when created
(collectively, the "Senior Secured Notes Initial Collateral"). On the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date, the Issuer Share Collateral, the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan and any
other material intra-group receivables owing to the Senior Notes Issuer by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (collectively, the "Shared Security") will also secure the Senior Notes Issuer's obligations under
the Senior Notes on a second-priority basis. Within 90 days of the Acquisition Completion Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by (i) first-priority security
interests over (a) all the issued capital stock of each of the Post-Completion Guarantors, (b) the material intra-group receivables owing to the Post-Completion Guarantors by other members of the Senior
Secured Group (not including the Post-Completion Disposal Receivables), and (c) the material bank accounts located in England and Wales of the Post-Completion Guarantors (not including the Designated
Bank Accounts) and (ii) a floating charge over all or substantially all assets of the Post-Completion Guarantors (other than customarily excluded assets). Within 180 days of the Acquisition Completion Date,
subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be further secured by first-priority interests over each ASDA Guarantor's Material Real Property (collectively, the "Senior Secured
**Notes Post-Completion Collateral," and together with the Senior Secured Notes Initial Collateral, the "Senior Secured Notes Collateral").**
On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be senior obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated
basis by (i) on the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and each of the Initial ASDA Guarantors, and (ii) within 90 days of the Acquisition Completion
Date, the Post-Completion Guarantors (together with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Initial ASDA Guarantors, the "Senior Notes Guarantors").
In the event of an escrow funding of the Offering, the Senior Notes Issuer's rights with respect to the relevant Escrow Account into which the gross proceeds of the Senior Notes are deposited will be
pledged, on the Issue Date, in favour of the Senior Notes Trustee on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the holders of Senior Notes. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Notes will be secured
on the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date by (i) first-priority security interests over (a) all the issued capital stock of the Senior Notes Issuer, (b) the material intra-group receivables
owing by the Senior Notes Issuer to the Jersey Security Provider (as defined herein) and (c) the Senior Notes Issuer's material bank accounts located in England and Wales, and second-priority interests
in the Shared Security (collectively, the "Senior Notes Collateral").
The ASDA Guarantors will also guarantee, and the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (including the Shared Security) will also secure, the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement (including
the Revolving Credit Facilities) and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility on a pari passu and equal and ratable basis with the Senior Secured Notes (and on a senior basis to the Senior Notes). Additionally,
the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (including the Shared Security) may also secure, on an equal and ratable, or in certain circumstances super senior, basis with the Senior Secured Notes (and on a

**List") of The International Stock Exchange (the "Exchange") and to admit the Notes for trading on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that any such listing will be granted or maintained and**
settlement of the Notes is not conditioned upon obtaining this listing or permission.
**_Investing in the Notes involves risks. See "Risk Factors" beginning on page 75._**

**NOTICE TO EEA AND UK INVESTORS**

**EU MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible
counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, "EU
**MiFID II"); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients**
are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the Notes (a "distributor")
should take into consideration the manufacturers' target market assessment; however, a distributor subject
to EU MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by
either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate
distribution channels.

**UK MiFIR product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market**

Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment
in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is only eligible
counterparties, as defined in the FCA Handbook Conduct of Business Sourcebook ("COBS"), and
professional clients, as defined in Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue
of the EUWA ("UK MiFIR"); and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and
professional clients are appropriate. Any distributor should take into consideration the manufacturers' target
market assessment; however, a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product
Governance Sourcebook (the "UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules") is responsible for undertaking its
own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers'
target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

**_European Economic Area_**

**EU PRIIPs Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Investors**

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise
made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available the Notes to any retail investor in the
European Economic Area (the "EEA"). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one
(or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II or (ii) a customer within
the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU (the "Insurance Distribution Directive"), where that customer would
not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II. Consequently no
key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the "EU PRIIPs Regulation") for
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been
prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail
investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation.

vii


-----

**_United Kingdom_**

**UK PRIIPs Regulation/Prohibition of sales to UK Retail Investors**

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or otherwise made
available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail investor in the United
Kingdom. For the purposes of this provision, the expression "retail investor" means a person who is one
(or more) of the following:

a) a retail client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of UK MiFIR; or

b) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations made
under the FSMA to implement Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not
qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014
as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of
domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the "UK PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the Notes or
otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore
offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom
may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.

**Other UK regulatory restrictions**

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed that:

a) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to
be communicated an invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning
of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issue or sale of the Notes in
circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the communication; and

b) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**NOTICE TO JERSEY INVESTORS**

beleggers) as defined in section 1:1 of the AFS. For the purposes of this provision, the expression an
"offer of Notes to the public" in relation to any Notes in the Netherlands means to make a sufficiently

pursuant to article 652a and/or article 1156 of the Swiss Code of Obligations or a listing prospectus
within the meaning of the listing rules of the SIX Swiss Exchange or any other regulated trading facility
in Switzerland, and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering or marketing material
relating to the Notes may be publicly distributed or otherwise made publicly available in Switzerland.

The Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be
offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in Switzerland. For these purposes, a
retail investor means a person who is a retail client as defined in Article 4 of the Swiss Financial Services
Act (the "FinSA"). Consequently, no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No
1286/2014 (or any equivalent document under the FinSA) has been or will be prepared in relation to any
Notes and therefore, any Notes with a derivative character within the meaning of article 86 (2) of the
Swiss Financial Services Ordinance may not be offered or recommended to private clients within the
meaning of the FinSA in Switzerland.

**NOTICE TO ITALIAN INVESTORS**

The offer of the Notes has neither been registered with, nor cleared by, the Commissione Nazionale
_per la Società e la Borsa ("CONSOB") (the Italian securities exchange commission), pursuant to Italian_
securities legislation. Accordingly, no Notes may be offered, sold or delivered, directly or indirectly, in the
Republic of Italy, nor may copies of this Offering Memorandum or of any other offering circular, prospectus,

applicable laws and regulations.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered, sold or delivered, and will
not offer, sell or deliver, directly or indirectly, any Notes or distribute or publish any copy of this Offering
Memorandum or any other document relating to the Notes in Italy, except:

1 of the EU Prospectus Regulation, Article 34-ter of CONSOB Regulation No. 11971 of May 14, 1999,
as amended from time to time (the "Issuers' Regulation"), and any other applicable Italian laws and
regulations.

Any offer, sale or delivery of the Notes or distribution of copies of this Offering Memorandum or any
other document relating to the Notes in the Republic of Italy under paragraph (a) or (b) above must be
made:

(i) by _soggetti abilitati (including an investment firm, bank or financial intermediary permitted to_
conduct such activities in Italy in accordance with Legislative Decree No. 58 of 24 February 1998, as
amended from time to time (the "Financial Services Act"), Legislative Decree No. 385 of September
1, 1993 (the "Consolidated Banking Act") and CONSOB Regulation No. 20307 of February 15,
2018, all as amended from time to time); and

(ii) in compliance with any other applicable laws and regulations or requirements, including any
limitation or requirement that may be imposed from time to time by CONSOB, the Bank of Italy
(including the reporting requirements, where applicable, pursuant to Article 129 of the Consolidated
Banking Act and the relevant implementing guidelines of the Bank of Italy, as amended from time to
time) and/or any other Italian competent authority.

Any investor purchasing the Notes is solely responsible for ensuring that any offer or resale of the Notes

The Notes may not be sold, offered or distributed to persons in Spain nor may any subsequent resale
of the Notes be carried out in Spain, except in circumstances which do not qualify as a public offer (oferta
_pública) of securities in Spain, in accordance with article 35 of the Royal Legislative Decree 4/2015, of_
October 23, approving the amended and restated text of the Spanish Securities Market Law (Real Decreto
_Legislativo 4/2015, de 23 de octubre, por el que se aprueba el texto refundido de la Ley del Mercado de_

be in force from time to time. Neither the Notes, the Offering nor this offering memorandum and its contents
have been approved or registered with the Spanish Securities and Exchange Commission (Comisión
_Nacional del Mercado de Valores), and therefore it is not intended for the public offering of Notes in Spain._

**NOTICE TO FRENCH INVESTORS**

This Offering Memorandum has not been prepared in the context of a public offering of financial
securities in France within the meaning of the EU Prospectus Regulation and, therefore, has not been
approved by, or registered or filed with the Autorité des marchés financiers (the French financial markets
authority ("AMF")) and does not require a prospectus to be submitted for approval to the AMF.

Consequently, the Notes may not be, directly or indirectly, offered or sold to the public in France (offre
_au public de titres financiers) (other than to qualified investors and/or a restricted circle of investors acting_
for their own account), and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any offering or marketing materials
relating to the Notes may be made available or distributed in any way that would constitute, directly or
indirectly, an offer to the public in France (other than to qualified investors and/or a restricted circle of
investors acting for their own account).

The Notes may only be offered or sold in France to: (i) a restricted circle of investors acting for their
own account (cercle restreint d'investisseurs agissant pour compte propre) in accordance with Articles L.
411-2 and D. 411-4 of the French Code monétaire et financier and/or to qualified investors (investisseurs
_qualifiés) as defined by Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation. Prospective investors are informed_
that: (i) this Offering Memorandum or any other materials relating to this Offering Memorandum have not
been and will not be submitted for clearance to the AMF; (ii) in compliance with Article L.411-2 of the French
_Code monétaire et financier, the restricted circle of investors subscribing for the Notes should be acting for_

themselves about, and observe, any such restrictions.

**NOTICE TO AUSTRIAN INVESTORS**

This Offering Memorandum has not been and will not be approved and/or published pursuant to the
Austrian Capital Markets Act (Kapitalmarktgesetz), as amended ("KMG"), and has not been passported into
Austria pursuant to the EU Prospectus Regulation. Neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other
document connected therewith constitutes a prospectus according to the EU Prospectus Regulation and
neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other document connected therewith may be distributed,
passed on or disclosed to any person in Austria other than as permitted in this paragraph. No steps may
be taken that would constitute a public offering of the Notes in Austria and the offering of the Notes may
not be advertised in Austria. Any offer of the Notes in Austria may only be made to any legal entity which
is a "qualified investor" within the meaning of Article 2(e) of the EU Prospectus Regulation; and provided
that no such offer of the Notes shall require us or the Initial Purchasers to publish a prospectus pursuant
to Article 3 of the EU Prospectus Regulation. For the purposes of this provision, the expression a "public
offering of Notes" means any communication (whether originating from the Issuers or a financial
intermediary) to the public in any form and by any means, presenting sufficient information on the terms of
the offer and the Notes to be offered (or an invitation to subscribe such Notes), so as to enable an investor
to decide to purchase or subscribe to the Notes.

### NOTICE TO BELGIAN INVESTORS

This Offering Memorandum relates to a private placement of the Notes and does not constitute an
offer to the public in Belgium to subscribe for or acquire the Notes. The Notes may therefore not be

Regulation or the Belgian Law of 11 July 2018 on the public offering of investment instruments and the
admission of investment instruments to trading on a regulated market, as amended (the "Belgian

EU Prospectus Regulation and/or on the basis of any other exemption as referred to in Article 1, paragraph
4 of the EU Prospectus Regulation.

This offering is conducted exclusively under applicable private placement exemptions and therefore it

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION**

**General**

_The Issuers_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer are public limited companies incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales as private limited companies on September 3, 2020 and re-registered
as public limited companies on December 18 and 21, 2020, respectively, for the purpose of consummating
the Transactions. As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the Issuers are holding companies with no
revenue-generating activities of their own, and no business operations, material assets or liabilities other
than those incurred in connection with their incorporation and the Transactions.

As a result, no financial information of the Issuers is included in this Offering Memorandum.

For further information, please see "Summary Corporate and Financing Structure," "Business" and
"Description of Certain Financing Arrangements."

_The Company_

All historical financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum is that of the Company.
Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, all references to "ASDA," "we," "us," "our" or the "Company" in
respect of historical financial information in this Offering Memorandum are to the Company and its
subsidiaries, collectively. The Company is a private company limited by share capital incorporated under
the laws of England and Wales on October 27, 1978.

The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum includes:

  - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2017 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as
adopted by the European Union ("IFRS") (the "2017 Financial Statements");

  - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2018 prepared in accordance with IFRS (the "2018 Financial Statements");

  - the audited consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2019 prepared in accordance with IFRS (the "2019 Financial Statements"); and

  - the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of the Company as of and for
the nine months ended September 30, 2020 prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial
_Reporting as adopted by the European Union with comparable information as of December 31,_
2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 (the "Unaudited Condensed
**Consolidated Interim Financial Statements," and the 2017 Financial Statements, 2018 Financial**
Statements, 2019 Financial Statements and the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim
Financial Statements collectively being the "Financial Statements").

The 2017 Financial Statements, the 2018 Financial Statements and the 2019 Financial Statements
have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, as set forth in their audit reports included elsewhere herein.
Unless otherwise stated, no other financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum has been
audited.

The Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements do not include all notes of the type normally
included in an annual financial report. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the
2019 Financial Statements, except for the estimation of income tax expense, which has been recognised
based on the estimate of the weighted average effective annual income tax rate expected for the full
financial year, and the adoption of new and amended standards.

This Offering Memorandum includes unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended
September 30, 2020, which is calculated by adding the results of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subtracting
the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The financial information for
the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that
may be expected for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 or any future period, and should not be
used as the basis for or prediction of an annualised calculation. The unaudited financial information for
the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required
by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has
been prepared for illustrative purposes only.

-----

In this Offering Memorandum we present certain financial information related to periods prior to
2017. The financial information for periods prior to 2017 has been presented herein for illustrative
purposes only and investors should place no reliance on such information. This Offering Memorandum
does not include the audited financial statements for any period prior to 2017. There can be no assurance
that, had such information been audited or reviewed, there would not have been any discrepancies
(including material) compared to the financial information presented herein. The financial information
presented in this Offering Memorandum for periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2019 may not
be comparable to financial information for later periods, due to changes that have occurred to IFRS that
have occurred over time, in particular the significant changes caused by the adoption of IFRS 16 on
January 1, 2019 as described below.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical
accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying our
accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where
assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in the Financial
Statements. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates."_

In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this Offering
and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Prospective investors should consult
their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences between IFRS, generally accepted
accounting principles in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), UK GAAP and other systems of
generally accepted accounting principles and how these differences might affect the financial information
included in this Offering Memorandum, and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of IFRS
principles may have on our results of operations and/or financial condition, as well as on the comparability
of the prior periods.

With respect to the 2019 Financial Statements, the Company applied the new IFRS 16 (Leases)
accounting standard, effective from January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, as defined
by the IFRS 16 accounting standard. The cumulative effects of applying this new accounting standard were
therefore recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019 (the date of initial
application), while comparative figures were not restated. Additionally, previous lease-related balances
including operating lease prepayments, onerous lease provisions and straight-line rent accruals have been
derecognised as part of the Company's adoption of IFRS 16. The 2017 Financial Statements and the 2018
Financial Statements have not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16 and thus cannot be directly
compared to the 2019 Financial Statements, and the Company has not otherwise restated comparative
amounts as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2018. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification
of leases as either operating leases or finance leases for lessees and introduces a single lessee accounting
model with some exemptions for short-term and low-value leases. The lessee recognises a right-of-use
asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to
make lease payments. The effect of applying IFRS 16 is to align the presentation of leases more closely to
that of owned assets, rent expense is no longer deducted in arriving at operating profit or EBITDA and
instead profit before tax includes an interest charge on the unwinding of the lease liability and a depreciation
charge on the right of use asset. As a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, right of use assets of
£2,263.9 million and additional lease liabilities of £1,979.4 million were recognised as of January 1, 2019,
and operating costs decreased by £31.4 million and finance costs increased by £52.7 million compared
with lease-related expenses charged in the prior year under IAS 17. See note 1 ("Accounting Policies") of
the 2019 Financial Statements. For the avoidance of doubt, the historical financial information provided in
this Offering Memorandum in relation to IFRS 16 does not reflect the potential impact of the Forecourt
Assets Separation and the leases of the Select Retail Assets, the Substitute Retail Assets and the
Distribution Assets.

The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the
applicable accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the
SEC, which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC. There could be significant
differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP, as applied to the Company. We neither describe the differences
between IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile the Company's IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP.
Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and investors should consider this in making
their investment decision. The Indentures will impose no obligation on us to reconcile the Company's future
financial statements prepared under IFRS to U.S. GAAP.

See "Independent Auditors" for a description of the independent auditors' reports of Ernst & Young LLP.
In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the
independent auditors' reports from Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019,
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 state that Ernst & Young LLP does not assume responsibility

2


-----

to anyone (including holders of Notes) other than the Company, as a body, for its audit work or the audit
reports or opinions it has formed. Ernst & Young LLP has undertaken its audit work, in accordance with
Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, to state to the Company's members those matters that it
is required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose.

Investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements, the independent auditors
have confirmed that they do not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as the purchasers of the
Notes) other than to the Company and its members, as a body, with respect to the report and to the
independent auditors' audit work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be
included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities
registered under the U.S. Securities Act or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or
any other court) were to give effect to such limiting language, the recourse that investors in the Notes may
have against the independent auditor based on its report or the consolidated financial statements to which
it relates could be limited. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Financial, Reporting and Other Matters—
_The audit reports of Ernst & Young LLP included in this Offering Memorandum include statements_
_purporting to limit the persons that may rely on such reports and the opinions contained therein."_

**Unaudited Pro forma Adjusted Financial Information**

We present in this Offering Memorandum certain unaudited financial information adjusted to give pro
_forma effect to the Transactions ("As Adjusted Financial Information"). See "Summary Historical_
_Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial Data—Other Financial Data—Other Financial_
_Indicators" and "Capitalisation."_

The As Adjusted Financial Information included in this Offering Memorandum has not been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of Regulation S-X of the U.S. Securities Act or any generally accepted
accounting standards. The assumptions underlying the As Adjusted Financial Information have not been
audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted accounting standards. Any reliance you
place on this information should fully take this into consideration.

The As Adjusted Financial Information has been provided for informational purposes only. Results
indicated by certain of these measures may not be realised, and funds depicted by certain of these
measures may not be available for management's discretionary use if such results are not realised. Further,
the As Adjusted Financial Information does not purport to indicate our future consolidated results of
operations or our cash position or financial position as at any future date. The actual results may differ
significantly from those reflected in the unaudited pro forma financial information for a number of reasons,
including, but not limited to, differences in assumptions used to prepare the As Adjusted Financial
Information.

The As Adjusted Financial Information should be read in conjunction with the information contained in
"Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial Data," "Selected
_Consolidated Financial Information," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and_
_Results of Operations" and "Risk Factors" and the financial statements included in this Offering_
Memorandum.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

In this Offering Memorandum the Company presents certain financial measures that are not required
by or presented in accordance with IFRS (the "Non-IFRS Measures"). The Non-IFRS Measures included
in this Offering Memorandum do not alone provide a sufficient basis to compare the ASDA Group's
performance with that of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for
an equivalent IFRS measure (if applicable) or any other generally accepted measure as an indicator of
operating performance or liquidity. Such non-IFRS financial information has not been audited or reviewed
by Ernst & Young LLP.

We believe that the presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures enhances an investor's understanding of
our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that EBITDA is a
measure commonly used by investors. The Company's Non-IFRS Measures may not be directly
comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. The EBITDA Measures (as defined
below) and related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of financial performance under
IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash
flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. You are encouraged to
evaluate each of the adjustments reflected in the Company's presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures and
whether you consider each to be appropriate. In addition, each of the Non-IFRS Measures may be defined
differently from the definitions of corresponding or similar terms under the Indentures. The Company's NonIFRS Measures have important limitations as analytical tools. Some limitations of the Non-IFRS Measures
include:

3


-----

  - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or
principal payments on the Company's debt;

  - they do not reflect any cash income and certain other taxes that the Company may be required to
pay;

  - they are not adjusted for all cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Company's
statements of cash flows;

  - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters the Company
considers not to be indicative of its ongoing operations;

  - following the implementation of IFRS 16, they do not reflect any expense relating to leased assets
classified as interest or depreciation;

  - in respect of Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and the other Non-IFRS Measures
that reflect such measures, they reflect certain adjustments for anticipated cost savings, synergies
and other estimates that may not be realised, whether in part or at all; and

  - they may not fully take into account the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's financial
performance.

Furthermore, you should carefully consider the risks and limitations of the Non-IFRS Measures, as they
are based in part on assumptions made by the Company's management regarding the future impact of
actions that have not yet been, and which may not in fact be, implemented. For example, there is a risk
that the synergies we seek to achieve may not be realised in the anticipated time frame or at all and that
the magnitude of cost savings may be significantly less than expected.

Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of
discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will
be available to us to meet our obligations, including in relation to the Notes offered hereby. You should
compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the ASDA Group's IFRS results and using these
Non-IFRS Measures only in a supplemental manner to evaluate the ASDA Group's performance.

Our primary Non-IFRS Measures are defined as follows:

_EBITDA_

EBITDA, when used in this Offering Memorandum, is calculated by adding back to the Company's profit
for the period income tax expense, finance income, finance costs and amortisation and depreciation. By
eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as
depreciation and amortisation, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we
believe EBITDA can provide a useful additional basis for comparing our operating performance with
industry peers.

_EBITDA Margin_

EBITDA Margin means the Company's EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue for the relevant period.

_Adjusted EBITDA_

Adjusted EBITDA, when used in this Offering Memorandum, means the Company's EBITDA for a
particular period as adjusted for certain historical costs, including impairment charges for both tangible,
intangible and leased assets, asset write-offs, elimination of IFRS 16 impact, pension guarantees, share
option costs and the removal of one-time items including ATM ("Automated Teller Machines") tax rebates,
one-off bonus payments, one-off contract implementation costs, estimated merger costs in relation to the
proposed merger with Sainsburys, increased pension contributions as a result of changes in eligibility
criteria and restructuring costs relating to significant restructuring programmes.

4


-----

_Adjusted EBITDA Margin_

Adjusted EBITDA Margin means the Company's Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue
(including petrol) for the relevant period.

_Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA_

_Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, when used in this Offering Memorandum, means the Company's Adjusted_
EBITDA for a particular period as adjusted for the removal of Walmart royalties and IT costs and their
replacement with new costs under the TSA with Walmart, other adjustments including the impact of the
2020 leap year and estimated costs relating to ASDA operating as a standalone group, one-off net impact
of costs and benefits associated with COVID-19 and adjustment for certain anticipated cost savings, EG
foodservice partnership synergies, synergies from the roll-out of the ASDA wholesale convenience
business, the EBITDA associated with the Forecourt Assets and the Excluded Forecourts and the rent
associated with the Warehouse Assets and Select Retail Assets.

The Company believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (collectively,
the "EBITDA Measures") provide useful information to investors about its results of operations for the
following reasons: (a) they are, or will be going forward, among the measures used by the Company's
Board of Directors and management to evaluate the ASDA Group's underlying operating performance,
review business trends, identify strategies to improve results and make day-to-day operating decisions,
and (b) they allow a comparison of the Company's results across periods and results across companies in
the industry in which the ASDA Group operates on a consistent basis, by removing the effects on the ASDA
Group's operating performance of its capital structure (such as the varying levels of interest expense), asset
base and capital investment cycle (such as depreciation and amortisation) and items largely outside the
control of management (such as income taxes).

None of the EBITDA Measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of the
ASDA Group's operating performance reported in accordance with IFRS. The EBITDA Measures have
limitations as analytical tools, some of which are as follows:

  - the EBITDA Measures do not reflect the Group's cash expenditures or future requirements for
capital investments or contractual commitments;

  - the EBITDA Measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Group's working
capital needs;

  - none of the EBITDA Measures reflects the interest expense on the Group's debt or the cash
requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Group's debt;

  - although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges, assets are depreciated or amortised
over differing estimated useful lives and the assets being depreciated and amortised will often have
to be replaced in the future, and the EBITDA Measures do not reflect any cash requirements for
such replacements;

  - the EBITDA Measures exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash
available to the Group;

  - the EBITDA Measures are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected
in the Company's income statement;

  - other companies in the industry in which the Group operates may calculate their own EBITDA
measures differently than the Company does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures;

  - our calculation and presentation of the EBITDA Measures in this Offering Memorandum is similar
to, but different from, the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA under the Indentures governing the
Notes offered hereby or the agreements governing our Revolving Credit Facilities. In particular,
EBITDA reflects the adoption of IFRS 16 by the Company effective January 1, 2019, while Adjusted
EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA calculations under the Indentures may not. Accordingly
the EBITDA Measures do not provide precise indications as to the level of our adherence to the
terms of our Indentures and the agreements governing our Revolving Credit Facilities; and

  - certain adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA_
contain estimates that management believes reflect the underlying results of operations and are
therefore subjective in nature and reflect certain adjustments for anticipated cost savings,
synergies and other estimates that may not be realised, whether in part or at all.

_Like-for-like sales growth (excluding petrol)_

Like-for-like sales growth (excluding petrol) is a measure of annual growth of sales (excluding VAT)

5


-----

calculated as comparable current year sales minus prior year sales for the current year comparable sales
divided by prior year sales for the current year comparable sales. Current year comparable sales includes
all revenue except petrol sales, sales generated from stores in the first twelve complete calendar months
following grand opening, sales generated from stores that have permanently closed, sales generated from
stores that have been temporarily closed for more than two consecutive complete calendar months within
the previous twelve full calendar months, financial services commissions, toyou sales and George
international franchise sales.

_Free Cash Flow_

Free Cash Flow is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure. The ASDA Group uses Free
Cash Flow as a liquidity measure to monitor cash flow generation.

The Company presents Free Cash Flow because, in the Company's view, it provides investors with
useful information about the Company's underlying ability to generate and extract cash flows from its
various subsidiaries in order to make interest and principal payments on the Group's debt, including the
Notes offered hereby.

Free Cash Flow is not a measure of liquidity under IFRS and has limitations as an analytical tool, some
of which are as follows:

  - it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures by the ASDA
Group, particularly because, in the case of pre-tax free cash flow, the ASDA Group's various tax
payment obligations are not deducted from such measure;

  - it does not deduct cash flows used by the ASDA Group in financing activities;

  - it is not a direct measurement of cash flows and attempts to derive and measure the ASDA Group's
ability to service debt from income statement data of the Company. Accordingly, it does not directly
correlate to the actual collection of cash. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not take into account
changes in working capital of the ASDA Group that are otherwise factored in when calculating its
net cash from operating activities;

  - it does not deduct certain other items settled in cash; and

  - other companies in the industries in which the ASDA Group operates may calculate Free Cash
Flow differently than it does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.

_Cash Conversion_

Cash conversion is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA.

_Capital expenditure_

Capital expenditure is defined as the total cost of assets classified as property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets that the Company takes ownership of within a financial period (as opposed to the IFRS
measurement of capital expenditure, which is based on cash flows).

_Pro forma net debt_

_Pro forma net debt consists of the Issuers' pro forma indebtedness in respect of the Notes, the Term_
Loan Facilities and leases, net of ASDA's estimated average cash and cash equivalents from January 4 to
February 2, 2021 (inclusive), as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions
on the Acquisition Completion Date. Pro forma net debt does not include any indebtedness in respect of
the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, which is expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the
Warehouse Sale Transactions, or the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, which is expected to be repaid
with the proceeds of the Forecourt Assets Disposal. See "Capitalisation." Our presentation and calculation
of the ratio of _Pro forma_ net debt to _Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is different from the calculation of_
Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio under the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement and is not
indicative of our level of adherence to the terms of the Indentures or the Senior Facilities Agreement. See
"Description of the Senior Secured Notes," "Description of the Senior Notes" and "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements."_

_Pro forma net senior secured debt_

_Pro forma net senior secured debt consists of the Issuers'_ _pro forma indebtedness in respect of the_
Senior Secured Notes and the Term Loan Facilities, net of ASDA's estimated average cash and cash
equivalents from January 4 to February 2, 2021 (inclusive), as adjusted to give _pro forma effect to the_
consummation of the Transactions on the Acquisition Completion Date. Pro forma net senior secured debt
does not include any indebtedness in respect of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, which is
expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the Warehouse Sale Transactions, or the Forecourt Disposal
Bridge Facility, which is expected to be repaid with the proceeds of the Forecourt Assets Disposal. See
"Capitalisation." Our presentation and calculation of the ratio of Pro forma net senior secured debt to Pro
_forma Adjusted EBITDA is different from the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage_
Ratio under the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement and is not indicative of our level of
adherence to the terms of the Indentures or the Senior Facilities Agreement. See "Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes" and "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements."_

_Pro forma interest expense_

_Pro forma interest expense reflects the blended interest expense associated with the Notes, Term Loan_
Facilities and our leases for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, as if the Transactions had occurred
on October 1, 2019. Pro forma interest expense excludes charges related to allocated debt issuance costs,
leases of Warehouse Assets or Select Retail Assets or other indebtedness. Pro forma interest expense
has been presented for illustrative purposes only and does not purport to represent what our interest
expense would have actually been had the above mentioned transactions occurred on the date assumed,
nor does it purport to project our interest expense for any future period or our financial condition at any
future date.

**Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Measures**

We present a reconciliation of the EBITDA Measures, Free Cash Flow and Cash Conversion to the
most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with IFRS and discuss their
limitations. For a reconciliation of these Non-IFRS Measures and such discussions, see "Summary
_Consolidated Financial and Other Financial Data—Other Financial Data."_

**Other Financial, Operational and As Adjusted Data**

This Offering Memorandum includes certain key performance indicators and other financial, nonfinancial operational and as adjusted data. This information has been provided for informational purposes
only and should not be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the as
adjusted for transactions been completed on the dates indicated and do not purport to indicate our future
consolidated results of operations or financial position. Our use or computation of these indicators may not
be comparable with the use or computation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies. None
of the key performance indicators or other non-financial operating data included in this Offering
Memorandum should be considered in isolation or as an alternative to any indicator of our operating
performance, cash flows or other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. See
"Summary Historical Consolidated Financial Information and Other Financial Data." These data have been
prepared solely for the purpose of this Offering Memorandum, some of which may not be prepared in the
ordinary course of our financial reporting, may not be part of our financial statements and may not have
not been audited.

**Rounding Adjustments**

Certain numerical figures set out in this Offering Memorandum, including financial data presented in
millions or thousands, certain operating data, percentages describing market share and penetration rates,
have been subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals of the data included in this Offering
Memorandum may vary slightly from the actual arithmetic totals of such information. Percentages and
amounts reflecting changes over time periods relating to financial and other data set forth in the sections
entitled _"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"_ are
calculated using the numerical data in the consolidated financial information of the Company or the tabular
presentation of other data (subject to rounding) contained in this Offering Memorandum, as applicable, and
not using the numerical data in the narrative description thereof. Figures shown as totals in some tables
and elsewhere may not be exact arithmetic aggregations of the figures that precede them.

All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Offering Memorandum,
including, without limitation, statements regarding the Group's future financial position, risks and
uncertainties related to the Group's business, strategy, capital expenditures and the Group's plans and
objectives for future operations, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. These forward- looking
statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those identified under the "Risk
_Factors" section in this Offering Memorandum. Words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "may,"_
"assume," "plan," "intend," "will," "should," "estimate," "risk," "target," "objectives," "outlook," "probably,"
"project," "seek" and similar expressions or the negatives of these expressions are intended to identify
forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time the Group or its representatives, acting in
respect of information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking statements orally or in
writing and these forward-looking statements may be included in but are not limited to press releases
(including on the Group's website), reports to the Group's security holders and other communications.
Although the Group believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are
reasonable, the Group can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Any forwardlooking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and the Group undertakes no obligation
to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to
persons acting on the Group's behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements
referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including those set forth under
the section entitled "Risk Factors." The COVID-19 situation adds significant uncertainty to our operating
environment and may have the effect of magnifying the impact of the risk factors described herein and
may lead to unanticipated further risks.

The risks described in the "Risk Factors" section in this Offering Memorandum are not exhaustive.
Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect the
Group's business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, the Group operates in a very
competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not
possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can the Group assess the impact of all such risk factors
on its business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to
differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements, particularly in regards to forwardlooking statements relating to or which may be impacted by the COVID-19 situation. Given these risks
and uncertainties, you should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of
actual results.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the
consequences of purchasing, holding and disposing of the Notes, including, without limitation, the
application of U.S. Federal, United Kingdom and Jersey tax laws to their particular situations, as well as
any consequences to them under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction, and the consequences of
purchasing the Notes at prices other than the initial issue prices in the Offering. See "Certain Tax
_Considerations."_

**HISTORICAL AND CURRENT MARKET AND INDUSTRY DATA**

It is difficult to obtain precise industry and market information in the Group's industry. Historical and
current market and competitive position data, as well as statistical data, estimates and forecasts that are
based on independent industry publications, surveys or studies conducted by management or by thirdparty industry consultants and market research firms such as Euromonitor International Limited
("Euromonitor"): Retailing 2020 Edition, Kantar Worldpanel ("Kantar") and the Office for National
Statistics ("ONS"), or other publicly available information from sources that are generally believed to be
reliable, as well as other information based on our internal sources, are used throughout this Offering
Memorandum, including in the sections "Summary," "Risk Factors," "Management's Discussion and
_Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," "Industry" and "Business." With respect to_
Kantar data presented in this Offering Memorandum, references to the "United Kingdom" do not include
Northern Ireland. Industry surveys and publications generally state that the information contained therein
has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but the accuracy and completeness of information
contained therein is not guaranteed. While the Group accepts responsibility for the accurate extraction and
reproduction of this market data, the Group has not independently verified such data and cannot guarantee
its accuracy or completeness.

Some of the information herein has also been extrapolated from market data, reports, surveys and
studies using our experience and internal estimates. Elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, statements
regarding the industry in which we operate and our position in this industry are based solely on our
experience, internal studies, estimates and surveys, and our own investigation of market conditions. We
believe that the sources of such information in this Offering Memorandum are reliable, but there can be no
assurance that any of these assumptions is accurate or correctly reflects our position in our industry, and
none of our internal surveys or information has been verified by any independent sources. Further, the data
and statistical information in this Offering Memorandum may differ from information provided by our
competitors or from information found in current or future studies conducted by market research institutes,
consultancy firms or independent sources. While the Group is not aware of any misstatements regarding
any industry or similar data presented herein, such data involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to
change based on various factors, including those discussed under the "Risk Factors" section in this Offering
Memorandum. As a result, neither we nor any of the Initial Purchasers make any representation as to the
accuracy or completeness of any such information in this Offering Memorandum.

All the information set forth in this Offering Memorandum relating to the industry and markets in which
the Company operates has been obtained from independent research, unless otherwise indicated. Neither
the Issuers nor any of the Initial Purchasers have independently verified this information and cannot
guarantee its accuracy.

The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the industry and markets in which we operate. Both
the extent of such adverse impact and the time it may take for the COVID-19 pandemic to end and for our
industry and markets to recover from it remain uncertain. Accordingly, the industry publications, reports,
surveys or studies from third-party data providers to which this Offering Memorandum refers, even if and
where updated to reflect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including relating to market evolution and
market share estimates may not, in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, accurately reflect the
current or expected market conditions, trends and growth rates. As the COVID-19 impact is ongoing, even
such industry publications, reports, surveys or studies from third-party data providers to which this Offering
Memorandum refers and which purport to reflect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as applicable, are
inherently incomplete as to the full effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. See "Industry" and "Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—The impact of_
_COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to create uncertainty in_
_our market and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations for the_
_foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control."_

**TRADE MARKS AND TRADE NAMES**

We have proprietary and/or licence rights to certain trade marks or trade names that we use in
conjunction with the operation of our businesses. We do not intend our use or display of other companies'
trade marks or trade names to imply a relationship with, or endorsement or sponsorship of us by, any other
companies. Each trade mark, trade name or service mark of any other company appearing in this Offering
Memorandum belongs to its respective holder. Solely for convenience, the trade marks, trade names and
copyrights referred to in this Offering Memorandum may be listed without the ©, ® and ™ symbols, but we
will assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights or the rights of the applicable licensor to
these trade marks, trade names and copyrights.

**BROKERS' OPINIONS OF PRICING**

**The Brokers' Opinions of Pricing**

The Issuers received a broker's opinion of pricing dated November 26, 2020 and prepared as of October
20, 2020 issued by external real estate adviser Newsteer Real Estate Advisers ("Newsteer") related to the
ASDA Group's portfolio of 485 properties comprising 483 trading stores and two offices held on a freehold
and long leasehold basis (the "ASDA Store and Office Portfolio") (inclusive of the Select Retail Assets
and the Substitute Retail Assets) and a broker's opinion of pricing dated November 17, 2020 and prepared
as of October 20, 2020 issued by external real estate adviser Colliers International ("Colliers") related to
the ASDA Group's portfolio of 31 distribution sites held on a freehold and long leasehold basis (the "ASDA
**Distribution Sites Portfolio" and, together with the ASDA Store and Office Portfolio, the "ASDA Property**
**Portfolio") (the broker's opinion of pricing from Newsteer and the broker's opinion of pricing from Colliers**
are referred to collectively in this Offering Memorandum as the "Brokers' Opinions of Pricing"). The ASDA
Property Portfolio does not, and thus the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing do not, include certain other
properties, including retail rack-rented leasehold properties (131 properties), office leasehold properties
(one property), standalone petrol forecourts (18 properties), non-operational properties (ten freehold
properties and seven leasehold properties) and non-UK properties (five properties). The Brokers' Opinions
of Pricing also do not include opinions of pricing relating to petrol forecourts on a standalone basis (save
that where trading stores benefit from petrol forecourts, Newsteer has reflected the existence of petrol
forecourts with an addition of 5% to the base shell rental pricing for the relevant trading stores). Additionally,
the ASDA Property Portfolio does not, and thus the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing do not, reflect any income
received from tenants, concessions or third-party interests.

The Brokers' Opinions of Pricing are intended to be guides to the likely pricing of the ASDA Property
Portfolio prior to negotiation and/or agency instructions as may occur during a routine sales process. The
Brokers' Opinions of Pricing were not prepared in accordance with the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors' Valuation–Global Standards (the "RICS Red Book Global Standards").

**Key Findings**

Subject to the facts, assumptions and qualifications set out in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing and
summarised below, the ASDA Store and Office Portfolio had an aggregate capital pricing of £9,354,700,000
as of October 20, 2020 (based on 485 sites). The ASDA Distribution Sites Portfolio had an aggregate capital
pricing of £925,700,000 (based on 31 sites) as of October 20, 2020. The Select Retail Assets had an
aggregate capital pricing of £483,794,000 (based on 23 sites) and the Substitute Retail Assets had an
aggregate capital pricing of £639,501,000 (based on 15 sites), in each case as of October 20, 2020. The
capital pricing of the properties located in each of the jurisdictions where real estate will be pledged as
collateral (including the Select Retail Assets and the Substitute Retail Assets (but, in the case of the latter,
only if consents, approvals or certifications are outstanding at the relevant time in relation to the grant of
leases and security interests in respect of any Warehouse Asset or the transfer of any Warehouse Asset
to Bellis Select Warehouse Limited, or the registration of any of the foregoing, in each case as required
pursuant to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility)) for the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility is broken down as follows: (i) based on the Colliers broker's opinion of pricing of the ASDA
Distribution Sites Portfolio (which, for the purposes of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility,
comprises 30 distribution properties): £820,000,000 in England, £62,200,000 in Scotland and £24,300,000
in Wales (total aggregate capital pricing: £906,500,000); (ii) based on the Newsteer broker's opinion of
pricing of the Select Retail Assets: £420,958,000 in England and £62,836,000 in Scotland (total aggregate
capital pricing: £483,794,000) and (iii) based on the Newsteer broker's opinion of pricing of the Substitute
Retail Assets (which includes the addition of 5% to the base shell rental pricing to reflect the existence of
petrol forecourts): £629,301,000 in England and £10,200,000 in Wales (total aggregate capital pricing:
£639,501,000). See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our
_General Operations—We rent certain of our properties pursuant to commercial leases that may be subject_
_to adjustments that could increase expenses and have a materially adverse impact on our business, results_
_of operations and financial condition," "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Financial, Reporting and Other_
_Matters—We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures_
_followed in the third-party brokers' opinions of pricing of our portfolio of real estate assets are correct,_
_accurate or complete."_

**Reliance**

The information presented in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing is presented for illustrative purposes only.
The Brokers' Opinions of Pricing are strictly confidential and provided only for the purposes of the
Transaction and providing an indication of pricing for the benefit of the Issuers in connection with the
preparation of this Offering Memorandum (the "Original Purposes"). Newsteer and Colliers have accepted
no responsibility whatsoever to any third party for any part of the contents of the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing
and as such no third party may rely upon the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing.

Prospective investors should be aware that the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing were prepared as of October
20, 2020 and are not as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Neither Newsteer nor Colliers has been
requested to update or revise any of the information contained in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing as of any
later date or the date of this Offering Memorandum, nor will they be asked to do so prior to the issuance of
the Notes or at any later date. Accordingly, the information included in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing may
not reflect the current physical, economic, competitive, market or other conditions with respect to the Group
Property Portfolio.

Commercial property is generally bought and sold by reference to its security of income generation,
development potential, future rent generation or potential for capital growth. Any events that have a material
impact on a property's ability to trade or the development of the immediate vicinity can consequently have
a significant effect on pricing, more so than other property types. Examples of such events are:

    - macroeconomic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere;

    - an economic downturn, including as a result of COVID-19;

    - potential changes to the competitive landscape for grocery retail;

    - capital expenditure requirements;

    - changes in occupier and investor demand;

    - supply and demand generally affecting pricing;

    - adaptability or obsolescence;

    - regulation (e.g. minimum energy efficiency standards);

    - changes in consumer behaviour and shopping habits, either from gradual changes over time
or as a result of any other event listed above or under "Risk Factors" in this Offering
Memorandum; and

    - other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum.

The foregoing factors and others described under "Risk Factors" should not be construed as exhaustive.

Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on the Brokers' Opinions
of Pricing. Pricings change over time and an opinion of pricing given on a particular date may not be valid
on an earlier or later date, when both market conditions and sale circumstances may be different as a result
of which we may not be able to realise such pricing upon a disposal. As neither Newsteer, Colliers nor any
other external real estate adviser has been requested to update or revise the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing
or prepare new opinions of pricing of the ASDA Property Portfolio for any date after October 20, 2020, if an
opinion of pricing of the ASDA Property Portfolio was conducted today there can be no assurance that it
would not be materially different from the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing. As a result, the information contained
in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing may no longer reflect the characteristics of the property portfolio as of
the date of this Offering Memorandum or any date thereafter. Prospective investors should be aware that
the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing have been issued on the basis that they can only be relied upon by the
Issuers for the Original Purposes.

**Basis of Brokers' Opinions of Pricing**

The Brokers' Opinions of Pricing of the relevant properties have been prepared on the basis of existing
use of such properties, as supermarkets, offices or distribution warehouses. The opinions of pricing do not
reflect any alternative use, intensification or development of use of these properties.

In order to conduct its opinion of pricing, both Newsteer and Colliers relied on floor areas of the relevant
properties as provided by ASDA and Newsteer and Colliers have assumed that these floor areas have
been defined in compliance with the RICS Measurement Standards. For the purposes of its opinion of

18


-----

pricing, Colliers also relies on floor areas for certain of the properties that were measured by its rating
department under a separate instruction from ASDA, which comply with the current edition of RICS
Measurement Standards. Both Brokers' Opinions' of Pricing have been produced on a desktop basis only
without visual inspection of the properties and without undertaking the typical due diligence that would
normally be entered into by a purchaser. See "—Terms and Assumptions" and "—Methodology" for further
assumptions providing the basis of the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing.

**Terms and Assumptions**

The opinions of pricing of all properties were based on their existing use of the properties. Newsteer
and Colliers made various assumptions as to tenure, letting, taxation, town planning, and the condition and
repair of buildings and sites—including, among other things, ground conditions and contamination. If any
of the information or assumptions on which the studies are based are subsequently found to be incorrect,
the opinions of pricing may also be incorrect and should be reconsidered.

In particular, in preparation of their respective broker's opinion of pricing, Newsteer and Colliers
assumed each property to be the authorised use under planning legislation and in accordance with the use
registered with the relevant regulatory agency. During the course of their engagement, Newsteer and
Colliers did not perform site inspections, environmental audit, tests of services and amenities, investigations
or tests as to the condition of the properties. Newsteer and Colliers did not make planning or permitting
enquiries and did not examine deeds, leases or other documents in respect of tenure or title to the ASDA
Group's properties, building structure and condition, planning, environmental or other statutory information.
The Brokers' Opinions of Pricing assumed, among others, that as at October 20, 2020 (i) in the case of
Newsteer, the properties are let to ASL and in the case of Colliers, the properties are let to ASDA or to a
AAA-tenant, which could include ASDA, and in both cases that ASDA are in the market for all the properties
and benefits from an excellent rating, such as AAA and a very low risk of failure, (ii) all properties are
freehold or long leasehold and all title, tenure, lettings, planning, taxation, statutory and local authority
requirements are complied with and all properties possess a good and marketable title free from any
onerous restrictions or conditions, (iii) all properties benefit from full access and egress rights together with
sufficient parking and loading facilities and are connected to all main services, (iv) all properties are free
from defect, in good repair and condition and well maintained and in marketable condition, compliant with
all building, accessibility and fire safety regulations and there are no abnormalities as to repair and condition
of the properties, (v) the properties have no environmental issues such as contamination, deleterious
materials, flooding, ground conditions, invasive or protected plants or species and the properties are not
adversely affected by any existing or proposed environmental law, (vi) the floor areas provided to Newsteer
and Colliers by ASDA comply with the RICS Standards for measurement (other than those properties which
were measured by Colliers as part of separate instruction and which comply with the edition of the RICS
Measurement Standards current as at the date of this Offering Memorandum and upon which Colliers have
relied for the purposes of their opinion on pricing) and (vii) no capital expenditure is required in respect of
the properties. Both Colliers and Newsteer have assumed that each property is a vacant shell unit which
benefits from fully capped off services and no tenant fit-outs or fixtures and fittings beyond a typical
specification with which a vacant shell unit would be let or sold have been taken into account in the
respective broker's opinion of pricing.

**Methodology**

The Brokers' Opinions of Pricing have been prepared on the basis of "capital pricing" and have been
arrived at using comparable transactional evidence of leasing and sales transactions, adjusted to reflect
the characteristics of the properties in the ASDA Property Portfolio. Capital pricing as determined by
Newsteer and Colliers is based on certain qualifications and assumptions (including as to market
participants (e.g., that there is a willing lessor and willing lessee, as well as a willing vendor and purchaser,
in terms of demand for the properties in the open market, liens or other encumbrances, and the condition
and repair of buildings and sites, including environmental matters), estimates and projections. In both
cases, Newsteer and Colliers have assumed that the properties are fully leased at market rates as of
October 20, 2020. Newsteer has also assumed that the properties are open for business and trading as of
October 20, 2020 and are trading at sufficient levels that warrant the opinion of pricing.

Colliers has determined capital pricing by assuming an "all-risks" yield to the annual rent assumed under
a rental price exercise. The rental price exercise applies an overall rental price per square foot based on
the gross internal floor area of each building. The yield assumes that any occupier would have an
institutional-grade covenant similar to the leading grocery operators or other national or international
logistics firms, which could include ASDA. The rent and yield approach is cross-checked with a capital price
per square foot analysis that uses comparable transactional evidence. Benchmarks were drawn from recent

19

transactions of similar properties in similar locations in the marketplace and a certain rent and yield range
was then applied depending on the characteristics of the properties and their locations. The yield range
applied varies from approximately 4.5% to 9.5% depending on the characteristics of the properties and
their locations. For each property, it is assumed that the property is subject to an occupational lease as of
October 20, 2020 on the following terms: (a) 20-year term to a AAA-rated tenant, (b) yearly indexation of
the rent based on Retail Price Index with 1% / 3% collar and cap, (c) no open market rent review, (d) full
repairing and insuring lease terms, (e) on institutional terms which are acceptable to landlords and tenants
typical of the properties, and (f) the lease has the benefit of security of tenure pursuant to the Landlord and
Tenant Act 1954. Colliers has not deducted any void costs nor any non-recoverable costs but assumes a
deduction of standard purchaser's costs applicable to property assets in determining capital pricing of the
ASDA Distribution Sites Portfolio.

Newsteer has determined capital pricing in the case of freehold properties by applying an estimated net
initial yield in perpetuity to the annual rent assumed under a rental price exercise for the freehold properties.
For long leasehold properties, Newsteer has applied an estimated term yield for the remaining term to the
profit rent assumed under a rental price exercise having disregarded any rent review provisions for the long
leasehold properties. In each case, the yield assumes that the occupier would have an institutional-grade
covenant similar to the leading grocery operators. Benchmarks were drawn from recent transactions of
similar properties in similar locations in the marketplace. The rental price exercise applies an overall rental
price per square foot based on the gross internal floor area of each store and the net internal floor area of
each office. For each store property that benefits from a petrol filling station, Newsteer has reflected the
existence of a petrol filling station with an addition of 5% to the base shell rental pricing for the stores. For
each property, it is assumed that the property is subject to an occupational lease on the following terms:
(a) 20-year term to an institutional-grade tenant, (b) five yearly upwards only open market rent reviews on
a shell basis with appropriate rent-free incentives, (c) on institutional terms which are acceptable to
landlords and tenants typical of the properties and (d) assuming that ASL is in occupation and that ASDA
would have bid competitively for the properties at the time of letting and paid the market rent assessment.
Newsteer has not deducted any voids nor any non-recoverable costs and has not deducted standard
purchaser's costs, thereby reporting on a gross capital pricing basis.

We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed
in the capital pricing of the ASDA Group's properties are correct, accurate or complete. For example, if the
properties were assumed to be held with vacant possession, rather than being assumed to be occupied,
the capital pricing would be materially lower. Any opinions or conclusions reached in the Brokers' Opinions
of Pricing depend upon these assumptions, estimates and projections, some or all of which may or may
not occur or prove to be relevant. In addition, the methodologies and assumptions used in the Brokers'
Opinions of Pricing may differ from those underlying our projections and estimates contained elsewhere in
this Offering Memorandum.

The foregoing are brokers' opinions of pricing as set forth in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing and are
distinct from the book value recorded on the ASDA's statement of financial position in respect of the Group's
properties in the "Property, plant and equipment" and "Investment properties" line items on the statement
of financial position of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. The Brokers'
Opinions of Pricing have not been prepared in accordance with IAS 16 "Property, Plant and Equipment" or
IAS 40 "Investment Property," which are the accounting principles applicable to the ASDA Group's property
and investment properties. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
_of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations—Significant Real Estate Asset Portfolio."_

**OVERVIEW**

We are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom and the second-largest grocery retailer
in the North of England, Scotland and Wales (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a
52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). We operate a significant store estate of
614 stores (excluding standalone PFSs) that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom.
We also have the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery
Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). The graph below
compares our total grocery market share with that of other major UK grocery retailers.

(Source: Kantar. Based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020. *Ocado Market share
shown.)

We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by
favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household
expenditure on food and beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through
economic fluctuations. Groceries are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe
generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail
markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in
recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic. See also
"Industry."

One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is
in turn centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to "Every
Day Low Price" and our wholly-owned supplier, IPL, which enables us to take a vertically-integrated
approach to procurement and which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other
key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and well-established George Clothing and
George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers and our team of flexible and engaged
colleagues. Historically, we have benefited from the support of Walmart, our former parent company. We
will continue to receive support from Walmart over the next three years pursuant to the Transitional
Agreements negotiated in connection with the Acquisition. For more information about the ongoing support
to be provided by Walmart, please see "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—
_Transitional Agreements with Walmart" and "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are_
_risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart."_

We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, our revenue was approximately £22.9 billion (including petrol), of which approximately
£2 billion was online sales, and our Adjusted EBITDA was approximately £1.2 billion (including petrol).

The chart below presents the breakdown of our 2019 revenue by product category (food, general
merchandise, clothing and petrol), food category (ambient and fresh and produce) and channel (stores and
online (including George.com)).

(Source: ASDA information. Year ended December 31, 2019. Note: Does not include £61 million of other revenue.)
Our differentiated operating model has resulted in strong financial performance: our successful financial
profile is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA
less capital expenditure) and cash conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA)
in recent years. In 2018 and 2019, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.5% (including petrol), our
cumulative free cash flow was approximately £1.7 billion and our average cash conversion was
approximately 70%. The charts below show our EBITDA Margins, Adjusted EBITDA Margins, Unadjusted
Cash Conversion ("Unadjusted Cash Conversion" is calculated as Unadjusted Free Cash Flow divided
by EBITDA) and Unadjusted Free Cash Flow ("Unadjusted Free Cash Flow" is calculated as EBITDA
less capital expenditure) for the years ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2019 and our cash
conversion and free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019.

(Source: ASDA information.)

We believe that our business, operating model and financial performance also benefit from our
significant freehold real estate asset portfolio. See "Brokers' Opinions of Pricing."

We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we
maintain a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom. Within
the UK value market, we have strong market shares across ambient products (13.0%), fresh/chilled
(11.6%) and total grocery (12.2%) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52
weeks ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). Our offer is strong across the full food basket: our
category market shares range from 12% to 14% (except household and toiletries) (in each case in terms
of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). We
believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to
internal ASDA data, our prices are approximately 6% to 7.5% less expensive than our traditional grocer
competitors (on a 2020 year-to-date (weeks 1-42) average, based on total goods price gap percentage).

Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is
supplemented by a large clothing and general merchandise business. We offer our entire range of food
and non-food products to customers as a convenient "one-stop shop" experience that is supported and
enhanced by our strong online offer. We believe our omni-channel offer, through which we reach customers
at our brick-and-mortar stores, through our significant online offering and on our app, appeals to our
customers. In 2020, there were approximately 9.8 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with
approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days
ended February 28, 2020), and approximately 723,000 weekly orders post COVID-19 (based on the
average orders for the seven days ended September 30, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has increased
use of and engagement with our online platforms and we currently fulfil approximately 720,000 online
orders per week. Our online grocery business operates from 350 stores, we offer at-home delivery and
customers are also able to collect their purchases at one of approximately 460 ASDA Click & Collect sites.
We are also expanding our 1-hour Click & Collect offer. Our business model integrates our store-based
and online offer by leveraging our stores to fulfil online orders.

Our online grocery business is profitable and has been consistently gaining market share within one of
the world's most developed online grocery markets. We have consistently outperformed the UK online
grocery market and increased our online market share in the last three years. According to Kantar, we
currently operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, holding 18.2% of
market share (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) as of December 2019, which
grew to 19.8% as of December 27, 2020 (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales),
representing a 1.5% gain and the second-strongest share gain since December 2019 amongst our key
competitors. The chart below shows the evolution of our market share as compared with our key
competitors for the periods presented. See also "Industry."

(Source: Kantar. Based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales for the year-to-date as of December 27,
2020 as compared to the 52-week periods through December 31 for 2017, 2018 and 2019.)

Our online business is already of significant scale: the chart below shows the growth of our online sales,
including a breakdown of online grocery versus George.com sales, for the periods presented.

(Source: ASDA information.)

According to Kantar, we are the second-largest online clothing retailer overall by volume in the United
Kingdom and we held 6.0% of the total UK online clothing (excluding essentials, footwear and accessories)
market by volume for the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020. Combined sales for our online grocery
business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion (of which £1.5
billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £1.9 billion in 2019
(of which £1.6 billion were online grocery sales and £0.3 billion were George.com sales) to a total of £2.7
billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 (of which £2.4 billion were online grocery sales and
£0.3 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR of 26% between 2018 and September 30,
2020. Additionally, our toyou service allows customers to conveniently collect and return orders from
George.com and other partner retailers at our stores. We have partnered with 119 brands and process
more than 10 million parcels per year.

With our team of approximately 140,000 flexible and engaged colleagues serving approximately 15
million customers each week (based on the average of weeks 39 to 42 of 2020), we are committed to and
deeply invested in the UK food supply chain.

Our business model is supported by diversification. First, we are a mass market retailer that serves the
entire UK population, in terms of both customer demographics and geography, with our customer base

skewing slightly towards value-seeking families, younger shoppers and lower-income customers who are
attracted by our Every Day Low Price strategy and with strong market shares in the North of England,
Scotland and Wales. For more information about our customer mix, see "—Our Customers," and for more
information about the geographic distribution of our stores, see "—Our Real Estate Portfolio." Second, we
believe we are well-positioned geographically, with a strong regional footprint across the United Kingdom.
Our store footprint is strongest in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Our large and diverse store
estate offers customers a variety of differentiated shopping formats. We operate 30 supercentres, 396
superstores, 155 supermarkets and 33 ASDA Living stores. For more information on our stores, see "—
_Our Store Formats."_

Subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, our 18 standalone PFSs and 305 co-located PFSs (including
both their underlying real estate assets and their business operations) will be sold to EG Group pursuant
to the Forecourt Business Disposal. However, to the extent we are required to do so in order to obtain
regulatory approval for the Acquisition, we will sell all or part of our forecourt business to third parties. In
addition, we will transfer to Propco 2 (or an affiliate) the real estate relating to the Warehouse Assets, and
to the extent required pursuant to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, the Select Retail Assets
and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets promptly following the CMA Clearance Date. We
will continue to operate the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the
Substitute Retail Assets pursuant to the ASDA Leases which will be put in place in accordance with the
terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. For more information, see "The Transactions—The
_Post Completion Disposals." This "Business" section, including historical statements herein, principally_
relates the ASDA's business as it will be following the completion of the Transactions.

Following the completion of the Acquisition, we will continue to benefit over the next three years from
support provided by Walmart, the world's largest retailer, through the Transitional Agreements. See
"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart" and "Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA_
_from Walmart." In addition to the Transitional Agreements, we have also agreed with Walmart to set up_
separation planning working groups to ensure a smooth transition. Our ongoing relationship with Walmart
is expected to bring a number of benefits, in particular:

## • Information and technology support to facilitate the change from the Walmart ecosystem;

 • Deep research and development expertise and capabilities;

 • Global sourcing, leveraging Walmart's sourcing capabilities in clothing and general merchandise;

 • Best practices, leveraging Walmart's expertise and experience as a leading global retailer; and

 • Long-term support and continued partnership with Walmart's management and leadership.

**KEY STRENGTHS**

We believe that we benefit from the following strengths, including being a business of significant scale
with a history of resilient performance, a differentiated operating model, a successful financial profile and
a significant asset backing, as further described below.

**_We are a business of significant scale with a history of resilient performance_**

_We operate in a large, historically stable, resilient and growing industry with favourable macroeconomic_
_tailwinds_

We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market, which has demonstrated
resilient performance underpinned by favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population,
consumer confidence and household spend on food and beverages. Since the 2007-2009 global financial
crisis, UK GDP growth has shown stable development: annual GDP growth has ranged between 1.3% and
2.9% between 2010 and 2019, according to ONS. In 2020, GDP growth in the United Kingdom is expected
to reflect a sharp decline due to the impact of COVID-19. However, it is predicted by ONS to quickly recover
to growth of approximately 5.5% in 2021 and, post-2021, UK GDP growth is expected to stabilise to an
average of 1.9% in subsequent years through 2025. The UK grocery retail market is also characterised by
favourable demographic characteristics, including a growing population. According to ONS, the UK
population is projected to grow from 67 million in 2019 to 70 million by 2031, which is expected to result in
an overall increase in the consumer base for groceries.

In addition to its historical stability, the UK grocery retail market is also resilient. Groceries are a
necessary and stable consumer expenditure, which generally allows the grocery retail market to weather

economic downturns better than certain other retail markets that involve more discretionary spending. For
example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history
during and following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The UK
grocery retail market peaked at 6.2% year-over-year growth in 2011, with a CAGR of 5.1% between 2007
and 2011, in each case according to Euromonitor. Additionally, during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis,
according to ONS, the percentage of average weekly household spend on food and non-alcoholic drinks
remained fairly consistent at approximately 11.0%, demonstrating the market's resilience during periods of
macroeconomic difficulty. According to ONS, this percentage has remained relatively flat following the
2007-2009 global financial crisis and the 2011 sovereign debt crisis, averaging 10.6% between 2012 and
2019, which we believe underscores the largely non-discretionary nature of grocery purchases. According
to Kantar, the UK grocery market's year-over-year growth increased to 12.3% (on a Total Grocery Absolute
Sales basis for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020), although growth in 2020 has been principally
driven by the impact of COVID-19 (mainly consisting of an increase in the consumption of food and drink
products at home during lockdowns), rather than long-term underlying growth drivers.

_We are the United Kingdom's third-largest grocer, holding sizeable market share_

According to Kantar, we are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom, with 12.2% of
market share and the second-largest grocery retailer in the North of England, Scotland and Wales (based
on Total Grocery Absolute Sales over 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020), with revenue of approximately
£19.6 billion and £20.0 billion (excluding petrol) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the 12 months
ended September 30, 2020, respectively. We have a network of 614 stores (excluding standalone PFSs)
throughout the United Kingdom, with a particular focus on superstores, supermarket and online formats.
We are also the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom by value (in terms of Total
Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar) and have been
growing faster than our competitors except for Sainsbury's in this channel, having increased our market
share over many years and particularly throughout 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we
believe that we are well-positioned as a large and established business with a clear set of peers.

We also believe that our multi-format, omni-channel offer positions us well to compete effectively and
to continue growing our market share. Despite not operating convenience formats, our Adjusted EBITDA
in the year ended December 31, 2019 was £1.2 billion (including petrol), which we believe indicates that
we have headroom for growth in the convenience market. We also cater to a broad target demographic,
which we believe provides us a long-term competitive advantage. In contrast to discounters, we provide a
broad range of branded as well as own-brand offers, while also having a more developed and established
online platform.

**_We believe we have faced the greatest impacts of discounters on our market_**

The adverse impact of discounters (primarily Aldi and Lidl) on the traditional grocers in recent years has
been significant but, while we believe that discounters will continue to put pressure on the market, we
believe that we have already faced the greatest impacts of this competition in the markets in which we
operate and that the discounters pose a greater challenge to other traditional grocers, who we believe are
more geographically exposed to the areas where discounters are likely to focus in the near-term.

As compared to our traditional grocer peers, our geographical concentration in the North of England,
Scotland and Wales, as evidenced by our number two market shares in those regions. The discounters
have already penetrated these areas and we expect the discounters to shift the focus of their expansion to
the South of England, the East of England and London, where we operate fewer sites as compared to the
Midlands, the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Furthermore, the catchment areas of 76% of our
stores already contain both major discounters, Aldi and Lidl, which is a higher percentage than any of our
traditional grocer competitors (the boundary used is a 10-minute drive-time radius around each point, which
is consistent regardless of location type or size of store and stores are only included in the count where
there is both Aldi and Lidl stores present within the drive-time boundary). Therefore, we believe that our
current performance already factors in the adverse impact of discounters to a large extent.

**_We have demonstrated resilience through downturns_**

Just as our market has proven resilient in times of economic difficulty and uncertainty, our business has
also proven resilient during recent economic and market downturns, including during the 2007-2009 global
financial crisis, as well as through a more recent period of low food inflation in the United Kingdom and the
rise of discounters in the UK grocery retail market in more recent years, particularly during 2014 to 2016.
During the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, we continued to perform well, achieving an average like-forlike sales (excluding petrol) growth rate of 6.1% for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009.

### 28


-----

Our EBITDA margins have also remained stable, ranging from 5.1% to 6.6% between 2007 and 2019.
During this same period, we also experienced stable revenue growth, at a CAGR of 2.5%.

**_We have performed well and have benefitted from an improved reputation through COVID-19_**

Despite the significant social and economic shifts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, our business has
experienced strong overall performance, particularly in our online and supermarket formats. While large
stores did not perform as well as smaller formats during the first UK lockdown, they have remained
instrumental in supporting the growth of our online retail grocery business, with online grocery orders being
largely fulfilled from our stores. We also believe that the "one-stop stop" offer of our stores appeals to
customers seeking to leave their homes and fulfil multiple missions efficiently. Overall, our food business
has performed relatively consistently throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an initial increase in
sales due to panic buying and customers stocking-up on key staples at the outset of each of the first three
lockdown periods. Following an initial decline at the beginning of the first lockdown, our general
merchandise business has also generally performed well throughout these lockdown periods, due to
increasing purchases of homeware products. While our clothing business was initially negatively impacted
during the early stage of the first UK lockdown period, we have recently experienced improved performance
in this business in line with an overall improvement of the general economy and a rebound in consumer
confidence. Finally, we have also taken steps throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance our
reputation with our stakeholders through various initiatives, including meal donations, priority delivery
services to care homes and additional leave provided to staff affected by COVID-19, which we believe
have had an overall positive impact on perceptions of our brand and business.

**_We benefit from a differentiated operating model_**

_We operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, which is profitable and_
_winning market share_

The United Kingdom has one of the most developed online grocery retail markets in the world, with one
of the highest rates of the population using the internet. There has been a significant shift in the grocery
retail market away from brick-and-mortar stores to online purchasing as demographic trends, greater
mobile and device usage, improved service proposition and technological advances in applications and
customer interfaces have driven increasing penetration rates in the online grocery retail market. We believe
we are poised to take advantage of these favourable consumer trends, as we have already established
ourselves in the rapidly growing UK online grocery retail market and our store and warehouse footprint is
strategically positioned across attractive geographic areas to service the growing demand for groceries
online.

According to Kantar, we are the second-largest online grocery retail platform in the United Kingdom,
holding 19.8% of market share (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) for the 52-week period ended
December 27, 2020. Relative to our competitors, we have posted the second-strongest share gain since
December 2019 and through the COVID-19 pandemic, with an industry-leading 3.3% increase in our share
of the online grocery retail market between December 2017 and December 2020 and an increase of 154
basis points between December 2019 and December 2020, according to Kantar (based on Total Grocery
Absolute Sales for the 52-week periods through December 31 for 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the 52-week
period ended December 27, 2020).

As a result of our significant gain in online market share, our online sales, combined sales for our online
grocery business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion (of
which £1.5 billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £1.9 billion
in 2019 (of which £1.6 billion were online grocery sales and £0.3 billion were George.com sales) to a total
of £2.7 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 (of which £2.4 billion were online grocery sales
and £0.3 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR of 26% between 2018 and September 30,
2020.

We believe there is greater scope for our online profitability to improve further. We expect that the
demand for online groceries will continue to be strong as customers increasingly adopt online shopping as
a more permanent and preferred way to purchase groceries following the initial lockdowns.

_We benefit from vertically integrated procurement through IPL_

We believe that we have a competitive advantage in food sourcing via our captive sourcing arm, IPL,
which enables us to take a vertically integrated approach to procurement. We believe that IPL provides us
with valuable sourcing differentiation as compared to our competitors. IPL is the largest importer of produce
in the United Kingdom and, while IPL is a group company, it is also our largest supplier. The aim of our
vertically integrated procurement model is to consolidate import activity for key products and reduce our

### 29


-----

overall costs. In 2019, we purchased £1.5 billion of our products through IPL. The foundation of IPL's costprice advantage is that it eliminates the "middle man" who typically serves as the intermediary in the supply
chain, thereby giving us greater control of costs, quality and supply of a diverse range of products. We
have an extensive IPL footprint across the United Kingdom, with ten processing facilities across the country
and more than 4,200 colleagues. Our IPL product mix is diversified according to our needs, with a mix of
61% in produce, 27% in protein, 9% in beverages and 3% in grocery in 2019. Additionally, we have been
able to build upon and benefit from our supplier relationships to deliver supply chain continuity and make
progress in our sustainability agenda. We also believe that IPL will provide greater stability and allow us
greater control over our supply chain now that the United Kingdom has left the European Union's single
market and customs union.

_The George Clothing and George Home offers are profitable and well-established_

We launched our clothing offer, George, in 1990 and it is the second-largest clothing brand in the
United Kingdom by volume of units sold (excluding essentials, footwear and accessories) for the 52 weeks
ended December 13, 2020 and is the leading UK childrenswear brand with 21% market share by volume
of units sold as of December 13, 2020, in each case according to Kantar. Despite challenges to this product
category overall, our online clothing sales have increased from £104.3 million for the year to December
31, 2016 to £308.6 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, with more than two-thirds of all
sales now made via mobile devices. We believe this demonstrates our strength in the online segment,
which is a key part of our operating model. Additionally, we have expanded the George branded offer to
include general merchandise. The George Home brand generated approximately £530 million in sales and
contributed approximately 38% of our total general merchandising sales for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2019. Sales by the George Home brand grew at a CAGR of approximately 3% between the
years ended December 31, 2016 and 2019. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product
categories generally have higher margins than our food product categories.

_We have well-developed own-brands_

We believe that our own-brand offers have been a key strength of our business and continue to offer
growth opportunities. We have an extensive own-brand product range in our food business, with
approximately 7,000 own-brand SKUs, while our premium "Extra Special" offer is our fastest growing ownbrand product line. Our award-winning approach to range development and innovation enables us to meet
changing customer needs: we launched approximately 850 new lines in 2020 and approximately 2,500
lines having been reformulated in 2020. In addition to our diverse and extensive product offer with our ownbrand range, we have also been able to drive growth through service and price positioning. We leverage
our IPL sourcing model to deliver value, especially in our produce, cooked meats and wine segments.

_We are driven by our commitment to Every Day Low Prices_

We believe our commitment to Every Day Low Prices is a significant competitive advantage as we aim
to lead on price while staying competitive on assortment. We believe that we are the least-expensive fullselection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal ASDA data, our prices are
approximately 6% to 7.5% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on a 2020 year-to-date
(weeks 1-42) average, based on total goods price gap percentage). Our low prices are supported by
rigorous cost control and a commitment to Every Day Low Prices, which enables us to control expenses
so that we can pass cost savings on to our customers.

**_We have achieved a successful financial profile_**

We have achieved a successful financial profile that is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA
margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure) and cash conversion
(defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. In 2018 and 2019, our average
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.5% (including petrol), our cumulative free cash flow was approximately
£1.7 billion and our average cash conversion was approximately 70%. This strong financial performance
is driven by our Every Day Low Price model, diverse product offer, strong own-brand grocery offer and
well-established George-branded product categories. Our Adjusted EBITDA margins have benefitted from
our cost transformation programmes, which have generated SG&A cost savings without compromising the
low prices we offer our customers. Our active working capital management has resulted in approximately
£400 million of improvements over the past three years. Furthermore, we have pursued a disciplined
approach to our capital expenditure over time, with the aim of maintaining and improving our real estate
platform. Our well-invested store real estate portfolio underpins our strong, ongoing cash flow generation.

### 30


-----

**_We are supported by a significant asset portfolio_**

We are supported by a well-invested and geographically diversified store estate, with 71% of our retail
sites being freehold (calculated as gross square footage of freehold stores as a percentage of gross square
footage of total stores, as of December 20, 2020; freehold percentage also includes certain properties that
are freehold with a partial leasehold or which are leasehold properties for which the leases have been
classed as long leasehold for the purposes of this calculation as those leases have nil or a peppercorn
ground rent). Subject to the facts, assumptions and qualifications set out in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing
and summarised in "Brokers' Opinions of Pricing." We believe we currently have a greater freehold
percentage than all but one of our traditional grocery competitors.

As shown in the charts below, our business is also unencumbered by significant unfunded pension
liabilities, following the bulk annuity insurance buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme, with no further
contributions anticipated. We do not anticipate significant future pension contributions and this will help us
to continue delivering quality cash conversion.

**BUSINESS STRATEGY**

Our primary strategy is designed to "win on price" by narrowing our price gap with discounters (such as
Aldi and Lidl) while providing good value and maintaining our price leadership position against our
traditional grocery peers, which we expect to further enhance customer loyalty. We aim to provide a
consistent, trusted experience, incentivising customers not to shop elsewhere, through the creation of
attractive store propositions and partnerships that increase our appeal to customers. We serve our
customers with our team of flexible and engaged colleagues, while increasing the number of self-serve
opportunities and transforming the in-store experience. We focus our growth where customers care,
expanding our addressable markets in online grocery, wholesale and community convenience.

**_Winning on price with value equivalent to the discounters_**

We are already well established as the lowest-price full-selection retailer in the United Kingdom and we
comfortably lead the traditional grocers in terms of lowest price. Moving forward, we intend to narrow our
price gap to the discounters and further expand our existing price gap with other traditional grocers. We
aim to achieve this by simplifying our core customer proposition to offer a curated range in food, general
merchandise and clothing that responds to customers' demonstrated willingness to shop a tighter range of
offers in-store. We will also create a more hassle-free customer experience in-store with our digital
transformation. For example, we intend to implement more customer self-serve options, such as moving
to a checkout model which features 80/20 self-checkout solutions and we plan to optimise our in-store

### 31


-----

fulfilment operations. We believe this will enable us to deliver a simplified operating model and end-to-end
supply chain efficiencies to drive further investment in value for the customer at the shelf edge, driving
greater traffic and therefore sales growth, which will in turn stimulate greater volume, thereby creating a
positive effect for our overall business.

We are assessing our approach to further reward customer loyalty by exploring non-traditional and
digitally-based loyalty mechanisms so that we can identify more customers in more transactions. We
believe that this approach will allow us to grow our customer analytics platform to bring better, faster, and
deeper customer insights to our largest investment decisions and to improve the overall customer
experience by personalising our offer.

**_Develop ASDA as a platform by forming relevant partnerships_**

We aim to grow ASDA as a platform through simplification of the store proposition by forming
partnerships that enable us to provide a broader set of relevant branded products and services, while also
building upon our existing capabilities, such as logistics and our customer-facing toyou proposition. We
believe adding partners to our platform will result in the creation of appealing "one-stop-shop" store
destinations for more customer missions. We are attracting relevant partners with our existing customer
base and scale, particularly with respect to the George brand clothing and general merchandise offers. For
example, our own-brand general merchandise proposition, led by the George Home brand, will become
more omni-channel focused as we grow those categories in which we believe we already have a strong
position and can maintain or gain leading market share. Meanwhile, in other categories, we will extend
product ranges with partners who specialise in those categories, have a strong affinity fit with our existing
customers and bring complementary expertise and reputation, such as in toys with The Entertainer. We
believe these partnerships will not only provide additional income through rent and revenue share models,
but will also create a positive effect on our overall business.

**_Growth where customers care, expanding our addressable market_**

We have grown our online grocery channel ahead of the market in 2020, having achieved 80% yearover-year growth as compared to the 66% year-over-year growth (in terms of value) achieved by the overall
UK online grocery market, according to Kantar (based on the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020).
However, we believe there is further headroom for growth based on continued channel shifting, demand
and customer "stickiness." We plan to continue to drive growth and market share gains in the online
channel through the acceleration of our online grocery channel's capacity to meet increased demand. We
continue to seek to optimise our online grocery operating model and further develop our already profitable
economic model through the ongoing assessment of our online product range and promotions, further
monetisation of our e-commerce assets, as well as other initiatives.

In addition to growing our core online grocery business, we are targeting further growth by expanding
the reach of our online platform and expanding our delivery services. We expect to provide customers with
greater and more convenient access to our product range by accelerating our last-mile delivery capabilities
via partnerships: for example, we have recently expanded our partnership with UberEats to over 100 of
our stores, with a further 100 planned in early 2021.

We believe that customers seeing ASDA in new locations and new formats will help us broaden our
customer base, thereby benefitting our core proposition (which is composed of our in-store and online food
and non-food offerings, and does not include trials, such as the ASDA On the Move wholesale-convenience
concept). We also believe that we can further expand our addressable market by accessing wholesale and
community convenience channels in an asset-light manner. We are looking to extend the reach of our
products delivered through wholesale and more specifically through partnerships that would provide
wholesale delivery services by using the logistics and distribution capabilities of IPL. We aim to broaden
our reach to existing and new customers through further convenience channel trials, using our established
partnerships to access the convenience channel within local communities. For example, ASDA On the
Move is our first entrance into the convenience market, where we are carrying out an initial trial with the
EG Group at three store locations in Ashby, Leamore and Primley. ASDA On the Move is a wholesale
arrangement whereby ASDA's own brand products as well as branded products will be sold in third-partyowned smaller convenience store formats.

**HISTORY**

Headquartered in Leeds, we are an omni-channel retailer across England, Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. We have built our business on listening to our diverse range of customers, offering what
they need at the best value and bringing innovation to the UK market.

### 32


-----

We were founded in 1965 through the merger of the Asquith family grocery business with the Associated
Dairies company in Yorkshire. Our name is derived from this historic merger, combining "Asquith" and
"Dairies" to form "ASDA."

Founded in the North of England, we have a rich history, heritage and culture. The Asquith family has
deep ties to the grocery business, W.R. Asquith having run a butchers shop in Knottingly, West Yorkshire,
which eventually expanded to seven shops. W.R. Asquith's sons, Peter and Fred, went on to create the
United Kingdom's first self-service supermarket in Castleford, introducing food discounting to the UK
grocery market, and eventually co-founded ASDA. In parallel to the growth of the Asquith family business,
a group of West Riding dairy farmers joined forces, eventually becoming Associated Dairies & Farm Stores
Limited led by Arthur Stockdale. Arthur's son, Sir Noel Stockdale, went on to co-found ASDA with Peter
and Fred Asquith.

In 1965, we acquired GEM, a major U.S. discount retailer operating in the United Kingdom. With the
addition of general merchandise to the former GEM stores, we introduced the superstore to the UK market,
a landmark event in the development of UK retailing. To complement this offer, Peter Asquith also
introduced the first discounted petrol filling station.

By 1970, we operated over 30 stores and were poised to expand beyond our original home in the North
of England. Throughout the 1970s, we grew our presence in the South of England, opening stores in
Newport, Plymouth and Gosport. In 1977, we launched our "ASDA Price" TV adverts, featuring the "pocket
tap" which came to be the official sign language for ASDA. By the end of the 1970s, we were operating
over 80 stores and opened our 100th store in 1981.

Throughout the 1980s, we focused on expanding our distribution capabilities, opening seven new
distribution centres strategically located throughout the United Kingdom by 1985. In 1987, our flagship
Watford store opened, another landmark in UK retailing, and featured the longest-ever checkout bank at
the time, with 45 checkouts. In 1988, we opened our headquarters in Leeds, with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher overseeing the opening ceremonies. In 1989, George Davies was asked to produce a line of
clothing for us that was high-quality, high-value and had its own identity: the pioneering George brand was
born.

In the 1990s, we developed the ASDA Way of Working, an innovative framework for a new
organisational structure that focuses on our stores and promotes colleague involvement, which set the
stage for the ASDA culture of today. In 1996, we opened our first ASDA Pharmacy location in Harrogate,
North Yorkshire and launched our "Tickled Pink" campaign to raise money for the fight against breast
cancer, a partnership that continues to this day. In 1998, we began our online retail operations with a
dedicated depot in Croydon.

In 1999, we joined the Walmart family, becoming part of the world's largest retailer. Throughout the
early 2000s, we continued to grow and innovate, expanding our online and Click & Collect offers, opening
our first ASDA Living store and our first Eco Store, winning awards for the value we offer customers as
well as for the positive environment we create for colleagues, launching our Free From and Extra Special
offers, launching standalone PFSs as well as ASDA Opticians. In 2015, we celebrated our 50th birthday
and George's 25th birthday. In 2016, Roger Burnley joined our team as Chief Operating Officer and Deputy
Chief Executive and was promoted in 2018 to President and CEO. ASDA has continued to roll out
innovations, including the United Kingdom's first parcel tower, which allows customers to collect online
orders in less than 60 seconds, and voice-activated shopping through Google Home.

Our values are rooted in service to our customers, respect for the individual, striving for excellence and
acting with integrity. We pursue our values with the support of our colleagues, culture and technology.

**The Transactions**

In this Offering Memorandum, references to the "Transactions" are to the (i) Acquisition and our
performance of all obligations contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, (ii) Financing and (iii) PostCompletion Transactions, collectively, (with each of (i) through (iii) and any subcomponent thereof or other
transaction or intermediate step reasonably necessary to consummate any of the foregoing, a
"Transaction").

**_The Acquisition and Acquisition Agreement_**

On October 2, 2020, the Issa Brothers and TDR Capital (the "Shareholders") caused their jointly
controlled entity, Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited (the "Purchaser"), to enter into the Acquisition
Agreement with the Seller, a subsidiary of Walmart, pursuant to which the Purchaser committed to acquire
all of the issued ordinary shares of the Company on the Acquisition Completion Date (the "Acquisition").
The Purchaser, a limited company formed under the laws of Jersey, is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary

### 33


-----

of the Issuers. It was formed by the Shareholders solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement and has not commenced any operations, other than as set
forth in the Acquisition Agreement.

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the consideration payable by the Purchaser on the Acquisition
Completion Date will be £6,614.0 million (assuming an Acquisition Completion Date of February 16, 2021)
(the "Purchase Consideration"). Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Seller was required
to use commercially reasonable endeavours to cause the Company to make distributions to the Seller or
other Walmart Group Companies of at least £1,769.5 million prior to the Acquisition Completion Date. On
December 21, 2020, the Company approved a distribution of £1,769.5 million to ASDA Holdings UK
Limited, of which £1,269.5 million was a distribution in specie through the transfer of intercompany
receivables and £500.0 million was settled in cash. On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Company will
settle outstanding intercompany payables due by the ASDA Group to Walmart Group Companies in cash.

The Acquisition Agreement includes customary warranties by the Seller and the Purchaser. The Seller
and the Purchaser have also separately agreed on a dedicated indemnification regime applicable to any
losses arising from the Equal Value Claims. As contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition
will be completed following receipt of the FCA's approval, but during the pendency of the review of the
Acquisition by the CMA, which is the competition authority that has the authority to review the Acquisition
following referral by the European Commission. The CMA's review is ongoing. Currently, the CMA is
conducting its phase 1 inquiry into the Acquisition. If the CMA identifies competition-related concerns over
the course of this phase 1 inquiry, we intend to propose remedies to address these concerns, which may
include the sale of certain PFS sites to unaffiliated third parties. See "—The Post-Completion
_Transactions—Forecourt Disposals." However, there can be no assurance that any remedies we may_
propose will be acceptable to the CMA. If the remedies we may propose are rejected, the CMA Clearance
Date could be significantly delayed and more extensive remedies may be required from us, which could
potentially include a mandated sale of the ASDA Group. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the
_Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact_
_recoveries under the Notes."_

In connection with the CMA's review of the Acquisition, we expect the CMA to issue an IEO shortly
before or immediately after Completion, which we expect to remain in force until the CMA Clearance Date.
Under this IEO, the Bellis Group will not be permitted to exercise de facto control over the ASDA Group or
otherwise direct its operations until the CMA Clearance Date. As a result, although we acquired the ASDA
Group on the Acquisition Completion Date, we will not effectively control the ASDA Group until the CMA
Clearance Date. Furthermore, while the IEO is in effect, it will prevent us from making any significant
structural or organisational changes to the ASDA Group, including the Forecourt Business Disposal, the
Excluded Forecourt Divestments or any other Post-Completion Transactions, unless we seek and obtain
a derogation from the CMA. Accordingly, we do not intend to initiate these post-completion transactions
until the CMA Clearance Date.

**_The Financing_**

_The Financing in the event that the Acquisition Completion Date occurs prior to the Issue Date_

We expect to settle the Offering after the consummation of the Acquisition. In this case, we expect to
fund our payment of the Purchase Consideration on the Acquisition Completion Date using the Equity
Contribution (including Walmart's Rollover Equity Investment) and amounts drawn under the Senior
Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the Senior Bridge Facility and the Senior Secured Bridge
Facilities (the "Initial Financing") and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. On the Issue Date,
we will then use the proceeds from the Offering to repay a portion of the Initial Financing, including all
amounts drawn under the Senior Bridge Facility and the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities (together with
the Initial Financing and the other related transactions described in this section of the Offering
Memorandum, the "Financing"). See "Use of Proceeds."

_Utilisations of Senior Bridge Facility_

On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Notes Issuer expects to draw the full amount of the
Senior Bridge Facility under the Senior Bridge Facility Agreement and to on-lend the amounts received to
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan. See "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements."_

### 34


-----

_Utilisations of Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge_
_Facility_

On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer expects to draw the full amount
of the Term Loan Facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and
the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will on-lend the net proceeds from
these drawings along with funds received from the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Financing
Proceeds Loan to the Purchaser, to be used as described in "Use of Proceeds." See "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements."_

_Utilisation of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility_

On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower expects
to draw £950 million under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, which will be on-lent by way of
the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Proceeds Loan to Midco 2. Midco 2 and its subsidiaries, in
turn, will on-lend the net proceeds of the drawing to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to a deeply
subordinated instrument, to be used as described in "Use of Proceeds." See "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility." To secure the Distribution Asset_
Disposal Bridge Facility, certain entities within the ASDA Group will grant first priority mortgages, fixed
charges or standard securities, as applicable, over the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and,
to the extent required thereunder, certain Substitute Retail Assets, as well as first-ranking pledges on the
Designated Bank Accounts. Prior to the execution of these mortgages, fixed charges, standard securities
and pledges, as applicable, entities within the ASDA Group are expected to enter into lease agreements
in respect of the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute
Retail Assets on substantially the terms summarised in "Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions―ASDA Leases."_

_The Equity Contribution_

In connection with the Acquisition, the Shareholders and Walmart will cause Bellis TopCo Limited and
its subsidiaries to contribute to the equity of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or on-lend to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to deeply subordinated instruments approximately £1,280 million in
aggregate (the "Equity Contribution"), which includes the proceeds of Walmart's £500 million Rollover
Equity Investment and £780 million of funds raised by the Shareholders.

_The Offering and the repayment of the bridge loans_

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering of the Senior Notes
to repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Bridge Facility Agreement, and the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering of the Senior Secured Notes to repay all amounts
outstanding under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities Agreement. See "Use of Proceeds."

_Estimated cash and cash equivalents as of the Acquisition Completion Date_

On or about the Acquisition Completion Date, ASDA will settle in cash intercompany loans owed to
Walmart of £409.0 million. In addition, on December 3, 2020, the Company announced that it will pay in
full its business rates for the UK tax year ending April 5, 2021 to the UK government (and the devolved
administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), thus waiving the relief it had received earlier in
2020 in respect of such payment as part of the UK government's measures in support of UK businesses
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is estimated to be within a range of £320 million to £340
million. As a result, the Company expects to pay £254 million in retrospective business rates for the period
from April to December 2020, to be funded from cash available on the Company's balance sheet. The
Company expects to engage in due course with the competent UK authorities to discuss and agree the
exact terms of such payment, including its timing. ASDA also plans to resume its regular payments of the
business rates on a monthly basis commencing with the month of January 2021. The Company estimates
that its average cash and cash equivalents from January 4 to February 2, 2021 (inclusive), as adjusted to
give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions on the Acquisition Completion Date and
excluding the amount earmarked to retrospectively pay business rates tax relief accepted from the UK
government for the period to December 31, 2020 was £505.6 million. ASDA's net working capital for the
month of January tends to be slightly lower than the yearly average due to the customary seasonal dip in
stock levels and the build-up of trade payables to suppliers in the early part of each financial year following
the Christmas trading period. ASDA's actual cash and cash equivalents available as of the Acquisition
Completion Date may however be different.

_The Financing in the event that the Issue Date occurs prior to, or substantially concurrently with, the_
_Acquisition Completion Date_

It is possible that the Acquisition Completion Date may be delayed until after the Issue Date, including
due to the timing of our receipt of the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. In this case, unless the Offering is
settled substantially concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, we will, pending completion of the
Acquisition, fund the gross proceeds of the Offering into Escrow Accounts, which will be held in the name
of the relevant Issuer, but controlled by the relevant Escrow Agent, and pledged in favour of the relevant
Trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of the holders of the relevant Notes, pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreements and Escrow Account Charges dated on or before the Issue Date. Under the terms of
the Escrow Agreements, release of the Escrowed Proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition and the solvency of the relevant Issuer. Following
release from escrow, we expect to use the proceeds of the Offering, together with the Equity Contribution
and amounts drawn under the Senior Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and the Distribution
Asset Disposal Bridge Facility (as described above and in "Use of Proceeds.") to fund our payment of the
Purchase Consideration on the Acquisition Completion Date. In the event we deposit the gross proceeds
of the Offering into the Escrow Accounts on the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date has not
occurred, or the conditions to the release of such Escrowed Proceeds have not been satisfied, on or before
the Outside Date, Midco has not elected to extend the initial Shortfall Agreement Termination Date (or any
extension thereof) and the Release has not occurred as at such date or in certain other circumstances,
subject to certain conditions, the Notes will be mandatorily redeemable at a price equal to 100% of the
aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to, but not
including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date and Additional Amounts, if any.

If the Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, we will forgo
these escrow procedures and will instead retain the proceeds of the Offering to fund part of the
consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement on the Acquisition Completion Date. See "Use of
_Proceeds," "Description of the Senior Notes—Acquisition Agreement, Timing of Completion Date and Issue_
_Date; Escrow of Proceeds" and "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Acquisition Agreement, Timing_
_of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds."_

**_The Post-Completion Transactions_**

_Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility_

Following the CMA Clearance Date, ASDA will transfer the Warehouse Assets, the balances credited
to the Designated Bank Accounts, and to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility, Substitute Retail Assets and Select Retail Assets, to Propco 2 or other affiliates who are
obligors thereunder (the "Post-Completion Disposals") in exchange for consideration left outstanding
(the "Post-Completion Disposal Receivables"). Alternatively, Select Retail Assets and, as relevant,
Substitute Retail Assets may remain held by the ASDA Group but will continue to be charged in favour of
the lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility as described in the paragraph below.
ASDA will agree to subordinate its claims against Propco 2 or such other affiliates to those of lenders under
the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility pursuant to a separate subordination agreement. The
transfers of each of the Warehouse Assets and, to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility, Substitute Retail Assets and Select Retail Assets in connection with the PostCompletion Disposals will be subject to the ASDA Leases, which will remain in effect. To the extent any
part of a Substitute Retail Asset or a Select Retail Asset comprises a Forecourt Asset, following the CMA
Clearance Date, if documents are agreed by such date, that part of the ASDA Lease which comprises the
Forecourt Asset will be surrendered (or, as applicable, renounced) and any security affecting that part of
the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be released
such that the intention is for the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset to be transferred to
Propco 2 or its affiliates (to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility) to exclude the title to the Forecourt Asset which will be retained by ASDA by way of a Forecourt
Assets Separation. If any relevant Substitute Retail Asset or Select Retail Asset remains held by the ASDA
Group at the time of the Forecourt Business Disposal, that part of the ASDA Lease which comprises the
Forecourt Asset will be surrendered (or, as applicable, renounced) and any security affecting that part of
the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be released
and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will permit the disposal of the Forecourt Asset pursuant
to the terms of the Forecourt SPA by way of a Forecourt Assets Separation such that the remaining part
of the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset excludes the title to that Forecourt Asset. After the
Forecourt Business Disposal has been completed, (to the extent the Post-Completion Disposals were
made to Propco 2, rather than to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, following the
CMA Clearance Date) we expect Midco 2 to transfer Bellis Select Warehouse Holdings Limited ("Propco

outstanding balance of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Proceeds Loan. Please see
"Summary Corporate and Financing Structure."

Because certain third-party consents, approvals or certifications in relation to the grant of an ASDA
Lease, the grant of Third-Party Asset Security in respect of one or more Warehouse Assets or, in each
case, the registration of any such ASDA Lease or grant of Third-Party Asset Security may remain
outstanding at a cut-off point prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, entities in the ASDA Group owning
such Warehouse Assets may not be able to grant an ASDA Lease or grant Third-Party Asset Security in
respect of such Warehouse Assets at the relevant time. In this case, on or about the Acquisition Completion
Date, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into ASDA Leases in respect of one of more Substitute Retail
Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the aggregate value of the Affected Warehouse
Assets and grant Third-Party Asset Security over such Substitute Retail Assets to secure the obligations
of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility. In the event that the Land Registry (or jurisdictional equivalent) will not register any Third-Party
Asset Security because a deed of covenant is not in the prescribed form due to changes required by the
security agent under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility or third-party authorisations are
outstanding (in each case in respect of a Warehouse Asset), then an ASDA Lease will be granted instead
in respect of a Substitute Retail Asset of approximately equivalent value and Third-Party Security will be
granted over such Substitute Retail Asset. See "The Transactions—Post-Completion Transactions—
_Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility." If,_
prior to the CMA Clearance Date, outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications are received
to permit the grant of an ASDA Lease, the grant of Third-Party Asset Security or the registration of either
of the following (as the case may be) in respect of any Affected Warehouse Asset, entities in the ASDA
Group will enter into an ASDA Lease in respect of such Affected Warehouse Asset (to the extent not
already entered into) and grant Third-Party Asset Security over such Affected Warehouse Asset (to the
extent not already granted) to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility
Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. Third-Party Asset Security which was
granted on or about the Acquisition Completion Date over one or more Substitute Retail Assets with an
aggregate value approximately equal to the value of that Affected Warehouse Asset will then be released
and discharged, subject to the Third-Party Asset Security in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset
being successfully registered at the Land Registry (or its jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of lenders under
the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.

If, following the CMA Clearance Date, requisite third-party consents, approvals or certifications in
relation to the transfer of one or more Warehouse Assets (in respect of which either an ASDA Lease and
Third-Party Asset Security have been granted or an ASDA Lease has been granted and requisite thirdparty consents, approvals or certifications in relation to the grant of any first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed
charges or, as applicable, standard securities to be granted by Propco 2 or other affiliates (and the
registration of the foregoing) have been obtained) pursuant to the Post-Completion Disposals or the
registration of any transfer in respect of such Warehouse Assets remain outstanding, entities in the ASDA
Group will enter into ASDA Leases in respect of one of more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate
value approximately equal to the aggregate value of such Affected Warehouse Assets. Entities in the ASDA
Group that own such Substitute Retail Assets will grant Third-Party Asset Security in respect of such
Substitute Retail Assets. To the extent required by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, such
Substitute Retail Assets will be transferred to Propco 2 or other affiliates pursuant to the Post-Completion
Disposals to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. Alternatively, such assets may remain held by the ASDA Group
but continue to be charged in favour of the lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. If,
following the date of the Post-Completion Disposals, outstanding third-party consents, approvals or
certifications are received to permit the grant of an ASDA Lease, the transfer to and the grant of firstranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities (to the extent that Affected
Warehouse Asset is not transferred subject to existing Third-Party Asset Security) by Propco 2 or other
affiliates in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into an ASDA
Lease in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset (to the extent not already entered into) and transfer the
Affected Warehouse Asset to Propco 2 or other affiliates, which will grant (unless the Affected Warehouse
Asset is transferred subject to existing Third-Party Asset Security) a first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed
charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of it to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. First-ranking legal
mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities which were granted over one or more
Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the value of that Affected
Warehouse Asset will then be released and discharged, subject to the first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed

charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset being successfully
registered at the Land Registry (or its jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of lenders under the Distribution
Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. See "The Transactions—Post-Completion Transactions—Warehouse and
_Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility."_

If outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications are received following the CMA
Clearance Date to permit the grant of an ASDA Lease and the transfer of an Affected Warehouse Asset to
Propco 2 or other affiliates, but not the grant of a first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable,
standard security in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset to secure the obligations of the Distribution
Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, such Affected
Warehouse Asset may nevertheless be transferred to Propco 2 or other affiliates. If, following such transfer,
outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications are received to permit the grant of first-ranking
legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities by Propco 2 or other affiliates, and
the registration of the foregoing in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset, Propco 2 or other affiliates
will grant a first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of them
to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution
Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. First-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard
securities which were granted over one or more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value
approximately equal to the value of that Affected Warehouse Asset will then be released and discharged,
subject to the first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of
that Affected Warehouse Asset being successfully registered at the Land Registry (or its jurisdictional
equivalent) in favour of lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.

If following the transfer of a Warehouse Asset, Select Retail Asset and/or Substitute Retail Asset to
Propco 2 or other affiliates, the ASDA Lease granted in respect of such asset is not held by ASL, the
relevant tenant is required under the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement to
assign the ASDA Lease to ASL with the intent that all ASDA Leases in respect of Warehouse Assets,
Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets held by Propco 2 or other affiliates are held by ASL.

If, following the transfer of a Substitute Retail Asset to Propco 2 or other affiliates, first-ranking legal
mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities which were granted over that Substitute
Retail Asset are released, Propco 2 or other affiliates may transfer such Substitute Retail Asset to the
ASDA Group in advance of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility being repaid in full.

The initial term of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is one year from the Acquisition
Completion Date, with the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower retaining an option to extend
it for a further six months at its own discretion. The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has no
scheduled amortisation and we intend to repay it in full ahead of maturity primarily with the net proceeds
from the Warehouse Sale Transactions we expect to consummate before and after the transfer of Bellis
Select Warehouse Holdings Limited to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, which
would have to be applied promptly in mandatory prepayment of the facility. Depending on market conditions
and expected transaction values, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower or Propco 2, as
applicable, may also sell some or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, some or all
of the Substitute Retail Assets (in each case subject to ASDA Leases), the proceeds of which would also
have to be applied in mandatory prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. We
anticipate that the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower (or Propco 2, as may be the case)
will return to the Issuers, by way of contribution to their equity, in-kind loan pursuant to a deeply
subordinated instrument or repayment of Post-Completion Disposal Receivables held by the Group, any
Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets that it does not sell to repay the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility, and, to the extent such proceeds are not used to repay amounts outstanding
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, amounts equal to any net proceeds directly or
indirectly received from the sale of any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets (including any
Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds) (the "Retail Assets Contributions"). After the Retail Assets Contributions
have been made, we expect to distribute any remaining Post-Completion Disposal Receivables to Topco,
in the amounts that remain outstanding at the time, by way of dividends in kind and anticipate that Topco
would then arrange for such receivables to be extinguished by contribution to Propco 2. Subject to certain
limitations, the Post-Completion Disposals and the in-kind distribution of the Post-Completion Receivables
will be permitted by the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement notwithstanding the restrictive
covenants or other terms that would otherwise apply to such transactions. Moreover, these distributions
will not constitute Restricted Payments under the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement and will
not reduce the Issuers' capacity to make distributions or pay dividends in the future. See "Description of
_the Senior Secured Notes—General—Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries; Extraction of_

_Warehouse Assets and Select Retail Assets" and "Description of the Senior Notes—General—Restricted_
_Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries; Extraction of Warehouse Assets and Select Retail Assets."_

In connection with sale transactions entered into by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility
Borrower, we may be required to amend the terms of the ASDA Leases. Such amendments will be
permitted under the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement, subject to compliance with the
covenants described in "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Affiliate Transactions" and "Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate_
_Transactions."_

_Forecourt Disposals_

On February 3, 2021, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and Bellis Forecourts Limited entered into the
Forecourt SPA, whereby the Senior Secured Notes Issuer undertook to sell to Bellis Forecourts Limited
the share capital of Acquisition 2 or any other member of the Bellis Group or a member of the ASDA Group
that holds the Forecourt Business, directly or indirectly, following the Acquisition Completion Date, the
CMA Clearance Date and completion of the acquisition by Acquisition 2 (or such other company) of the
Forecourt Business. Pursuant to a separate agreement, the EG Forecourt SPA, entered into on or about
the same date, Property Newco agreed to sell to Euro Garages Limited the share capital of Holdco (owning
in turn Bellis Forecourts Limited and therefore the Forecourt Business) promptly upon closing under the
Forecourt SPA. Property Newco may assign such separate agreement to the shareholders (i.e., Optima
Group S.à r.l. and Able Holdings Limited), who may sell Property Newco itself, rather than Holdco or one
of its subsidiaries. In preparation for, and prior to, the closing of the Forecourt SPA, we expect that ASDA
will distribute the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as soon as practicable following the CMA Clearance
Date. In order to effect the distribution of the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as a dividend in kind,
ASDA will have to arrange for the separation of the freehold or leasehold title to its co-located forecourts
(comprising the vast majority of the Forecourt Assets) from the parent title currently comprising adjacent
store or retail assets or sites by way of a Forecourt Assets Separation and the entities within the ASDA
Group that currently hold non-co-located Forecourt Assets will need to distribute such assets to Acquisition
2. We expect that the process of effecting these title separations and distributions to take several months
following the Acquisition Completion Date.

The headline enterprise value established under the Forecourt SPA, subject to customary working
capital adjustments, is £750 million, less the aggregate value of any Excluded Forecourts (and of any other
assets relating to the Excluded Forecourts). The consideration will be left outstanding at the closing of the
Forecourt SPA (the "Forecourt Disposal Receivable") and we expect it to be ultimately settled in cash
and in full promptly following the closing of the EG Forecourt SPA. See "Certain Relationships and Related
_Party Transactions—Forecourt SPA." The parties may decide to novate and assign the Forecourt SPA to_
another member of the Bellis Group or a member of the ASDA Group (as seller) and to a member of the
EG Group (as buyer), in which case the separate agreement between Property Newco and Euro Garages
Limited would be terminated and the Forecourt Business (or a holding company thereof) would be sold
directly to EG Group by the ASDA Group.

The IEO that is expected to be issued by the CMA will not permit us to sell any Forecourt Assets
pursuant to the Forecourt SPA for so long as the IEO remains in force. Consequently, we do not expect to
consummate the Forecourt Business Disposal before the CMA Clearance Date. The Forecourt SPA
requires us to complete the transactions contemplated thereunder as soon as reasonably practicable
following the satisfaction of the conditions precedent stipulated in its terms, which include the IEO to be
issued by the CMA ceasing to be in effect.

The CMA's investigation of the Acquisition is ongoing, and we may be required to take remedial action
to address any competition-related concerns the CMA may identify. If remedies prove necessary, we may
be required to designate certain Forecourt Assets (along with certain related assets) as Excluded
Forecourts and sell them to unaffiliated third parties (the "Excluded Forecourt Divestments"). Although
we will attempt to carry out the Excluded Forecourt Divestments by way of orderly sales following a
competitive sales process, there can be no assurance that the market conditions or circumstances of the
Excluded Forecourt Divestments will permit such an outcome, and the price we receive for any Excluded
Forecourts sold through the Excluded Forecourt Divestments may be less than what we would have
ultimately received in a fully voluntary sale. In addition, third parties may have rights over the Forecourt
Assets (including rights to acquire and pre-emption rights) exercisable in the event of a transfer of the
Forecourt Assets (whether of the freehold or leasehold interest or of whole or part). In all such cases, the
transfer of those Forecourt Assets may be significantly delayed, prevented in part or prevented entirely.
See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties
_and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes."_

Under the terms of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the proceeds from the sale of both the
Forecourt Business Disposal and the Excluded Forecourt Divestment must be used to repay amounts
outstanding under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility until it has been repaid in full. See "Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility."_

**Sources and Uses for the Transactions**

**Use of proceeds in the event that the Acquisition Completion Date occurs prior to the Issue Date**

On the Acquisition Completion Date, we will fund our payment of the Purchase Consideration and pay
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions (including estimated fees and
expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering) using the Equity Contribution (including Walmart's
Rollover Equity Investment) and amounts drawn under the Senior Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge
Facility, the Senior Bridge Facility, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility. On the Issue Date, we will then use the proceeds from the Offering to repay amounts drawn
under the Senior Bridge Facility and Senior Secured Bridge Facilities.

The sources and uses of cash related to the drawing of the Senior Bridge Facility, the Senior Secured
Bridge Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility
and the making of the Equity Contribution are shown in the table below as of the Acquisition Completion
Date. The table below should be read in conjunction with "Capitalisation."

Rollover Equity Investment and £780 million of funds procured by the Shareholders. The Senior Notes Issuer will in turn
contribute funds from the Equity Contribution to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on or about the Acquisition Completion Date.

(4) On the Acquisition Completion Date, Bellis Noncore 2 Limited will draw the full £950 million amount made available under the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, the net proceeds of which will be on-lent by way of the Distribution Asset Disposal

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be £2,750 million. If the Offering is
consummated prior to, and not substantially concurrently with, the Acquisition Completion Date, pending
consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit, on the Issue Date, an amount in cash
equal to the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Accounts, which will be held in the name of the
relevant Issuer, but controlled by the relevant Escrow Agent, and pledged in favour of the relevant Trustee
on behalf of and for the benefit of the holders of the relevant Notes, pursuant to the terms of the relevant
Escrow Agreement. Upon release from the Escrow Accounts on or about the Acquisition Completion Date,
the gross proceeds from the Offering, the Equity Contribution (including Walmart's Rollover Equity
Investment) and amounts drawn under the Senior Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the
Senior Bridge Facility, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility will be used to (i) pay the consideration and make other payments owing to Walmart under the
Acquisition Agreement and (ii) pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions
(including estimated fees and expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering). If the Offering
closes substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, and we will retain the proceeds of
the Offering and apply them on the Acquisition Completion Date as described above and shown in the table
below. The sources and uses of cash related to the Offering, the drawing of the Senior Facilities, the

**The Shareholders**

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

**COVID-19 Update**

Structural shifts due to COVID-19 have led to increased overall growth in the grocery retail market.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, customer behaviour has changed, with a shift away from out-of-home
food consumption towards at-home food consumption, to the benefit of the UK grocery market. The chart
below shows COVID-19-accelerated channel shifts over the periods presented. For further information on
prevailing trends in the UK grocery retail market and, in particular, the recent channel shifts which have
been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, please see "Industry."

(Source: Kantar Worldpanel, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a year-to-date basis ended December 27, 2020.)

Grocery sales have grown by 12.3% between December 1, 2019 and December 27, 2020, according
to Kantar, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales. Changes to consumer behaviour that have positively
benefitted the grocery market during the COVID-19 pandemic include: increased consumption of food at
home, a shift to online shopping channels, increased preference for shopping locally, in particular during
the first UK lockdown (which we believe benefitted retail groups with a strong convenience store presence),
and an increased focus on food safety, hygiene and health.

Despite significant challenges posed by COVID-19, our business has remained resilient, supported by
a well-developed online channel, which saw significant growth during government-imposed lockdowns as
customer behaviour evolved. We were able to quickly increase the capacity of our online offer in response
to increased demand driven by the pandemic, gaining market share and improving the profitability of our
online business.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have benefitted from healthy revenue growth driven by higher food
sales volumes (which were in turn driven by stockpiling and increased customer demand for in-home
groceries via the online grocery channel), while margins contracted due to adverse changes in sales and
product mix resulting from decreases in clothing sales, which impacted the George Clothing brand, the
temporary closure of 33 ASDA Living stores and the shift in product mix within the food category away
from higher-margin categories, such as food-to-go, and towards lower-margin categories, such as beer,
wine and spirits and meat, which factors were partially offset by lower levels of promotional activity and
stronger general merchandise sales. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product
categories generally have higher margins than our food product categories. Profitability was also adversely
impacted by COVID-19-related increases in operating costs, such as the increase in retail colleague wage
costs (driven by bonus payments, overtime wages and wages paid colleagues absent from work due to
COVID-19, as well as wages paid to colleagues who worked during such sick colleagues' absences, rather
than as a result of increased wage rates), increased costs incurred in connection with goodwill
compensation paid to clothing suppliers, holiday markdowns, enhanced cleaning and related health and
safety measures, as well as higher retail operating expenditures.

We have considered the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event: the
impact on future results and cash flows is difficult to estimate and we have therefore considered a range
of scenarios as described in note 1 ("Accounting Policies") of the 2019 Financial Statements. See "Risk

_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—The_
_impact of COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to create_
_uncertainty in our market and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations_
_for the foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control."_

We took significant steps during the first twelve weeks of the first lockdown period in the spring of 2020
to protect our most vulnerable colleagues, asking them to remain home on contracted pay in order to
ensure their safety, while we increased social-distancing and protective measures at our stores. When we
welcomed these colleagues back, we carried out individual risk assessments and conducted socialdistancing training for them. In September 2020, we further tightened our safety measures across our
stores to provide an enhanced level of protection to our customers and colleagues, introducing new door
marshals at the front of stores and increasing security presence in the aisles of larger stores; marshals
also provide sanitised baskets to customers as they enter stores. Colleagues continue to be on hand to
help customers with safety queries and reiterate government guidelines to wear a face covering and
maintain social distancing while they shop. Customers who do not have a face covering when they enter
the store are offered a pack of disposable masks that they can pay for as they complete their shopping.
Additional hand sanitisation stations are in place in the busiest sections of all stores in addition to the
multiple cleaning points already found throughout stores.

Should current safety guidelines continue, we believe that it is unlikely that we will continue to incur a
significant portion of the additional costs in the future that we incurred in responding to the COVID-19
pandemic during the first two lockdowns, as many of these costs incurred were one-off in nature. The chart
below shows the COVID-19 impacts for ASDA on a year-to-date basis as of September 30,
2020.

In March 2020, as part of a number of measures to support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic,
the UK government, the Scottish government and the devolved administrations for Wales and Northern
Ireland announced full relief for rates charges applicable to certain eligible commercial properties for the
rates year beginning in April 2020 (and in the case of Northern Ireland, such support ended after July
2020). This relief applied to a number of properties owned or leased by the Group and as such, no rates
charge has been recognised in these accounts for the period to which this relief applied. On December 3,
2020, we publicly announced that we would voluntarily pay business rates for the April 2020/21 year on
the properties to which the relief applied. As rates relief was in place at September 30, 2020, no liability
existed at that date and as such, our directors have concluded that the announcement on December 3,
2020 is a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event per the guidance set out in IAS 10. Discussions with the
relevant local authorities relating to the timing of payment are ongoing.

**_Current Trading_**

_The unaudited preliminary financial results presented below are derived from the Company's unaudited_
_management accounts. This information has not been audited or reviewed, nor have any procedures been_
_performed by the Company's independent auditors with respect thereto, and it has not been prepared with_
_a view towards compliance with IFRS. Accordingly, you should not place undue reliance on it, and no_
_opinion or any other form of assurance is provided with respect thereto. The Company's unaudited_
_preliminary financial results are based upon a number of assumptions and judgments that are subject to_
_inherent uncertainties and are subject to change, and are not intended to be a comprehensive statement_
_of the Company's financial or operational results for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020. Although_
_the Company believes the management estimates and unaudited preliminary financial information and the_
_assumptions on which they are based to be reasonable, the Company's actual results as of and for the 12-_
_month period ending December 31, 2020 to be published in the coming months may vary from the_
_information contained above and such variations could be material._

Based on preliminary, unaudited management accounts of ASDA, like-for-like sales growth (excluding
petrol) for the eight weeks through December 24, 2020 was 6.9%, as compared to the same dates in 2019.
We expect that EBITDA for ASDA for the year to December 31, 2020 will be in line with internal
expectations, adjusted for the charges relating to business rates which arise from our announcement on
December 3, 2020 to forgo COVID-19 business rates relief.

**SUMMARY CORPORATE AND FINANCING STRUCTURE**
_The following chart illustrates the Group's expected simplified corporate structure and principal_
_indebtedness on the Issue Date after giving effect to the Offering and the use of the proceeds therefrom._
_For a summary of the debt obligations referred to in this chart, see "Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements," "Description of the Senior Secured Notes" and "Description of the Senior Notes."_

(1) Funds managed by TDR Capital LLP beneficially own 50.0% of the ordinary shares in Bellis TopCo Limited ("Topco") and
Property Newco through a holding company, Optima Group S.à r.l., and Mohsin Issa CBE and Zuber Vali Issa CBE each
beneficially own 25.0% of the ordinary shares of each of Topco and Property Newco indirectly through their holding company,
Able Holdings Limited. For additional information regarding our ultimate shareholders, see "Principal Shareholders."
(2) On the Acquisition Completion Date, Walmart, through its wholly owned subsidiary Global Pinnacle Corporation, will make
a £500 million Rollover Equity Investment in senior shares and a special participation share issued by Bellis TopCo 2 Limited
("Topco 2"), which constituted a portion of the £1,280 million Equity Contribution that was used to pay the Purchase
Consideration for the Acquisition. See "The Transactions" and "Principal Shareholders." The Rollover Equity Investment will
be made on a cashless roll-over basis.
(3) On the Acquisition Completion Date, Bellis Noncore 2 Limited (the "Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility
**Borrower") will draw the full £950 million amount made available under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, the**
net proceeds of which will be on-lent by way of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Proceeds Loan to Bellis Midco
2 Limited ("Midco 2"). See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility."
Midco 2 and its subsidiaries, in turn, will on-lend such net proceeds to the Issuers through deeply subordinated instruments.


-----

On or about the Acquisition Completion Date, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into the ASDA Leases in respect of the
Warehouse and Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets. Following the execution of
the ASDA Leases, entities in the ASDA Group owning the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent
applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets will grant first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard
securities by way of third-party security over such assets, to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility (the "Third-Party Asset Security"). Certain thirdparty consents, approvals or certifications may remain outstanding in relation to the grant of an ASDA Lease or the grant of
Third-Party Asset Security in respect of one or more Affected Warehouse Assets or, in each case, the registration of any
such ASDA Lease or Third-Party Asset Security. As a result, the entities in the ASDA Group owning the Affected Warehouse
Assets may not be able to grant or register an ASDA Lease or grant or register Third-Party Asset Security in respect of such
Affected Warehouse Assets on the Acquisition Completion Date. If not, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into ASDA
Leases in respect of one of more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the aggregate
value of the Affected Warehouse Assets and will grant Third-Party Asset Security over each of the relevant Substitute Retail
Assets to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility. See "The Transactions—The Post-Completion Transactions—Warehouse and Other Select Retail
_Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility."_
In addition to the Third-Party Asset Security, each entity in the ASDA Group owning Warehouse Assets (or, to the extent
applicable, certain Substitute Retail Assets), subject to an ASDA Lease will grant third-party security over its Designated
Bank Accounts into which the rental income derived from the ASDA Leases in respect of the Warehouse Assets or Substitute
Retail Assets is to be paid, to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. The security interests created by the security over the Designated Bank Accounts
and the Third-Party Asset Security exclusively benefit the creditors and other secured parties under the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes, and the Notes Guarantees in respect
thereof, will be effectively subordinated to indebtedness under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility to the extent
of the value of the Warehouse Assets and the Select Retail Assets (and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the Substitute
Retail Assets depending on the value of any Affected Warehouse Assets) and of the value of the monies standing to the
credit of each Designated Bank Account.
(4) Topco 2 and Property Newco are shareholders of Bellis Holdco Limited ("Holdco"). Topco 2's shareholding consists entirely
of class A shares, and Property Newco's shareholding consists entirely of class B shares.
(5) We are offering £500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes.
If we settle the Offering after the Acquisition Completion Date, we will draw the Term Loan Facilities, Senior Bridge Facility,
Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility to fund a portion of the consideration payable for
the Acquisition on the Acquisition Completion Date and will repay a portion of the drawings under the Senior Bridge Facility
with the proceeds of the Senior Notes on the Issue Date.
If the Acquisition Completion Date is delayed until after the Issue Date, unless the Offering is consummated substantially
concurrently with the Acquisition, we will fund the gross proceeds of the Senior Notes into an Escrow Account, which will be
held in the name of the Senior Notes Issuer, but controlled by the relevant Escrow Agent, and pledged in favour of the Senior
Notes Trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes, pursuant to the terms of the relevant
Escrow Agreement and Escrow Account Charge dated on or before the Issue Date. In that case, on or about the Acquisition
Completion Date, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Escrowed Proceeds will be released from escrow and
utilised to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement.
If the Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, we will forgo the escrow procedures
and will instead retain the proceeds of the Senior Notes to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition
Agreement on the Acquisition Completion Date. See "Use of Proceeds" and "Description of the Senior Notes—Acquisition
_Agreement, Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds."_
On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be general senior obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer. Subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, on the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date the Senior Notes will be guaranteed
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, ASDA Group Limited and ASL (the "Initial ASDA Guarantors") on a senior
subordinated basis as set forth under "Description of the Senior Notes—General—Notes Guarantees" and will be secured
by the Senior Notes Collateral (including the Shared Security) on the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion
Date as set forth under "Description of the Senior Notes—Security." The Shared Security will also secure the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer's obligations in respect of its Senior Notes Guarantees on a second-priority basis. Subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed within 90 days of the Acquisition Completion Date, by McLagan
Investments Limited and The Burwood House Group Limited (the "Post-Completion Guarantors" and, together with the
Initial ASDA Guarantors, the "ASDA Guarantors," and, together with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the "Senior Notes
**Guarantors"). The Notes Guarantees in respect of the Senior Notes provided by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the**
ASDA Guarantors (the "Senior Notes Guarantees") will be subordinated to their obligations in respect of the Senior Secured
Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and any future indebtedness incurred in
accordance with the Indentures, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement and the
Intercreditor Agreement that is pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes or the Notes Guarantees in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes (the "Senior Secured Notes Guarantees").
(6) On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will on-lend the proceeds of the Senior Bridge Facility or the
Senior Notes, as applicable, to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan, and the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer will then transfer these funds to the Purchaser by way of back-to-back equity contributions or
intercompany loans through the intermediate subsidiaries to pay a portion of the Purchase Consideration on the Acquisition
Completion Date.
(7) We are offering £2,250 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes. If we settle the Offering after the
Acquisition Completion Date, we will draw the Term Loan Facilities, Senior Bridge Facility, Senior Secured Bridge Facilities
and Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility to fund a portion of the consideration payable for the Acquisition on the Acquisition
Completion Date and will repay the drawings under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and part of the drawings under the
Senior Bridge Facility and Facility B with the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date.
If the Acquisition Completion Date is delayed until after the Issue Date, unless the Offering is consummated substantially
concurrently with the Acquisition, we will fund the gross proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes into an Escrow Account,
which will be held in the name of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, but controlled by the relevant Escrow Agent, and pledged
in favour of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes,
pursuant to the terms of the relevant Escrow Agreement and Escrow Account Charge dated on or before the Issue Date. In
that case, on or about the Acquisition Completion Date, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Escrowed

-----

Proceeds will be released from escrow and utilised to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition
Agreement.
If the Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, we will forgo the escrow procedures
and will instead retain the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes to fund part of the consideration payable under the
Acquisition Agreement on the Acquisition Completion Date. See "Use of Proceeds" and "Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Acquisition Agreement, Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds."_
On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be general senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Subject
to the Agreed Security Principles, on the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured
Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Initial ASDA Guarantors and will be secured by the Senior Secured Notes
Initial Collateral as set forth under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security." The Senior Secured Notes Initial
Collateral will also secure the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement (including the Revolving Credit Facilities)
and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility on an equal and ratable basis with the Senior Secured Notes. Within 90 days of
the Acquisition Completion Date or, in the case of security over the ASDA Guarantors' Material Real Property, 180 days,
the Senior Secured Notes will also be secured by the Senior Secured Notes Post-Completion Collateral. Additionally, the
Senior Secured Notes Collateral may also secure, on an equal and ratable, or in certain circumstances super senior, basis
with the Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred and
secured on the Collateral in the future. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement."
Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis within 90 days of
the Acquisition Completion Date by the Post-Completion Guarantors.
(8) The Senior Facilities Agreement will initially provide for committed facilities of up to £2,275 million (equivalent), comprised
of the £1,585 million Term Loan Facilities and the £690 million Revolving Credit Facilities. If we settle the Offering after the
Acquisition Completion Date, a portion of the initial drawings under Facility B under the Senior Facilities Agreement will be
repaid with the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Facilities Agreement is expected to be amended and
restated either prior to or shortly following the Acquisition Completion Date to make certain changes, including making
Facility B an all euro-denominated facility (the "Amended SFA"). The initial borrower under the Senior Facilities Agreement
is the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and, on the Acquisition Completion Date, the Company and ASDA Stores Limited will
each accede to the Senior Facilities Agreement as an additional guarantor and, in the case of ASDA Stores Limited, as an
additional borrower. On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Term Loan Facilities made available pursuant to the Senior
Facilities Agreement will be utilised in full by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the proceeds thereof contributed to the
Purchaser by way of back-to-back equity contributions or intercompany loans through intermediate subsidiaries. Subject to
certain limitations, other subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, including the other ASDA Guarantors, may become
borrowers under the Senior Facilities Agreement in the future. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior
_Facilities Agreement" and "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement." Subject to_
compliance with the terms of the Indentures, the commitments made available under the Senior Facilities Agreement may
be increased in the future.
(9) On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will draw £750 million under the Forecourt Disposal
Bridge Facility and will transfer these funds to Acquisition 2 by way of equity contribution. Acquisition 2 will then contribute
these funds to the Purchaser's equity, and the Purchaser will use these funds to pay a portion of the Purchase Consideration
on the Acquisition Completion Date. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Forecourt Disposal Bridge
_Facility."_
(10) On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Purchaser will fund the payment of the Purchase Consideration with amounts
indirectly received from the Equity Contribution and drawings under the Term Loan Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge
Facility and the Senior Bridge Facility and Senior Bridge Facilities or, if the Issue Date occurs prior to or substantially
concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, the proceeds of the Offering. See "Use of Proceeds." Upon
consummation of the Acquisition, the Company will become a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Purchaser. Following
completion of the Acquisition, our ability to direct the business of and exercise de facto control over the Company and its
subsidiaries will be subject to the terms of the CMA's initial enforcement order (the "IEO") until the CMA Clearance Date.
Moreover, the CMA may require the Shareholders to take certain actions to address competition-related concerns, including
divestment of certain PFS sites. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain
_uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes."_
(11) On the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and the Initial ASDA Guarantors and the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed by the Initial ASDA
Guarantors. Within 90 days of the Acquisition Completion Date, the Post-Completion Guarantors will be required to provide
Notes Guarantees in respect of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes as described in "Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—General—Notes Guarantees" and "Description of the Senior Notes—General—Notes Guarantees,"_
respectively. As of October 20, 2020, the ASDA Guarantors held title to sites representing 99.9% of the aggregate capital
pricing of the ASDA Store and Office Portfolio, as described in "Brokers' Opinions of Pricing." For the nine month period
ended September 30, 2020, the ASDA Guarantors represented 99.9% of the ASDA Group's consolidated revenue. Each
Guarantee will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including the Agreed Security Principles, and certain
contractual and legal limitations. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement" and
"Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the
_Security Interests." By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less_
than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee.

### The following chart illustrates the Group's expected simplified corporate structure and principal indebtedness after giving pro forma effect to the Post-Completion Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom, following the CMA Clearance Date. For a summary of the debt obligations referred to in this chart, see "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements," "Description of the Senior Secured Notes" and "Description of the Senior Notes."

_______________________________
(1) On February 3, 2021, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and Bellis Forecourts Limited entered into the Forecourt SPA, whereby
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer undertook to sell the share capital of Acquisition 2 or any other subsidiary holding the
Forecourt Business, directly or indirectly, to Bellis Forecourts Limited following the Acquisition Completion Date, the CMA
Clearance Date and the acquisition of the Forecourt Business by Acquisition 2 or such other subsidiary. Pursuant to a
separate agreement entered into on the same date, Property Newco agreed to sell to Euro Garages Limited (a member of
the EG Group) the share capital of Holdco (which will in turn own Acquisition 2 and therefore the Forecourt Business) or any
other entity holding, directly or indirectly, the Forecourt Business promptly upon closing under the Forecourt SPA. Property
Newco may assign such separate agreement to the shareholders (i.e., Optima Group S.à r.l. and Able Holdings Limited),
who may sell Property Newco itself, rather than Holdco or one of its subsidiaries. In preparation for, and prior to, closing
under the Forecourt SPA, we expect that ASDA will distribute the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as soon as practicable
following the CMA Clearance Date. In order to effect the distribution of the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as a dividend
in kind, ASDA will have to arrange for the separation of the freehold or leasehold title to its co-located forecourts (comprising
the vast majority of the Forecourt Assets) from the parent title currently comprising adjacent store or retail assets or sites.
The entities within the ASDA Group that currently hold Forecourt Assets will then distribute such assets to Acquisition 2. We

### 50


-----

expect the process of effecting these title separations and distributions to take several months following the Acquisition
Completion Date. The headline enterprise value established under the Forecourt SPA, subject to customary working capital
adjustments, is £750 million, less the aggregate value of the Excluded Forecourts (and of any other assets relating to the
Excluded Forecourts). The consideration will be left outstanding at the closing of the Forecourt SPA (the "Forecourt Disposal
**Receivable") and we expect it to be settled in cash and in full promptly following the closing of the subsequent sale of Holdco**
or Property Newco pursuant to the separate agreement between Property Newco and Euro Garages Limited. See "Certain
_Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Forecourt SPA."_
Following closing under the Forecourt SPA, assuming no novation and assignment thereof, Bellis Topco Sub Limited will
acquire Midco from Holdco. The consideration for the transfer from Holdco will be the cancellation of Topco 2's class A shares
in Holdco. In connection with this transfer, Bellis Topco Sub Limited will issue additional shares to Topco 2. Following this
reorganisation (i) Bellis Topco Sub Limited will become the direct parent of Midco and an indirect parent of Midco 2, the
Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Purchaser and the ASDA Group, (ii) Property Newco will be the
sole shareholder in Holdco and (iii) Holdco's only direct subsidiary will be Bellis Forecourts Limited, which will be the direct
parent of Acquisition 2. Holdco or Property Newco will then be acquired by EG Group and the Forecourt Disposal Receivable
will be settled in cash, with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer being required under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility
Agreement to use the proceeds of such payment to repay all or a portion of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility. As an
alternative to the foregoing steps, the parties may decide to novate and assign the Forecourt SPA to the Company or one of
its subsidiaries (as seller) and/or to a member of the EG Group (as buyer), in which case the separate agreement between
Property Newco and Euro Garages Limited would be terminated and the Forecourt Business (or a holding company thereof)
would be sold directly to EG Group by the ASDA Group. The proceeds of such sale would be applied following receipt by the
ASDA Group to repay all or a portion of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility. The transfer of the Forecourt Assets and the
implementation of the Forecourt Business Disposal entail certain risks, and there can be no assurance we will be able to
consummate these transactions as described herein or at all. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—We
_may not be able to consummate the Post-Completion Transactions as quickly as we anticipate, or at all, and the manner in_
_which we execute the Post-Completion Transactions may differ from what we present in this Offering Memorandum."_
(2) Following the CMA Clearance Date, ASDA will transfer the Warehouse Assets, the balances credited to the Designated Bank
Accounts, and, to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement, some or all
of the Substitute Retail Assets and Select Retail Assets, to Bellis Select Warehouse Limited ("Propco 2") or other affiliates
who are obligors thereunder (the "Post-Completion Disposals") in exchange for consideration left outstanding (the "Post**Completion Disposal Receivables"). Alternatively, Select Retail Assets and, as relevant, Substitute Retail Assets may**
remain held by the ASDA Group but will continue to be charged in favour of the lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility as described in the paragraph below. ASDA will agree to subordinate its claims against Propco 2 or such other
affiliates to those of lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility pursuant to a separate subordination
agreement. The transfers of each of the Warehouse Assets and, to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility, Substitute Retail Assets and Select Retail Assets in connection with the Post-Completion Disposals
will be subject to the ASDA Leases, which will remain in effect. To the extent any part of a Substitute Retail Asset or a Select
Retail Asset comprises a Forecourt Asset, following the CMA Clearance Date, if documents are agreed by such date, that
part of the ASDA Lease which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be surrendered (or, as applicable, renounced) and any
security affecting that part of the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset which comprises the Forecourt Asset will
be released, such that the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset will be transferred to Propco 2 or its affiliates (to
the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility) without title to the Forecourt Asset, which
will be retained by ASDA by way of a Forecourt Assets Separation. If any relevant Substitute Retail Asset or Select Retail
Asset remains held by the ASDA Group at the time of the Forecourt Business Disposal, that part of the ASDA Lease which
comprises the Forecourt Asset will be surrendered (or, as applicable, renounced) and any security affecting that part of the
Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be released and the Distribution
Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will permit the disposal of the Forecourt Asset pursuant to the terms of the Forecourt SPA by
way of a Forecourt Assets Separation such that the remaining part of the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset
excludes the title to that Forecourt Asset.
Because certain third-party consents, approvals or certifications in relation to the grant of an ASDA Lease, the grant of ThirdParty Asset Security in respect of one or more Warehouse Assets or, in each case, the registration of any such ASDA Lease
or grant of Third-Party Asset Security may remain outstanding prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, entities in the ASDA
Group owning such Warehouse Assets may not be able to grant an ASDA Lease or grant Third-Party Asset Security in
respect of such Warehouse Assets at the relevant time. Instead, on or about the Acquisition Completion Date, entities in the
ASDA Group may enter into ASDA Leases in respect of one of more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value
approximately equal to the aggregate value of the Affected Warehouse Assets and mortgage (or, as applicable, grant a
standard security
over) such Substitute Retail Assets to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under
the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. In the event that the Land Registry (or jurisdictional equivalent) will not register
any Third-Party Asset Security because a deed of covenant is not in the prescribed form due to changes required by the
security agent under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility or third-party authorisations are outstanding (in each case
in respect of a Warehouse Asset), then an ASDA Lease will be granted instead in respect of a Substitute Retail Asset of
approximately equivalent value and Third-Party Asset Security will be granted over such Substitute Retail Asset. See "The
_Transactions—Post-Completion Transactions—Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset_
_Disposal Bridge Facility." If, prior to the CMA Clearance Date, outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications_
are received to permit the grant of an ASDA Lease, the grant of Third-Party Asset Security or the registration of either of the
foregoing (as the case may be) in respect of any Affected Warehouse Asset, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into an
ASDA Lease in respect of such assets (to the extent not already entered into) and will enter into Third-Party Asset Security
(to the extent not already entered into) to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. Third-Party Asset Security which will be granted on or about the
Acquisition Completion Date over one or more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the
value of that Affected Warehouse Asset will then be released and discharged, subject to the Third-Party Asset Security in
respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset being successfully registered at the Land Registry (or its jurisdictional equivalent)
in favour of lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.
If, following the CMA Clearance Date, requisite third-party consents, approvals or certifications in relation to the transfer of
one or more Warehouse Assets (in respect of which either an ASDA Lease and Third-Party Asset Security have been granted
or an ASDA Lease has been granted and requisite third-party consents, approvals or certifications in relation to the grant of
any first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities to be granted by Propco 2 or other
affiliates (and the registration of the foregoing) have been obtained) pursuant to the Post-Completion Disposals or the

registration of a transfer in respect of such assets remain outstanding, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into ASDA Leases
in respect of one of more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the aggregate value of
such Affected Warehouse Assets. Entities in the ASDA Group that own such Substitute Retail Assets will grant Third-Party
Asset Security in respect of such Substitute Retail Assets. To the extent required by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility, such Substitute Retail Assets will be transferred to Propco 2 or other affiliates pursuant to the Post-Completion
Disposals. Alternatively, such assets may remain held by the ASDA Group but continue to be charged in favour of the lenders
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.
If, following the date of the Post-Completion Disposals, outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications are
received to permit the grant of an ASDA Lease, the transfer to and the grant of first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges
or, as applicable, standard securities (to the extent that Affected Warehouse Assets are not transferred subject to the existing
Third-Party Asset Security) by Propco 2 or other affiliates, and the registration of the foregoing in respect of such Affected
Warehouse Assets, the relevant entities in the ASDA Group will enter into an ASDA Lease in respect of the Affected
Warehouse Assets (to the extent not already granted) and transfer the Affected Warehouse Assets to Propco 2 or other
affiliates, which will grant (unless the Affected Warehouse Asset is transferred subject to existing Third-Party Asset Security)
a first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of it to secure the obligations of the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. First-ranking legal
mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities which were granted over one or more Substitute Retail Assets
with an aggregate value approximately equal to the value of the Affected Warehouse Assets will then be released and
discharged, subject to the first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of such
Affected Warehouse Assets being successfully registered at the Land Registry (or its jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of
lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. See "The Transactions—Post-Completion Transactions—
_Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility."_
If outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications are received following the CMA Clearance Date to permit the
grant of an ASDA Lease and the transfer of Affected Warehouse Assets to Propco 2 or other affiliates, but not the grant of a
first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of such Affected Warehouse Assets
to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility, such Affected Warehouse Assets may nevertheless be transferred to Propco 2 or other affiliates. If, following
such transfer, outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications are received to permit the grant of first-ranking
legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities by Propco 2 or other affiliates, and the registration of
the foregoing in respect of such Affected Warehouse Assets, Propco 2 or other affiliates will grant a first-ranking legal
mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of them to secure the obligations of the Distribution
Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. First-ranking legal mortgages,
fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities which were granted over one or more Substitute Retail Assets with an
aggregate value approximately equal to the value of such Affected Warehouse Asset will then be released and discharged,
subject to the first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of such Affected
Warehouse Asset being successfully registered at the Land Registry (or its jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of lenders under
the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.
If following the transfer of a Warehouse Asset, Select Retail Asset and/or Substitute Retail Asset to Propco 2 or other affiliates,
the ASDA Lease granted in respect of such asset is not held by ASL, the relevant tenant is required under the terms of the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement to assign the ASDA Lease to ASL with the intent that all ASDA Leases
in respect of Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets held by Propco 2 or other affiliates are
held by ASL.
If, following the transfer of a Substitute Retail Asset to Propco 2 or other affiliates, first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges
or, as applicable, standard securities which were granted over that Substitute Retail Asset are released, Propco 2 or other
affiliates may transfer such Substitute Retail Asset to the ASDA Group in advance of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility being repaid in full.
The initial term of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is one year from the Acquisition Completion Date, with the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower retaining an option to extend it for a further six months at its own
discretion. The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has no scheduled amortisation and we intend to repay it in full
ahead of maturity primarily with the net proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions, which would have to be applied
promptly in mandatory prepayment of the facility. We may consummate Warehouse Sale Transactions before or after the
transfer of Bellis Select Warehouse Holdings Limited to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower described in
footnote 3 below. Depending on market conditions and expected transaction values, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility Borrower or Propco 2, as applicable, may also sell some or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable,
some or all of the Substitute Retail Assets (in each case subject to ASDA Leases), the proceeds of which would also have to
be applied in mandatory prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. We anticipate that the Distribution
Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower (or Propco 2, as may be the case) will return to the Issuers, by way of contribution to
their equity, in-kind loan pursuant to a deeply subordinated instrument or repayment of Post-Completion Disposal
Receivables held by the Group, any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets that it does not sell to repay the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, and, to the extent such proceeds are not used to repay amounts outstanding
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, amounts equal to any net proceeds directly or indirectly received from
the sale of any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets (including any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds) (the "Retail
**Assets Contributions"). After the Retail Assets Contributions have been made, we expect to distribute any remaining Post-**
Completion Disposal Receivables to Topco, in the amounts that remain outstanding at the time, by way of dividends in kind,
and Topco to then arrange for such receivables to be extinguished by contribution to Propco 2.
In connection with sale transactions entered into by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, we may be
required to amend the terms of the ASDA Leases. Such amendments will be permitted under the Indentures and the Senior
Facilities Agreement, subject to compliance with the covenants described in "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions" and "Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—_
_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions."_
(3) After the Forecourt Business Disposal has been completed, we expect Midco 2 to transfer Bellis Select Warehouse Holdings
Limited (and, indirectly, Propco 2) to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, in repayment of amounts
outstanding under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Proceeds Loan.

in connection with the Acquisition, if the Acquisition
Completion Date occurs prior to the Issue Date.

If the Acquisition Completion Date is delayed until

satisfaction of certain conditions, the Escrowed
Proceeds will be released from escrow and utilised
to fund part of the consideration payable under the
Acquisition Agreement.

If the Offering is settled substantially concurrently
with the completion of the Acquisition, we will forgo
the escrow procedures and will instead retain the
proceeds of the Offering to fund part of the
consideration payable under the Acquisition
Agreement on the Acquisition Completion Date.

from such additional amounts) is not less than the
amounts which would have been received by such
holder in the absence of such withholding or
deduction.

**Tax redemption ...........................................** If certain changes in the law of any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction become effective that would impose
withholding taxes or other deductions on the
payments on the Notes and the relevant Issuer or
Guarantor is required to pay additional amounts, the
relevant Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole, but
not in part, at any time, at a redemption price of
100% of the principal amount thereof, together with
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed
for redemption and all additional amounts, if any.

**Change of Control ......................................** Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a
change of control the Issuers will be required to
make an offer to repurchase all outstanding Notes
at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal
amount thereof.

### 62

**Escrowed Proceeds; Special Mandatory** If the Offering settles after the Acquisition
**Redemption .................................................** Completion Date, we will draw committed credit
facilities to fund a portion of the consideration
payable for the Acquisition on the Acquisition
Completion Date and will repay part of those
drawings with the proceeds of the Offering on the
Issue Date.

If the Acquisition Completion Date is delayed until
after the Issue Date, including due to the timing of
our receipt of the FCA's approval of the Acquisition,
unless the Offering is settled substantially
concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, we
will, pending completion of the Acquisition, fund the
gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow
Accounts, which will be held in the name of the
relevant Issuer, but controlled by the relevant
Escrow Agent, and pledged in favour of the relevant
Trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of the
holders of the relevant series of Notes, pursuant to
the terms of the Escrow Agreements and the
Escrow Account Charges. The release of the
Escrowed Proceeds, if any, will be subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, including the
consummation of the Acquisition in accordance with
the terms of the Acquisition Agreement. Changes or
other modifications to the Escrow Agreements and
the Escrow Account Charges can be made either
with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the applicable series
of Notes then outstanding or without the consent of
the applicable Holders, if such changes or other
modifications will not, individually or when taken as
a whole, adversely affect the rights of any of the
applicable Holders in any material respect.

In the event we deposit the gross proceeds of the
Offering into the Escrow Accounts on the Issue Date
and the Acquisition Completion Date has not
occurred or the conditions to the release of such
Escrowed Proceeds have not otherwise been
satisfied, on or before April 30, 2022 (the Outside
Date) or in certain other circumstances (including at
the discretion of Midco, a holding company of the
Issuers, subject to certain conditions), the Notes will
be mandatorily redeemable at a price equal to 100%
of the aggregate issue price of the Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest from the Issued Date
to, but not including, the Special Mandatory
Redemption Date, and Additional Amounts, if any.

In the event of a special mandatory redemption,
Midco, a wholly owned subsidiary of Topco and a
holding company of the Issuers, will be required to
provide the Issuers with such funding as is
necessary for the Issuers to contribute to the Escrow
Accounts, up to the maximum aggregate amount of
£20.0 million pursuant to the terms of the Shortfall
Agreements, an amount in cash expected to equal
the sum of (i) interest accrued on the Notes from the
Issue Date, and (ii) any Additional Amounts, in each
case, to March 31, 2021 (unless such date has been
unilaterally extended by Midco in its sole discretion

### 63


-----

in accordance with the terms of the Shortfall
Agreements), which is the date by which we expect
to have received the FCA's approval of the
Acquisition. Midco's obligations under the Shortfall
Agreements will be guaranteed by a bank of
international standing, which will deliver to the
Issuers an irrevocable letter of credit or on-demand
guarantee initially expiring on March 31, 2021.

If the Offering is settled substantially concurrently
with the completion of the Acquisition, we will forgo
the escrow procedures and will instead retain the
proceeds of the Offering to fund part of the
consideration payable under the Acquisition
Agreement on the Acquisition Completion Date.

**Certain Covenants ......................................** The Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior
Notes Indenture will, among other things, restrict the
ability of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
Senior Notes Issuer, respectively, and their
respective restricted subsidiaries, to:

                      - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness and
issue certain preferred stock;

                     - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make
certain investments;

                       - make certain other restricted payments;

                          - create or permit to exist certain liens;

                        - impose restrictions on the ability of the relevant
Issuer's subsidiaries to pay dividends;

                          - transfer or sell certain assets;

                        - merge or consolidate with other entities;

                         - enter into certain transactions with affiliates; and

                         - impair the security interests created for the benefit
of the holders of the relevant Notes.

Certain of the covenants will be suspended if the
relevant Notes obtain and maintain an investmentgrade rating.

Each of the covenants in the Indentures will be
subject to significant exceptions and qualifications.
See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Covenants" and "Description of the Senior_
_Notes—Certain Covenants."_

**Transfer Restrictions .................................** The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not
been, and will not be, registered under the
Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction. The Notes are subject to restrictions on

**Original Issue Discount .............................** The Notes may be issued with original issue
discount ("OID") for U.S. federal income tax
purposes. In such event, U.S. holders (as defined
under "Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United
_States Federal Income Tax Considerations")_
generally will be required to include such OID in
gross income (as ordinary income) on an annual
basis under a constant yield accrual method
regardless of their regular method of accounting for
U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S.
holders generally will include any OID in income in
advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such
income. See "Certain Tax Considerations—Certain
_United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—_
_Original Issue Discount."_

**No Established Market for the Notes ........** The Notes will be new securities for which there is
currently no established trading market.
Accordingly, there is no assurance that an active
trading market will develop for the Notes.

**Listing ..........................................................** Application will be made to The International Stock
Exchange Authority Limited to list the Notes on the
Official List the Exchange and to admit the Notes for
trading on the Exchange.

Guarantees will be governed by the laws of the State
of New York.

The Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities

and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility
Agreement are governed by English law.

The security documents will be governed by the
applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the
relevant collateral is located.

**SUMMARY HISTORICAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER FINANCIAL**
**DATA**

_The historical consolidated financial information and other financial data of the Company as of and_
_for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have been extracted from the audited_
_consolidated financial statements of the Company included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum or_
_from the Company's accounting records. The unaudited condensed consolidated historical financial_
_information and other financial data of the Company as of and for the nine months ended September_
_30, 2019 and September 30, 2020 have been extracted from the unaudited condensed consolidated_
_interim financial statements of the Company included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum or from_
_the Company's accounting records._

_This Offering Memorandum includes unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended_
_September 30, 2020, which is calculated by adding the results of operations for the nine months ended_
_September 30, 2020 to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subtracting_
_the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The financial information for_
_the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that_
_may be expected for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 or any future period, and should not be_
_used as the basis for or prediction of an annualised calculation. The unaudited financial information for_
_the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not_
_required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles_
_and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only._

_Results of operations for prior periods or years are not necessarily indicative of the result to be_
_expected for any future period. Prospective investors should bear in mind that the performance_
_indicators and ratios that we report herein, such as the EBITDA Measures, Free Cash Flow, Cash_
_Conversion, capital expenditure and certain other measures are not financial measures defined in_
_accordance with IFRS and, as such, may be calculated by other companies using different_
_methodologies and having different results. Therefore, these performance indicators and ratios are not_
_directly comparable to similar figures and ratios reported by other companies. The following tables also_
_contain financial measures and ratios that are not presented in accordance with IFRS. For the definitions_
_and analytical limitations of these Non-IFRS Measures, see "Presentation of Financial and Other_
_Information." You should read the information summarised below in conjunction with the information_
_contained in "Presentation of Financial and Other Information," "Use of Proceeds," "Management's_
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and the consolidated_
_financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._

of IFRS 16 in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a decrease to operating costs of £31.4 million and an increase to
finance costs of £52.7 million compared with lease-related expenses charged in the prior year under IAS 17.

**Other Financial Data**

In assessing the performance of our business, we consider a variety of alternative performance measures and financial
measures. Such indicators are either purely operational in nature, include financial information not derived from our
accounting system and may include VAT which is collected by us at the cash registers or online checkout but turned over
to the competent tax authorities. See "Presentation of Financial and Other Information." The table below sets out certain
key performance indicators for the Company for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, the nine months ended
September 30, 2019 and 2020 and the 12 months ended September 30, 2020. Unless noted otherwise below, this data

(1) EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and _Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, capital expenditure, Free Cash Flow, Cash Conversion, Pro forma_ net debt and _Pro forma net senior_

(2) Including petrol. IFRS 16 was adopted on January 1, 2019. The modified retrospective approach was taken: prior year comparatives have not been restated. Adjusted
EBITDA and _Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 and for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 are based on EBITDA that is_
presented on an IFRS 16 basis. Adoption of IFRS 16 in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a decrease to operating costs of £31.4 million and an increase to
finance costs of £52.7 million compared with lease-related expenses charged in the prior year under IAS 17. Adoption of IFRS 16 is the primary reason for the increase
in lease interest of £52.7 million and increase in depreciation of assets held under leases of £149.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior
year: as these line items are added back to the calculation of EBITDA, this results in a higher EBITDA than if prepared under IAS 17, which would include operating
lease expense charges in EBITDA. The operating lease expense included in EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2018 is £188.3 million.

**_Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA ........._** **1,164.4**

(A) IFRS 16 was adopted on January 1, 2019. The modified retrospective approach was taken and prior year comparatives have not been
restated. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 and for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 is presented after giving effect to the adoption of IFRS 16. Adoption
of IFRS 16 in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a decrease in operating costs of £31.4 million and an increase in finance costs
of £52.7 million compared to lease-related expenses charged in the prior year under IAS 17. Adoption of IFRS 16 is the primary reason for
the increase in finance lease interest of £52.7 million and the increase in depreciation of assets held under finance leases of £149.5 million
in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The addition of these line items back into the calculation of EBITDA results
in a higher EBITDA than if EBITDA were prepared under IAS 17, which would include operating lease expense charges within EBITDA. The
operating lease expense included in EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2018 is £188.3 million.

(B)   The elimination of IFRS 16 impact adjustment deducts from EBITDA rental payments made during the period in respect of finance leases
that would have been accounted for as operating leases under IAS 17 prior to the entry into force of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019. Under IAS
17, our leases would be classified primarily as operating leases, with no assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and rental charges instead
of depreciation and interest in the income statement. Increases in rental charges of £133.8 million, £129.7 million and £177.9 million for the
nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2020, and the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, are
recognised through the foregoing adjustments within EBITDA. Additionally, below EBITDA adjustments decreasing depreciation and
amortisation by £107.7 million, £104.1 million and £143.6 million, and adjustments decreasing interest by £38.4 million, £37.6 million and
£51.3 million for the same respective periods have also been made.

(C)   The asset write-off adjustment relates to the non-cash write off of all tangible fixed assets with value written off in the normal course of
business, usually as a result of store or depot remodelling activities. 2019 also includes an additional write off for some work in progress on
an IT system project.

### 71


-----

(D) The prior year ATM rates adjustment reflects the removal of income that has been included in EBITDA following a change in the assessment
of business rates for automated teller machines (ATMs). In 2020, a retrospective change was made, as a result of which the Company was
entitled to a refund for business rates previously paid. This adjustment removes the income resulting from those refunds for periods earlier
than financial year 2020.

(E) The bonus top-up adjustment comprises discretionary retrospective enhancements to the annual bonus over and above the parameters of
the standard bonus structure.

(F) The contract implementation costs adjustment comprises one-off costs relating to the implementation of a new contract for retail colleagues
in 2019. In particular, these cost comprised (i) a one-off cost associated with estimated incremental costs as a result of the one-to-one
consultations with individual colleagues affected by the proposals, which required such colleagues to be absent from work on the retail shop
floor and replaced with incremental time from other colleagues, and (ii) a holiday pay top-up resulting from a transitional agreement made
with colleagues to top-up their holiday allowance for 2019 after the new colleague contract introduced in November 2019.

(G) The merger costs adjustment reflects an adjustment to remove the directly attributable one-off costs incurred as part of the proposed merger
between the Company and J Sainsbury's plc that was subsequently abandoned following CMA review. The adjustment reflects actual costs
incurred and management's judgement around which costs were directly attributable to the proposed merger. Costs include consultancy and
legal fees, as well as one-off retention bonuses paid to colleagues in connection with that transaction. The proposed merger was announced
in May 2018 and the CMA's review was completed in April 2019.

(H) The pension contribution adjustment comprises one-off transitional arrangement voluntarily made by the Company that included two annual
payments to colleagues' pension funds resulting from changes to the eligibility regime for such contributions.

(I) The transaction bonuses adjustment comprises £0.5 million accrued for one-off bonuses that will be paid to colleagues working on the
Acquisition. There are expected to be additional transactional bonuses accrued prior to completion.

(J) The restructuring adjustments comprise one-off provisions relating to severance costs in connection with the restructuring of home office
functions.

(K) The pension guarantee adjustment removes amounts paid to Walmart in connection with Walmart's guarantee of the ASDA defined benefit
pension scheme. This guarantee payment was terminated when the pension scheme buy-in was completed in October 2019. Therefore,
these charges will not continue on a going-forward basis.

(L) Options in Walmart shares have historically been awarded to employees of the Company; these share option awards have been accounted
for within EBITDA as cash settled equity awards. As no new awards of such options in Walmart shares will be granted and all existing options
in Walmart shares will be settled within six months following the Separation, the corresponding charges will fall away and, as a result, are
added back for the relevant periods (for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, £96.3 million, for the nine months ended September 30,
2019 and 2020, £116.7 million and £83.7 million, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, £44.6 million and
£129.3 million, respectively). On a going-forward basis, the Company will, however, enhance other colleague incentive programmes. The
estimated annual incremental cost of these enhanced incentive programmes is estimated to be £38 million. Therefore, a charge of £38.0
million has been included for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 as well as the years ended December, 31 2018 and 2019. A prorated charge of £28.5 million has been included for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020. This adjustment thus reflects the
net amount remaining following the removal of the Walmart shares options and the incremental cost of the enhanced colleague incentive
programmes.

(M)   The Walmart royalties adjustment reflects the removal of royalties paid by the Company to Walmart as part of an advance pricing agreement
calculated using a transfer pricing methodology whereby the amount payable is based on the financial performance of ASL. The services
covered by the charge include the use of Walmart intellectual property, which is broadly defined as trade marks, business strategies and
business systems. These costs will no longer be applicable following the Separation. However, on-going use of Walmart's trade marks,
business strategies and business systems will be covered by the TSA, the TMA and the ASA.

(N)   The ISD recharge adjustment removes recharges paid to Walmart in respect of IT services that are allowable for tax purposes. This cost will
no longer be applicable following the Separation. However, some of the same services that this cost captures will be covered by the TSA.

(O) The TSA charge adjustment relates the charge under the TSA for on-going access to Walmart's IT services, business systems and
technology related intellectual property following the Separation.

(P) For the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, other adjustments relate to: £8.0 million in adjustments relating to the impact of having had
an additional trading day in February 2020 as a result of leap year and £10.0 million in IT and non-IT costs relating to ASDA operating as a
standalone company. These costs include the increase in the commissions payable by the Company as consideration for the services
provided to the Company by Walmart Global Sourcing, the increase in costs associated with ocean freight, the costs incurred in connection
with the creation of new roles to replace certain capabilities previously sourced from Walmart and the cost of insurance cover replacing the
insurance cover ASDA has received prior to the Separation through Walmart under Walmart's umbrella insurance policies.

(Q) This adjustment relates to certain one-off costs due to the impact of COVID-19 (£226 million), net of certain one-off benefits related to the
UK government's business rates holiday for businesses affected by COVID-19 (£171 million). Management has identified incremental costs
for the first three quarters of 2020 due to COVID-19, including costs resulting from colleague absences (due to quarantine requirements and
protective measures taken for vulnerable colleagues), a one-time "thank you" bonus paid by the Company, costs relating to goods not for
resale (e.g., face masks, safety provisions, additional security and screens), incremental inventory and supplier costs and the impact of
changes in product mix that are expected to be temporary. Management identified a one-off benefit of £171 million, being approximately £28
million per month for the period from April 2020 to September 2020, resulting from a business rates holiday announced by the UK
government, which applies to businesses in eligible sectors, including retail businesses, for the UK 2020-2021 tax year. On December 3,
2020, however, ASDA announced its decision to pay business rates tax relief accepted from the UK government in 2020. In calculating this
adjustment we have not taken into account any benefit related to the increase in revenues we have experienced as a result of and during
the COVID-19 pandemic.

(R) In connection with the Acquisition, the Shareholders engaged an international leading consultant to assist them in conducting financial and
operational due diligence on ASDA management's plan, with a particular focus on SG&A costs (excluding personnel costs). Based on these
due diligence activities conducted to date in connection with the Acquisition, the Shareholders currently believe that there is an opportunity
to achieve net run-rate cost savings of £60 million from ASDA's SG&A cost base (excluding personnel costs) within 18 months of the
Acquisition Completion Date. In particular, the Shareholders expect projected cost savings from product rationalisation and business
integration initiatives. While detailed bottom-up plans are yet to be developed due to regulatory restrictions in place prior to the CMA's
approval of the Acquisition, these SG&A cost savings estimated to be realised within 18 months of the Acquisition Completion Date represent
only 1.3% of ASDA's SG&A costs of £4.5 billion during the 12 months ended September 30, 2020. The CMA might complete its regulatory
approval process relating to the Acquisition later than currently anticipated. Any such delay by the CMA might limit our ability to achieve
these expected SG&A cost savings, whether within the timeframe or to the full extent currently anticipated. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes"_
and "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart."

(S) EG foodservice partnership synergies relate to rental income payable from EG Group to ASDA related to EG Group's roll out of foodservice
restaurants across the existing ASDA estate.

(T) Synergies from the roll out of the ASDA wholesale convenience business relate to the anticipated benefit from the incremental wholesale
margin from the roll out of the ASDA convenience proposition (ASDA On the Move) across the EG Group's network. ASDA On the Move is
a wholesale arrangement whereby ASDA's own brand products as well as branded products will be sold in third-party-owned smaller
convenience store formats. The adjustment of £7.0 million reflects the Shareholders' estimates of the total potential forward-looking run-rate
synergies that could be realised in the first 24 months as a result of the Transactions.

(U) The adjustment eliminates the EBITDA generated by the Forecourt Assets that will be disposed of pursuant to the Forecourt Business
Disposal. See "The Transactions—The Post-Completion Transactions—Forecourt Disposals."

(V) Rent for Warehouse Assets refers solely to the rental costs associated with the Warehouse Assets. In addition to the Broker's Opinion of
Pricing prepared by Colliers, the Issuers received advice from Eastdil Secured in connection with the rental pricing of the Warehouse Assets.
This adjustment reflects additional input from Eastdil Secured on the rental pricing of the Warehouse Assets (and, in particular, those
Warehouse Assets which are cold storage facilities and would be included in the disposal of any Warehouse Assets as a landlord's fixture
and fitting). The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower aims to refinance the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility using
only proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions, which relate to such Warehouse Assets. However, the funds raised from the
Warehouse Sale Transactions may not be sufficient for this purpose. If this is the case, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility
Borrower is expected to supplement the proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions with additional proceeds from the transfer of some
or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the Substitute Retail Assets in sale transactions with unaffiliated
third parties. Any rental costs associated with any Select Retail Assets or Substitute Retail Assets so disposed of are not included in this
adjustment. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—We may not be able to consummate the Post-Completion Disposals as
_quickly as we anticipate, or at all, and the manner in which we execute the Post-Completion Disposals may differ from what we present in_
_this Offering Memorandum" and "The Transactions."_

(4) Free Cash Flow is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure. The following table sets forth a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to Adjusted EBITDA.

(A)  Including petrol. IFRS 16 was adopted on January 1, 2019. The modified retrospective approach was taken: prior year comparatives have
not been restated. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 and for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 is presented on an
IFRS 16 basis. Adoption of IFRS 16 in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a decrease to operating costs of £31.4 million and an
increase to finance costs of £52.7 million compared with lease-related expenses charged in the prior year under IAS 17. Adoption of IFRS
16 is the primary reason for the increase in lease interest of £52.7 million and increase in depreciation of assets held under leases of £149.5
million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year: as these line items are added back to the calculation of EBITDA,
this results in a higher EBITDA than if prepared under IAS 17, which would include operating lease expense charges in EBITDA. The
operating lease expense included in EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2018 is £188.3 million.

_(6) Pro forma net debt consists of the Issuers' pro forma indebtedness in respect of the Notes, the Term Loan Facilities and leases, net of ASDA's estimated_
average cash and cash equivalents from January 4 to February 2, 2021 (inclusive), as adjusted to give _pro forma effect to the consummation of the_
Transactions on the Acquisition Completion Date. Pro forma net debt does not include any indebtedness in respect of the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility, which is expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the Warehouse Sale Transactions, or the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, which is
expected to be repaid with the proceeds of the Forecourt Assets Disposal. See "Capitalisation." Our presentation and calculation of the ratio of pro forma

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. In addition to the other information contained_
_in this Offering Memorandum, you should carefully consider the following risk factors before purchasing_
_the Notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones the Group faces. Additional_
_risks and uncertainties of which the Group is not aware or that it currently believes are immaterial may_
_also adversely affect the Group's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. If any_
_of the possible events described below were to occur, the Group's business, financial condition, results_
_of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. If that happens, the Issuers may_
_not be able to pay interest or principal on the Notes, respectively, when due, and you could lose all or_
_part of your investment._

_This Offering Memorandum also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and_
_uncertainties. The Group's actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-_
_looking statements as a result of various factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in_
_this Offering Memorandum. See "Forward-Looking Statements."_

**Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry**

**Risks Relating to Our General Operations**

**_We operate in a highly competitive industry and our business, financial condition and results_**
**_operations, as well as the strength of our brand, may be materially adversely affected by actions_**
**_of our competitors and our failure to respond to competitive pressures._**

The UK grocery market is particularly competitive. There can be no assurance that we can continue to
successfully compete with existing competitors or new market entrants. Our competition generally includes
international and domestic brick-and-mortar retailers (including, generalist grocers, supermarket chains,
discount retailers, grocery specialists and convenience stores), some of which also operate omni-channel
businesses, as well as online pure players, such as Amazon and Ocado. In recent years, the historically
stable grocery retail market in the United Kingdom has undergone a structural shift towards discounters,
such as Aldi and Lidl, convenience formats and online retailers, to the detriment of traditional supermarkets
and hypermarkets. We generally compete for, among other things, customers, market share, employees,
digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of the business with many other
local, regional, national and global omni-channel retailers, wholesale operators and retail intermediaries.
Our competitors generally compete with us on the basis of, among other things, price, quality, selection,
availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, shopping convenience,
brand reputation, overall shopping experience, attractiveness and ease of use of our online platforms, cost
and delivery speed of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel
integration of our physical and digital operations.

In executing our strategy, we may face a variety of competitive challenges, including, among others:

  - potential emergence of new competitors, including foreign and domestic retailers entering our
markets, or consolidation, strengthening or expanded offerings of existing operators, as has been
the case in recent years with the emergence of discounters (for more information, see "Industry"
and "Business—Key Strengths");

  - potential creation by competitors of new store formats, additional convenience grocery retail store
offerings, in-store or online services, delivery and pick-up options or online platforms that
customers may prefer;

  - the risk of our competitors successfully adopting our business model in their own stores;

  - competitive pressure on product pricing from core competitors, as well as discount and online
retailers; and

  - the risk of our competitors providing better service, quality, value or availability of products.

The performance of our competitors and changes in their pricing, promotions, product mix or other
business strategies, and our response (or failure to respond) to such competitive pressures, may lead to
lower sales revenue, higher operating expenses and/or lower profit margins and may require a significant
amount of management attention and resources, which may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse
effect on our ongoing business operations. There can be no assurance that, with evolving customer
preferences, our customers will not shift towards competitors with a different business model.

### 75


-----

Even in geographies, channels and formats where we have a strong retail presence, we face the risk
that new retail market entrants may attempt to gain market share through pricing pressure. For example,
the UK grocery retail market has seen the rapid growth of discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and
Lidl) that compete through differentiation on price coupled with a more limited selection of own-brand
products. We experience downward pricing pressure, and if we are unable to maintain our competitive
position, we could experience additional downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products,
reduced retail margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market
share, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

In recent years, and in particular during the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for online shopping
services has increased substantially and many of our competitors have expanded their online offerings. If
our competitors are able to offer faster or cheaper deliveries, and/or more convenient delivery options, we
could lose current or potential customers, our brand and reputation could suffer, all of which could have a
material adverse effect on our results of operations. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop
and enhance our online offering and the information systems that support our online activities, as well
continue to optimise our logistics and distribution capabilities. This may require the acquisition of
equipment and software and the development, either internally or through third-parties, of new proprietary
software and logistics and distribution solutions. In addition, any impairment of or disruption to our supply
chain or delivery fleet could result in a disruption in the delivery of our products to our online customers,
which could harm our brand and could generate additional costs. Furthermore, the online grocery industry
in the United Kingdom may not sustain or improve upon current levels of demand, and we may fail to
develop our online retail proposition to successfully appeal to a broader customer base and sustain current
growth rates. If we are unable to effectively compete with our online competitors or if we fail to retain and
attract online customers, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. Additionally, we may fail to successfully compete with the growing convenience retail
market. If we are unable to successfully expand our operations into the convenience retail market and the
convenience retail market continues to grow, this may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The impact of COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to_**
**_create uncertainty in our market and materially impact our business, financial condition and results_**
**_of operations for the foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control._**

In late 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARSCoV-2), which can cause coronavirus disease (COVID-19), was detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020,
the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and governmental authorities
around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. For example, in March 2020,
the United Kingdom imposed the first set of significant lockdown measures to control the spread of COVID19. These measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 have adversely affected workforces, customer
sentiment, economies and financial markets, and, along with causing overall decreased customer
spending and widespread uncertainty following months of lockdowns and related uncertainty, have led to
an economic downturn in the United Kingdom and have had a direct impact on our business.

COVID-19 poses a risk to our colleagues, our customers, our suppliers and the communities in which
we operate. As the pandemic has developed, customer fear about becoming ill with the virus and
recommendations and/or mandates from national and local authorities to social distance or self-quarantine
have continued to have an impact on the UK marketplace. These recommendations and mandates, as
well as general fears about gathering in public places, has adversely affected, among other things, our instore traffic, our ability to adequately staff our stores, depots, packing and processing facilities and other
facilities and our suppliers' ability to provide products on a timely basis. See "Management's Discussion
_and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Result of_
_Operations—COVID-19." If we do not respond appropriately or in a timely enough manner to the pandemic_
and its effects, or if customers or colleagues perceive our response to be inadequate or inappropriate, our
brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

Resurgences (or "waves") of COVID-19 are likely to occur. We cannot predict when or where these
waves will occur, the duration of such waves, how far into the future such waves will continue to occur nor
can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent waves, including the impacts of future
national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by national and/or local authorities. As of
January 2021, subsequent waves of COVID-19 were significantly affecting many countries, including the
United Kingdom and other countries from which we source products, with cases rising markedly in recent
weeks and with new, more contagious strains of the virus emerging. On October 12, 2020, the UK Prime
Minister announced a three-tiered system of restrictions across England, which came into effect on

### 76


-----

October 14, 2020 in order to help control the spread of the virus. Under this system, regions are classified
as either 'medium', 'high' or 'very high' risk and assigned increasingly stringent lockdown restrictions to
correspond with their designated tier. On November 5, 2020, the United Kingdom imposed its second set
of significant lockdown measures, which ended on December 2, 2020. On December 18, 2020, the UK
Prime Minister announced the addition of a fourth tier in the COVID-19 restrictions system, due to the
presence of a new, more infectious variant of the virus in the United Kingdom. On December 20, the United
Kingdom imposed its third set of significant lockdown measures and placed the South East of the United
Kingdom, including London, into tier four lockdown. On January 4, 2021 the UK Prime Minister announced
the addition of a fifth tier in the COVID-19 restrictions system, the highest level of COVID-19 restrictions,
due to the record high and escalating case numbers of COVID-19 present in the United Kingdom. In tier
five, England is in a full lockdown, pursuant to which all persons are instructed to stay home except for a
few necessary purposes, including essential work and buying food and medicine. The tier five lockdown
is expected to continue until at least February 15, 2021. While none of our grocery retail stores have been
closed as a result of such lockdowns, there can be no guarantee that this will continue to be the case or
that more stringent rules and restrictions will not be applied in the future in a manner that could materially
adversely impact our business. Additionally, local authorities have imposed and may impose stricter rules
and restrictions in addition to those imposed by the national tiered system, which may have further material
adverse impacts on our business and industry. The placement of areas into the tiers is outside of our
control and is expected to be dynamic and unpredictable for the foreseeable future. The tiered alert system
applies only to England: the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in
charge of designing and implementing their own COVID-19 restrictions, which may be as or more stringent
than the English tiered system. In light of rising case levels in the United Kingdom and around the world,
future national and local lockdowns are foreseeable. Additionally, there may be a decrease in demand for
certain of our products in the event of further resurgences of COVID-19 or the occurrence of other
pandemics, other public health emergencies or threats, or potential or perceived threats to food and drug
safety, any of which may necessitate certain regulatory responses and the result of which may materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We currently operate our grocery retail stores and facilities as an "essential" business. If the
classification of what an "essential" business is changes, or other government regulations are adopted,
we may be required to severely or even completely curtail operations, which would have a material adverse
impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even though our stores and facilities
are considered essential businesses, national and local authorities may impose regulations and limitations
on the operations of our stores and facilities, such as, among other things, limiting customer traffic, hours
of operation or access to certain products (as has been the case in Wales, where "firebreak" measures
have limited the products that grocery retailers are permitted to sell during the firebreak period to certain
essential goods), requiring us to implement track and trace measures and mandating certain health and
safety measures. Complying with these regulations and limitations requires the diversion of financial and
human resources away from other parts of our business and increases costs, which may have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our noncompliance, or perceived non-compliance with lockdown measures could lead to formal sanctions and
could also harm our brand and reputation.

Even while our stores are open, social distancing and other policies implemented to slow the further
spread of COVID-19 may impact the operation and appeal of our stores. For example, customers
unaccustomed to wearing face coverings or observing social distancing guidance may choose to shop
online, which may reduce our in-store business. Even when social distancing policies are lifted, interest in
visiting stores and making discretionary purchases may remain weak due to health concerns or
recessionary spending patterns. Furthermore, we believe that some of the changes that have arisen during
and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by us and in the United Kingdom as a whole will be persistent
and potentially long-lasting, while others may be less so. For example, following the end of the pandemic,
there may be a shift of consumer preferences to more out-of-home dining, which could materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Certain of our colleagues have tested positive for COVID-19. We have, and may in the future be
required to temporarily close certain of our stores, offices or other facilities for cleaning or to take other
responsive or precautionary measures. Likewise, planned construction, renovation and maintenance, as
well as the opening of new stores may be delayed, suspended or terminated due to COVID-19-related
requirements, such as requiring that workers only leave their homes for essential business, or due to the
suspension of governmental permit issuances due to the pandemic. Where appropriate and possible, we
have transitioned a significant number of our colleagues to a remote work environment, in an effort to
mitigate the spread of COVID-19, which may exacerbate certain risks to our business.

### 77


-----

A large part of our workforce, such as our colleagues who work in our stores, factories or our distribution
facilities, cannot work remotely and we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken can fully
mitigate the risks posed to them and to our customers by COVID-19 and we may be subject to potential
litigation as a result of colleagues alleging that we have facilitated an unsafe working environment or have
increased their exposure to COVID-19, or customers or colleagues who claim they have contracted the
virus at our stores or other facilities, which may cause us to incur significant costs and which may have a
negative impact on our brand and reputation. During the first lockdown, we experienced increased costs,
including, amongst others, as a result of goodwill payments to suppliers, increased employment costs
relating to increased absences (including for sick colleagues or colleagues following quarantine
recommendations), full pay to vulnerable staff members during the 12-week isolation period, employment
of safety marshals and operation of stores with extended hours to decrease store congestion. Certain of
these costs continued during the second lockdown and we may be subject to similar costs in the event of
future lockdowns. We may also be subject to potential litigation initiated by colleagues alleging that we
have facilitated an unsafe working environment or have increased their exposure to COVID-19. All of these
risks may be further exacerbated by resurgences of the virus. Although the government has increasingly
employed sophisticated strategies for combatting the virus such as Test and Trace and localised R-factor
measurement in an effort to avoid costly and extensive lockdown measures, the magnitude of possible
virus resurgences and the resulting impacts on the economy may materially negatively impact our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary spending by customers, public health events
and other factors described elsewhere in this "Risk Factors" section. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic
has caused, and is continuing to cause, significant disruption in economic activity globally, which is
expected to lead to a decline in discretionary spending. Our revenue may be negatively impacted by
adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates,
declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth resulting from the impact of COVID-19 and measures
implemented to respond to it. Although we are generating revenue, our revenue may not increase in
proportion to our fixed costs and deferred costs and our revenue may not be sufficient to offset the full
impact of a potential shutdown of our stores, were that to occur, or curtailment of our operations. If our
cost base is higher than our revenue, our cash management policies may fail due to factors beyond our
control. In 2020, our profitability has been adversely impacted by COVID-19 in terms of increased costs
associated with retail colleague wages, bonus payments and higher retail operating expenditures. During
the first lockdown, consumers favoured convenience stores over larger grocery retail stores. Unlike the
traditional grocers, currently we do not operate any convenience grocery retail stores and, as a result, this
shift towards convenience grocery retail stores adversely affected us. Future lockdowns with similar
consumer preferences could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. COVID-19 has also impacted our sales in terms of product mix, with changing customer habits
towards less out-of-home consumption, stockpiling and increased use of online grocery services driving
higher food sales volumes, while decreased clothing sales and the temporary closure of our ASDA Living
stores has led to decreases in non-food sales and the effects of lockdowns on automobile usage has
driven decreases in fuel sales.

During the first wave of COVID-19 and the accompanying lockdown periods, we relied on access to
government aid and mitigation programmes, including the business rates relief holiday for the 2020 to
2021 tax year. Our mitigation strategy was reinforced by legislation such as the UK Coronavirus Act 2020,
the Coronavirus (Scotland) Acts of 2020 and the UK Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020,
which introduced certain protections in relation to lease forfeitures (and irritancies), and temporary
restrictions on the ability of creditors to file statutory demands and winding up petitions in the United
Kingdom based solely on the failure to comply with (for example) rent payment obligations as a result of
COVID-19. However, in December 2020, we announced our intention to voluntarily resume payments of
the applicable business rate, for the period during the COVID-19 pandemic where we had benefitted from
the business rates holiday relief. We estimate that the payment of business rates for the full period of the
business rates holiday to range from approximately £320 million to £340 million. While we have entered
into initial discussions with HMRC around repayment, the mechanism and timing of repayment has not yet
been agreed. During subsequent waves of COVID-19 such government aid, mitigation programmes,
negotiations with landlords and/or protective legislation may not be available to the same extent as in the
past and our cash outlay levels to meet ongoing additional COVID-19 related costs might be significantly
higher during such subsequent waves than they were during the first wave. Therefore, we would only be
able to rely on our ability to pause capital expenditures, implement cost reductions and defer payments,
which could significantly reduce our overall ability to mitigate potential cash burn.

In addition to the lockdown measures imposed in the United Kingdom, on December 20, 2020,
numerous countries across Europe, including France, imposed travel restrictions on travellers from the
United Kingdom in response to the discovery and spread of the more infectious variant of the virus in the
United Kingdom. Such restrictions resulted in a temporary disruption of the main trade routes between
Europe and the United Kingdom, in particular at UK ports.

On December 21, 2020, the Port of Dover halted all exports to France for 48 hours in response to the
travel restrictions imposed by the French government on travellers from the United Kingdom. We rely on
UK ports such as the Port of Dover to import a large portion of our supplies. We can provide no assurance
that significant restrictions affecting movement of goods into or out of UK ports will not be imposed in the
future, including as a measure to control the spread of COVID-19. Such restrictions may result in significant
disruption and delays to our supply chain and may require us to incur additional costs or make
amendments to our usual supply chain, which may in turn have a material and adverse effect on our
business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

On December 22, 2020, France reopened its borders with the United Kingdom to lorry drivers, provided
they are tested for COVID-19. Future travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic imposed by France
or other European countries could lead to further and longer supply disruptions for the goods we import
from or through Europe. Such disruptions could result in our inability to offer certain products to customers
or force us to increase prices of certain products, which could have a material adverse effect on our
revenues and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition to the factors listed above, COVID-19 and the measures taken to respond to it have created
an environment of uncertainty and rapid, unpredictable changes that exacerbates and magnifies certain
of the other risks we face. The effect of COVID-19 on our business and our wider industry will ultimately
depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic in
the United Kingdom and globally, the length of time it takes for demand to return to normal levels and for
normal economic and operating conditions to resume and the potential for, and uncertainty surrounding,
virus resurgence. There are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance, and so we cannot
yet know the full impact of COVID-19 on our business with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance
that COVID-19 will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations in the future. To the extent COVID-19 impacts our business, financial condition and results of
operations, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this "Risk Factors" section,
such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to
service our indebtedness and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that
govern our indebtedness. Each of the factors above may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Result of Operations—COVID-19."_

**_The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union may lead to increased costs and_**
**_potential staff shortages, adverse currency impacts and increased regulatory burden._**

We are a UK-based company and operate principally within the United Kingdom. On June 23, 2016, a
majority of voters in the United Kingdom opted to withdraw from the European Union in a national
referendum and on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union ("Brexit").
On December 24, 2020, it was announced that a draft trade and cooperation agreement had been agreed
between the United Kingdom government and the EU Commission. This agreement has provisional
application as of January 1, 2021, was ratified on December 30, 2020 by the UK Parliament and is subject
to formal approval by the European Parliament. If the agreement is not formally approved by the European
Parliament, the United Kingdom will no longer have access to the European Union Single Market, which,
could result, among other things, in the disruption of the free movement of goods, services and people
between the United Kingdom and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic
areas and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other nations
as the United Kingdom pursues independent trade relations. This could have an impact on our operations
and on the general and economic conditions in the United Kingdom.

Following withdrawal from the European Union, barrier-free trade access between the United Kingdom
and other member states of the European Union could be diminished or eliminated and the United
Kingdom may no longer be covered by trade agreements entered into by the European Union which apply
to all member states and so will either have to seek to negotiate new trade agreements or join existing
trade agreements (such as the World Trade Organisation tariffs) which could result in the transfer of goods
between the European Union and the United Kingdom, or between certain non-European Union countries
and the United Kingdom, becoming subject to import/export duties and/or non-tariff trade barriers
(including health and safety, product labelling and other standards, many of which are currently
standardised across the European Union). Such trade barriers could lead to delays to our logistics and

### 79


-----

distribution operations including delays in the importation of fresh produce or a reduction of our product
catalogue (we have modelled scenarios with respect to a reduction in capacity at Calais and have instituted
a port delay risk mitigation plan to be deployed in case of delays) and result in the cost of doing business
being materially adversely affected if not passed on, in whole or in part, to customers in the form of price
increases. Even if we are able to pass on some or all of such costs through price increases, such price
increases may influence customer spending decisions and priorities and adversely impact our revenue.
According to UK government figures, in 2019, 26% of food consumed in the United Kingdom was sourced
from the European Union, and we believe that a similar percentage applies to our own food sales. A loss
of access to global trade deals could lead to import tariffs that increase our supply costs.

Additionally, since we operate 17 stores in Northern Ireland, Brexit could have an additional impact on
our business, results of operation and prospects due to significant bureaucratic hurdles. Currently, the EU
has granted the United Kingdom a six-month exemption from the EU ban on prohibited and restricted
goods (such as minced meat) being transported into Northern Ireland. Once this exemption ends in July
2021, ASDA will require alternative sourcing. In addition, current Brexit proposals would result in the
required significant re-labelling and customs classification and declarations on products sold in Northern
Ireland. We may not be able to preserve our profit margin during periods of increased food inflation and
increased production costs without suffering reduced revenue, which in turn could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Another potential outcome of the
United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union is that limitations may be placed on the principle
of free movement of people which currently permits European Union nationals to work in the United
Kingdom. IPL and certain of our primary producers and suppliers currently employ a significant number of
European Union nationals and since the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union is
expected to lead to restrictions being placed on European Union nationals working in the United Kingdom,
the number of people employed by these primary producers and suppliers may decline which could have
a material and adverse effect on their business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

The referendum result has created significant political and economic uncertainty about the future
relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union generally, and the United Kingdom's
future trading relationship with countries within and outside the European Union specifically, which could
make adverse changes in general economic conditions or adverse exchange rate movements more likely
to occur and which could, in turn, have a material and adverse effect on our operations and financial
performance.

The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, including the above effects and others we
cannot anticipate, could lead to increased costs, potential staff shortages, adverse currency impacts and
increased regulatory burden and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects. See also "—The occurrence of catastrophic events, such as war,
_terrorist attacks, civil unrest, disruptive geopolitical events, epidemics, pandemics and natural disasters,_
_could materially adversely affect our and our suppliers' (including other third parties on which we rely)_
_business, financial condition and results of operations."_

**_Any events that negatively impact the reputation of, or value associated with, our brands could_**
**_materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects._**

Our brand and reputation constitute a significant part of our value proposition. Our success has been
founded in part on our ability to develop our brand as a leading UK retailer of quality, competitively priced
grocery, clothing and general merchandise. Maintaining the reputation of and value associated with our
brand is central to the success of our business. This can be an especially difficult task for retailers,
particularly in light of the development of social media in recent years, which has led to a sharp increase
in reputational risks. Any event, such as a significant product recall or negative press reaction to
statements made or actions taken, or the failure to make certain statements or take certain actions, by us
or our senior management, that could damage our brand or reputation or cause customers to lose
confidence in the safety and quality of the products we sell could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our principal brand names and trade marks (such as the ASDA logo) are key assets of our business.
See "Business—Our Intellectual Property." We rely upon a combination of copyright and trade mark laws
to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, but cannot be certain that the actions we have
taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent material violation of our proprietary rights. There
can be no assurance that litigation will not be necessary to enforce our trade mark or proprietary rights or
to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of third parties. Adverse publicity, legal
action or other factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of our brand, which could lead to
decreased customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and
results of operations. See also "—From time to time we and/or our management are subject to claims that

### 80


-----

_can result in litigation, arbitration, tax or regulatory proceedings which could distract management from_
_our business activities and result in significant liability."_

The brand names of our own-brand products also represent an important asset of our business. Certain
of these own-brand items are manufactured and/or packaged by third parties, and while our policies set
out quality control standards, we do not control these third parties or their quality control, employment,
ethics or other business practices. If we are unable to control and guarantee the quality of our own-brand
products, our reputation may be damaged, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. Maintaining broad market acceptance of our own-brand items
depends on many factors, including pricing, costs, quality and customer perception, and we may not
achieve or maintain expected sales for our own-brand label items. See also "—We rely on certain suppliers
_and partners, some of which are third parties, and any failure by these suppliers and partners to comply_
_with obligations could have a materially adverse impact our brand, reputation, business, results of_
_operations and financial condition and our agreements with these suppliers and partners may be subject_
_to adjustments that could increase our expenses."_

In light of the stringent employment, health and safety, environmental and other regulations to which
we are subject and the scrutiny we face from, among others, regulators, other national or local authorities,
non-governmental organisations and other stakeholders, a violation, or allegations of a violation of such
laws or regulations, or a failure to achieve particular standards by any of our suppliers or manufacturers
we purchase goods from, could lead to unfavourable publicity and a decline in demand for our products,
or require us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our supply chain and other business
arrangements to ensure compliance. Any such events concerning us or any of the manufacturers or
suppliers that supply products to us could substantially erode the reputation of, or value associated with,
our brands and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of
operations. Likewise, any failure to meet workplace health and safety or other legal standards and any
death, injury or illness to customers, colleagues, contractors, suppliers or third parties may lead to a loss
of trust and confidence in us, as well as litigation and/or financial or other penalties being imposed.

**_Adverse developments with respect to the safety and quality of our products, including loss of_**
**_customer confidence in the food supply chain or the quality and safety of our products for any_**
**_reason, and/or concerns about the safety of the food industry in general, may damage our_**
**_reputation, increase our costs of operations or decrease demand for our products._**

Food and product safety and food hygiene and traceability (including in respect of product origins,
freshness and conditions of preservation through the supply chain) are top priorities for us: the actual
safety of the food and other products and services we offer, as well as the public's perception of that safety,
are essential to our business, brand and reputation. We are subject to a number of food safety and hygiene
regulations. See "Business—Regulation—Food Safety, Hygiene, Labelling and Nutrition and Consumer
_Protection." Failures to comply with these regulations could result in a number of adverse consequences,_
including fines, loss of licences, costs of compliance or certification requirements.

We may not be able to ensure that our customers always enjoy safe, quality products. We sell food for
human consumption, which subjects us to safety risks such as contamination (including the presence of
an undeclared allergen, a foreign object, substance, unintentional microbe or chemical, other agent or
residue or the introduction of a genetically modified organism), spoilage, mislabelling and product
tampering, all of which could lead to product withdrawals or recalls or destruction of inventory and could
result in bad publicity, temporary store or warehouse closures and substantial costs in connection with
compliance or remediation. We may also be impacted by any assertion that our products have caused
illness or injury, whether true or false, proven or unproven. We could also be subject to claims or lawsuits
relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury stemming from product contamination, spoilage,
mislabelling, product tampering or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of our
products. From time to time we also recall products.

Risks to the health of our customers can also arise from our branded and own label suppliers, some of
whom are third-parties who operate outside of our direct control, in relation to the ingredients, foods and
products we sell in our stores. For example, we rely on suppliers, some of whom are third-parties who
operate outside of our control, for ingredients, foods and products we sell in our stores. Our use of thirdparty suppliers increases the risk that any of the aforementioned types of incidents could be caused by
factors outside of our control and that multiple locations could be affected. In addition, food or product
safety-related risks may also occur under any one of our own-brand labels and we may be impacted by
negative publicity regarding any assertion that our food or other products have resulted in illness or injury.
Our customers expect that we will provide them with a large selection of safe, high-quality products. If we
are unable to control and guarantee the quality of the products we sell, especially our own-brand products
and in-store services, our brand and reputation may be negatively impacted.

### 81


-----

We rely upon electrical power to operate all of our facilities across our distribution network. To attain
maximum performance, these types of facilities must often operate on a continuous basis and at the
appropriate pre-set temperatures. As a result, any shortage or interruption in power supply may result in
food spoilage and any extended power supply shortages or interruptions could result in perishable food
losses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. Cold chain requirements, setting out the temperatures at which our ingredients and products
must be stored and transported, are established both by law and by us to help guarantee the safety of our
food products. Our cold chain must be maintained from the moment the ingredients arrive at, or are frozen
by, our suppliers, through transportation and ultimately to the time of sale in our stores or delivery to our
customers. A failure in our cold chain could lead to food spoilage, risks to the health of our customers,
fines and other penalties and damage to our brand and reputation, each of which could materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Consumers are increasingly focused on the traceability of food products to assist them in deciding what
to purchase. In January 2013, incidents of horse meat in parts of the European food supply chain
mislabelled as beef were identified, negatively impacting retailers and producers throughout Europe,
including ASDA, and led to additional standards, such as BRC standards on traceability, food fraud and
food defence. While we conduct quality practices and procedures, it may be difficult to detect
contamination, spoilage, mislabelling, product tampering or any other incidents that compromise the safety
and quality of our products, particularly fraudulent or malicious activity. Adverse publicity about these types
of problems, whether valid or not, may discourage customers from buying our products or may affect our
brand and reputation. Our actual or perceived sale of unsafe food products could result in product liability
claims, a loss of customer confidence, product recalls and legal claims, which could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We also face additional risks from product defects in relation to the sale of our non-food products,
including, for example, the risks of battery explosions, appliance malfunction or toys or other items that
prove to be dangerous. If products we purchase from our suppliers are damaged or defective, we may not
be able to return products to these suppliers and obtain refunds on our purchase price or obtain
indemnification from them for any damages caused. Our brand and reputation could be damaged by the
marketing of such dangerous or defective products, especially in case of serious defects, such as products
containing harmful substances, causing death, physical harm or other health problems. In addition, there
is a risk that compliance lapses by us or by our suppliers could occur, which could lead to investigation by
agencies responsible for customer product safety. In all such cases, especially if there is a prolonged
impact on product quality, our brand and reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations
may be materially adversely affected.

Certain risks are inherent in the operation of food-to-go, serve-over and self-serve counters and our
brand and reputation could be damaged to the extent the quality of these facilities fall below our
established standards. For example, if particular temperatures and environments are not properly
maintained, food safety could be compromised and harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or Listeria
monocytogenes could develop. Additionally, these facilities are also subject to public tampering and
contamination, over which we have limited control.

A significant lawsuit, widespread product recall or other events leading to the loss of customer
confidence in the safety and quality of our products could damage our brand and reputation and negatively
impact our sales, profitability and prospects for growth. Further, if a product recall is required in
circumstances where the financial consequences are not covered by the relevant supplier or our
insurance, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Although we maintain
product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually
incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.
Even if future product liability claims against us are unsuccessful, these claims could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert our management's time and resources from operating our business and may
harm our brand and reputation.

Even if our products are not affected by contamination or other incidents that compromise their safety
and quality, we are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by
widespread contamination, widespread diseases (such as H1N1, SARS, MERS, BSE and avian influenza)
and evolving nutritional and health-related concerns. Regulatory authorities may limit the supply of certain
types of food products in response to public health concerns, and customers may perceive certain products
to be unsafe or unhealthy, which could require us or our suppliers to find alternative ingredients or products
that may not be available at commercially reasonable prices or within acceptable time constraints. In
addition, such governmental regulations may require us to identify replacement products for our customers
or, alternatively, to discontinue certain offerings or limit the range of product offerings. We may be unable

### 82


-----

to find substitutes that are as appealing to our customers, or such substitutes may not be widely available
or may be available only at increased costs. Such substitutions or limitations could also reduce demand
for our products. Each of the factors above may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations. See also "—Any events that negatively impact the reputation of, or
_value associated with, our brands could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and_
_prospects."_

**_Our business is dependent on the economic situation in the United Kingdom and we are exposed_**
**_to local, regional, national and global economic, political, social and other trends that could_**
**_materially adversely impact our operations and financial performance._**

General economic conditions in the United Kingdom and globally may adversely affect our financial
performance. Higher interest rates, fluctuating petroleum product prices (including crude oil, natural gas,
gasoline, and diesel fuel), higher costs for electricity and other energy, weakness in the housing market,
inflation, deflation, increased costs of essential services, higher levels of unemployment, decreases in
disposable income, reduced access to customer credit, higher customer debt levels, changes in customer
spending and shopping patterns, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, higher tax rates, imposition of
new taxes or other changes in tax laws, state-implemented austerity measures, other regulatory changes,
the imposition of tariffs or other measures that create barriers to or increase the costs associated with
international trade, overall economic slowdown or recession and other UK or global economic factors could
materially adversely affect customer demand for the products we sell, cause us to change the mix of
products we sell to one with a lower average gross margin, cause a slowdown in discretionary purchases
of goods, adversely affect our revenue and result in slower inventory turnover and greater markdowns of
inventory, or otherwise materially adversely affect our operations and results of operations and could result
in impairment charges to intangible assets, goodwill or other long-lived assets.

In addition to the economic factors listed above, any other economic factors or circumstances resulting
in higher transportation, labour, insurance costs or commodity prices, and other economic factors could
increase our cost of sales and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses and otherwise
materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Our revenue and profitability may be correlated to customer discretionary spending, which is influenced
by the cyclical nature of the general economy, levels of unemployment, population demographics,
inflationary/deflationary cycles, real disposable income, VAT increases, interest rates, the availability of
customer credit and customer perception of overall economic conditions and their own economic
prospects, all of which are factors beyond our control. For example, these factors may make it more difficult
to maintain our low prices or may result in decreased footfall at our stores and decreased traffic for our
online business. Unfavourable economic conditions or economic, social or political uncertainty globally or
in the United Kingdom could significantly adversely affect our revenue, growth and profitability and could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or ability to
implement our strategy.

As a UK business, we are particularly affected by the economic, political and social conditions
prevailing from time to time in the United Kingdom. We cannot assure you that we will be able to sustain
our current profit levels if adverse economic, political and social events or circumstances occur in the
United Kingdom. See also "—The occurrence of catastrophic events, such as war, terrorist attacks, civil
_unrest, disruptive geopolitical events, epidemics, pandemics and natural disasters, could materially_
_adversely affect our and our suppliers' (including other third parties on which we rely) business, financial_
_condition and results of operations," "—The impact of COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant_
_and its effects will continue to create uncertainty in our market and materially impact our business, financial_
_condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are_
_beyond our control" and "—The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union may lead to_
_increased costs and potential staff shortages, adverse currency impacts and increased regulatory burden."_

Our suppliers and their respective businesses, whether in the United Kingdom or abroad, may also be
adversely affected by the same, similar or other economic, political and social factors that affect our
operations, which could result in an increase in the cost to us of the goods we sell to our customers or, in
more extreme cases, in certain suppliers not producing certain goods in the volume typically available to
us for sale or at all.

During periods of adverse economic, political and social conditions, we may also have difficulty
accessing financial markets, which could make it more difficult, more expensive or impossible to obtain
funding for additional investments to expand our business and operations or for refinancing, such that we
may be unable to meet our debt service obligations, including on the Notes, or other financial obligations
as they become due. Any prolonged adverse economic, political or social environment could make it

difficult for us, as well as for our customers and suppliers, to maintain current revenue and profitability
levels and could materially limit our growth. In the past, challenging market conditions have resulted in
greater volatility and, in some cases, reduced liquidity, widening of credit spreads and a lack of price
transparency in credit markets. Each of the factors above may have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_Sales of our products are subject to changing customer preferences and trends and we may be_**
**_unable to successfully or timely respond to these changing customer preferences._**

The success of our business depends on the continued appeal of the range of products and services
we offer, as well as our ability to provide an appealing omni-channel offering that draws new and returning
customers. Given the varied backgrounds and tastes of our customer base, we must offer a sufficient
range of products to satisfy a broad spectrum of preferences.

Demand for our food products is affected by customer tastes and preferences, which are impacted by,
among other things, social trends, health concerns, ethical considerations and culinary trends. Customers
are increasingly focusing on health and wellness, including avoiding foods with certain ingredients such
as trans fats, gluten, sugar, sodium, processed wheat, animal products or other product attributes and
preferring foods which fit in to their image of a healthy lifestyle. Customers have also shown increasing
preference for vegan and organic products, ethically sourced products, environmentally-friendly product
packaging and products that support local business. We must adapt and develop products to address
these trends and preferences in a timely manner in order to remain competitive. Further, our customers
increasingly expect a seamless omni-channel experience and when making a decision to purchase
products from us, want to be able to have access to greater amounts of information than ever before,
including on traceability, environmental sustainability and nutritional value. Likewise, our clothing, home
product lines and general merchandise offer are subject to changing customer tastes in apparel and decor
and are also impacted by sustainability considerations. Customers also increasingly expect to be able to
interact with us in a variety of ways, such as through mobile application purchases, which require
investments in technology and human resources.

If we do not identify or effectively respond to customer trends and preferences in a timely manner, or if
we fail to meet our customers' expectations, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers,
demand for our products and services, our market share and the growth of our business, which could in
turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is
difficult to quickly, consistently and successfully predict the products and services our customers will be
interested in and respond to changes in their shopping patterns. Responding to shifts in customer
preferences and expectations also can entail significant costs.

The success of our business depends on how accurately and quickly we predict customer demand,
availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive
environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the
speed, ease and cost of delivery or collection options are of primary and increasing importance to
customers, particularly as a result of the growth of digital tools and social media that inform customers.
Further, if we misjudge demand for certain products, particularly for our non-food products, we may build
up excess inventory for those products, which could result in a decrease in their sales price and inefficient
working capital management which, if material, could have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations.

**_The occurrence of catastrophic events, such as war, terrorist attacks, civil unrest, disruptive_**
**_geopolitical events, epidemics, pandemics and natural disasters, could materially adversely affect_**
**_our and our suppliers' (including other third parties on which we rely) business, financial condition_**
**_and results of operations._**

The occurrence of one or more natural disasters, such as floods, fires, earthquakes, tsunamis,
hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, cyclones and typhoons; weather and climate conditions, such as
winter and summer storms, heatwaves, severe cold weather and droughts, whether as a result of climate
change or otherwise; geo-political events; public health situations, such as epidemics, pandemics and
other contagious outbreaks, such as the global coronavirus pandemic; and catastrophic events, such as
war, civil unrest, terrorist attacks or other acts of violence, including active shooter situations, knife attacks,
as well as protests, strikes and boycotts, including, for example, potential adverse reactions in response
to Brexit could materially adversely affect our and our suppliers' (including other third parties on which we
rely) business, financial condition and results of operations. See also "—The impact of COVID-19 on our
_business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to create uncertainty in our market and_
_materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future due_
_to many factors, most of which are beyond our control" and "—The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the_

### 84


-----

_European Union may lead to increased costs and potential staff shortages, adverse currency impacts and_
_increased regulatory burden."_

Such events could result in closure of, physical damage to, or the complete loss of, one or more of our
and our suppliers' (including other third parties on which we rely) properties, limitations on operating hours,
workforce shortages, the inability of customers and colleagues to reach or have transportation to our stores
and facilities, the evacuation of the population from areas in which our stores and facilities are located, the
unavailability of our online platforms or our delivery and Click & Collect services, changes in customer
purchasing patterns (including the frequency of visits to physical retail locations, whether as a result of
limitations on large gatherings, travel and movement limitations or otherwise) and in disposable income,
disruptions to supply and logistics chain, reduced availability of products in our stores, disruptions to
utilities for our stores and facilities and disruptions to our communications network. Responding to such
events and their effects may require a significant amount of management attention and resources, which
may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our ongoing business operations.

We bear the risk of losses incurred as a result of damage to, or destruction of, our and our suppliers'
(including other third parties on which we rely) stores and facilities, loss or spoilage of inventory and
business and service interruption caused by such events. These events and their impact could otherwise
disrupt and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See "—
_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to significant financial_
_risks if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate." Furthermore, we cannot provide any assurance_
that we would be able to successfully recover our costs, in full or in part, should we experience an event
of the types described above or other business continuity problem. Each of the factors above may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

**_We are vulnerable to fluctuations in the availability and price of food ingredients and products,_**
**_commodities and packing material, as well as to fluctuations in the price of electricity and fuel._**

Our results of operations are influenced by market prices for certain essential food ingredients and
products, commodities, packing materials, electricity and fuel, as well as other raw materials and energyrelated costs. Increases in prices or scarcity of any of these ingredients, commodities, products or
materials required for our business could materially increase our costs and disrupt our operations. Volatility
in the price of raw materials can result from a wide variety of factors beyond our control, including poor
harvests, weather conditions, disease, political instability and changes in climate, among many other
factors. Events such as Brexit, COVID-19 lockdowns or the threat of political or social unrest (or the
perceived threat thereof) may also have a material adverse impact on commodity, product or material
prices and transportation costs. Notwithstanding our hedging policies, we cannot fully eliminate the risks
of price movements. In addition, our ability to pass along increased costs through price increases to our
customers depends upon competitive conditions in our industry and pricing regulations and may not be
compatible with our business ethos and strategy. If we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our
customers or if the higher cost of the products offered results in decreased demand for our products, our
business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as our brand, may be materially adversely
affected. See also "—The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union may lead to increased
_costs and potential staff shortages, adverse currency impacts and increased regulatory burden" and "—_
_There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart."_

In addition, significant amounts of electricity and fuel are needed to regulate the temperature of and
operate our stores, warehouses and other facilities, as well as our fleet, and to maintain our cold chain
requirements for appropriate storage of materials and products before they are sold, and we cannot
guarantee that our energy costs will not increase in the future. Such cost increases may be significant and
could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and
prospects.

**_We may be unable to implement our business strategy or to successfully maintain and develop_**
**_our omni-channel offer and, along with the increasing complexity of our business and costs_**
**_associated with our business strategy, this may reduce demand for our products and services and_**
**_materially adversely impact our relationships with our customers, market share, results of_**
**_operations, financial condition and prospects._**

Our future performance is dependent on our ability to identify and develop business opportunities and
to successfully execute our business strategy and adapt our value proposition to relevant customer trends.
See "Business—Key Strengths" and "Business—Business Strategy." Failure to properly deploy capital
and other resources to further our strategy may negatively affect our planned initiatives. Any
misjudgements, flaws or inadequacies in our execution could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations.

### 85

The retail business continues to rapidly evolve and consumers increasingly embrace online shopping.
As a result, the portion of total customer expenditures with retailers occurring through online platforms is
increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. Accordingly, an important part of our business
strategy involves offering a seamless omni-channel customer experience by integrating innovative online
and mobile application-based solutions. Our ability to adapt our online offer and, in particular, to develop
online sales depends on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully market our websites and
social media, our ability to identify additional key partnerships for the expansion of our online channels,
the capability of our existing distribution network to accommodate our growing online operations and the
ability to integrate our growing online operations on a profitable basis. Additionally, we cannot assure you
that our online operations will become as profitable as our brick-and-mortar businesses and, as a result,
the expected increased proportion of online operations could negatively impact our future profitability. In
addition, integrating innovative omni-channel options into the retail store experience is critical for us to
maintain our market position. Our strategy also relies on identifying, developing and/or adopting key
technology solutions that allow us to integrate innovative online shopping processes into our operations.
We may not be able to secure the requisite technology to implement our strategy, either due to cost or
intellectual property rights of third parties. We may also fail to integrate new digital tools into our systems
which could reduce their effectiveness.

Our strategy, which includes investments in online channels, technology, store remodels and other
customer-focused initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our business, maintain or
grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact of the growth of our business. The success
of our strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless
omni-channel shopping experience for our customers. Failure to successfully execute this strategy may
adversely affect our market position and financial performance. In addition, increased online sales,
including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores,
which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store sales of merchandise that such traffic creates
and could reduce our sales within our stores and materially adversely affect our financial performance.

Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we
cannot guarantee the successful execution of our business strategy. Additionally, the implementation of
our strategy may put operational strain on our business and consume management time and focus to the
detriment of our existing business operations. If we do not meet our strategic objectives or achieve the
results initially expected, we may be unable to recover our investment, which may have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the cost of certain online
and technology investments, including any operating losses incurred, could adversely impact our financial
performance in the short-term and failure to realise the benefits of these investments may adversely impact
our financial performance over the longer term.

**_Competitive pressures in the apparel, footwear and homeware retail industries are high._**

The apparel, footwear and homeware retail industries are each highly competitive and the marketplace
is highly fragmented as many different retailers compete for market share by utilising a variety of store and
on-line formats and merchandising strategies. The George Clothing and George Home brands compete
on the basis of, among other things, the location of our stores; website, mobile applications and their
respective design; the breadth, quality, style price and availability of our merchandise; and the level of
customer service offered. In particular, the George Clothing brand faces competition from other low-cost
and fast fashion retailers that have recently made significant price investments in their merchandise
offerings and target some of the same categories of customers as the George Clothing brand. We expect
competition to increase in the future. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our
apparel, footwear and homeware retail sectors and our existing competitors are constantly adjusting their
pricing, business strategies and promotional activity (particularly during holiday periods) in response to
changing market conditions or their own financial condition. As a result of such competition, the George
Clothing business has experienced declining revenue over recent years.

Additionally, the substantial sales growth in online apparel, footwear and homeware retail within the
last decade has encouraged the entry of many new competitors, new business models and an increase in
competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online shopping
alternatives. The internet and other technologies also facilitates comparison shopping in our apparel,
footwear and homeware retail segments. Our digital channel competes against numerous websites,
mobile applications and catalogues, which may have a greater volume of circulation and web traffic or
more effective marketing through online media and social networking sites. We offer an omni-channel
shopping experience for our customers and use social media and mobile applications as a way to interact
with them to enhance their shopping experiences. Omni-channel retailing is constantly evolving and we
must keep pace with changing customer expectations and new developments by our competitors. There

is no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully maintain or expand our digital sales
channels and respond to shifting consumer traffic patterns and digital buying trends. Our inability to
adequately respond to these risks and uncertainties or successfully maintain and expand our digital
business could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. COVID-19 has adversely affected
the George Clothing and George Home businesses as consumer discretionary spending decreased.

We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete successfully against existing or
future competitors. Intense pressures from our competitors, our inability to adapt effectively and quickly to
a changing competitive landscape or a failure to effectively execute our model to retain and win customers
in our targeted customer categories, could reduce demand for our merchandise, decrease our inventory
turnover, cause us to take greater markdowns and negatively affect our sales and margins.

**_The efficiency of our supply chain is critical to our business and operations. Significant_**
**_disruptions in our production and/or distribution, particularly for perishable goods, could_**
**_materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

We are subject to risks associated with delivery of products to our customers through our hub and
spoke logistics model and our delivery fleet, which operates predominantly by road, but also by deep sea
freight and air. We operate with tailored logistics structures concentrated in a relatively small number of
distribution facilities to supply and deliver our products. There is a risk that any of these facilities may be
materially adversely affected by extraordinary events, such as a fire or an explosion. In some such cases,
insurance is subject to limitations and therefore may not cover all of our losses. See "—We may incur
_liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to significant financial risks if our_
_insurance coverage proves to be inadequate." Any increases in the cost of transportation, including as a_
result of increased fuel prices or environmental regulations or initiatives that mandate more costly methods
of transport, could significantly increase our cost of doing business. The efficiency and functioning of our
supply chain without disruptions or delays is essential, especially for our fresh food products. Changes in
our logistics structures, including as a result of impacts to our facilities, labour disruptions, fleet problems,
natural events, technical disruptions, malfeasance or accidents, could lead to a temporary or extended
disruption of our operations, disrupt product availability and inventory management and have a negative
impact on our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the
growth of our business is subject to limitations on the capacity of our current supply chain network and our
ability to expand that network to meet our changing needs. Our failure to grow our supply chain network
in line with the growth of our business could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition,
results of operations and prospects. See also "—The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European
_Union may lead to increased costs and potential staff shortages, adverse currency impacts and increased_
_regulatory burden."_

**_We rely on certain suppliers and partners, some of which are third parties, and any failure by these_**
**_suppliers and partners to comply with obligations could have a materially adverse impact our_**
**_brand, reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition and our agreements with_**
**_these suppliers and partners may be subject to adjustments that could increase our expenses._**

We have business relations with more than 17,560 supplier accounts, excluding one-time vendor
accounts, and more than 4,420 active suppliers as of November 2020, including in relation to our ownbrand products. See "Business—Our Suppliers and Logistics." In addition to IPL, we are also dependent
on certain third-party suppliers for our products, which exposes us to risks that such suppliers may fail to
meet timelines, provide us with sufficient inventory or comply with our specifications. If a delay or
interruption of delivery were to occur either temporarily or permanently for any reason, we may not be able
to meet customer demand, which may result in fewer sales and may harm our brand. Further, as we
require our suppliers to meet certain specifications and standards to ensure the quality of our products,
the use of third-party suppliers increases the demands on our quality control personnel. If the products
provided by our suppliers do not meet the relevant quality standards, our reputation may be materially
adversely affected. In addition, we depend on certain of our suppliers for certain of our successful popular
own-brand products which contribute to store traffic and sales. Any disruption of delivery of these key highvolume products may have a material adverse effect on our sales. Further, the associated reputational
risks are heightened in the context of suppliers who supply and/or manufacture our own-brand products.
See also "—Any events that negatively impact the reputation of, or value associated with, our brands could
_materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and prospects."_

There can be no guarantee that we will not be required to make changes to our supplier base, and at
any point may be required to contract with other suppliers on less favourable terms and/or at a greater
cost. While we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, and alternate suppliers are
generally available, we do not have long-term contracts with all of our suppliers. As a result, certain of our
suppliers could increase their prices or fail to deliver sufficient quantities to us in a timely fashion or at all.

### 87


-----

There is also a risk that suppliers will consolidate, giving us fewer choices and creating pricing pressure.
Any deterioration in our relationships with our suppliers, the imposition of stricter conditions by suppliers
(especially with respect to stringent payment terms or as a result of the willingness of credit insurers to
reduce the exposure of our suppliers) or the non-renewal of our key supply agreements may have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we experience a
need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that additional suppliers will be available
when required on terms acceptable to us. In addition, even if we were able to find new suppliers on
acceptable terms, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it would
take to train such suppliers in our methods, products, quality control standards, employment, health and
safety standards.

Our operations are dependent on a number of key supplier relationships, including IPL. While IPL is
wholly-owned by ASDA, any interruption to IPL's operations could materially adversely affect our business,
financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, we are dependent on suppliers of the
machinery used within our hub and spoke facilities for their continued supply and maintenance. We are
also dependent on other third parties, including landlords and distributors, and other suppliers. If any such
suppliers ceased operations or was temporarily unable to supply its respective services, this could
materially adversely affect our operations or financial condition until an alternative supplier is found, and
there could be no guarantee that any alternative supplier would be as satisfactory as the existing
arrangements. Any adverse changes to our relationships with these suppliers and third parties or in a
reduction in availability or level of service offered by these suppliers and third party providers could restrict
our ability to conduct our business and thereby adversely impact our financial condition and prospects.

Our relationship with suppliers based in foreign markets presents certain risks. For example, if such
suppliers are non-compliant with labour laws on manufacturing and the values listed in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work,
we could be subject to action from international trade unions with whom we have no day to day relationship.
There is also a risk that our suppliers may not comply with relevant anti-corruption laws, health and safety
laws, environmental laws or other laws and regulations, which could result in reputational damage to
ASDA's brand, loss of consumer trust or human rights or anti-corruption law investigations of ASDA. In
addition to non-compliance with international or domestic labour, health and safety laws or environmental
laws, we face a variety of risks generally associated with sourcing products from suppliers in foreign
markets, including, among others, political instability; increased security requirements applicable to foreign
goods; the imposition of taxes, duties, other charges and restrictions on imports; currency and exchange
rate risks; risks related to environmental matters or other issues in the foreign countries or factories in
which our products are manufactured; delays in shipping; and increased costs of transportation. Any of
these risks, in isolation or in combination, could materially adversely affect our reputation, financial
condition and results of operations.

**_Increased transportation costs or disruption to transportation services could materially adversely_**
**_impact our business, results of operations and financial condition._**

Cost-effective transportation of our products is an important element of our cost structure. We depend
on the use of refrigerated trailers for the shipping of certain of our products from our suppliers' facilities to
our distribution centres, from our distribution centres to our stores and from our stores and distribution
centres to our customers. ASDA drivers deliver goods to stores and customers using a fleet of leased
tractors, trailers and vans, as well as occasional spot-hire or third-party hauliers. See "Business—Our
_Suppliers and Logistics." Transportation costs have historically fluctuated significantly over time, in_
particular in connection with oil prices, and increases in transportation costs could result in reduced profits.
Additionally, climate change related taxes and levies are a large portion of the energy related costs
required to maintain the cold chain. These climate change related taxes have been increasing in recent
years and are expected to increase in the future.

An impairment or loss of one or more distribution centres due to accidents, fires, technical disruptions,
sabotage or other events, or an impairment or disruption in IPL's or other suppliers' service, including
significant price increases, could result in a temporary disruption in the delivery of products to our stores
and additional costs. Although we believe that we would be able to find an alternative distribution centre
or an alternative operator, if necessary, we may be unable to find alternative providers in a timely fashion,
on reasonable terms, or at all. We also require last-mile transport for our delivery services, which is one
of the most expensive parts of the transportation process. Changes in these agreements governing the
relationships with these providers could also result in reduced profits. Any increases in the cost of
transportation, and any disruption to our transportation and logistics systems, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

**_We may not be able to keep pace with new technological developments in the online grocery_**
**_business._**

Consumer expectations regarding the use of digital tools and omni-channel shopping are rapidly
evolving, with customers seeking to patronise retailers that offer technological solutions that reduce
shopping and checkout times. One of our objectives is to use digital tools to enhance the in-store
experience from product selection to checkout and further develop the omni-channel retail experience we
offer our customers. We rely in part on third parties for development of and access to such new
technologies and tools. We expect that new services and technologies will continue to emerge. These new
services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies that we currently use.
Incorporating new technologies into our products and services may require substantial expenditures and
take considerable time, and ultimately may not be successful. In addition, our ability to adopt new services
and develop new technologies may be inhibited by industry-wide standards, new laws and regulations, or
third parties' intellectual property rights. Our success will depend on our ability to develop new technologies
and adapt to new technological changes and evolving industry standards.

**_We face certain risks in relation to our online presence, which is a rapidly evolving part of our_**
**_operations, including as regards data privacy, security breaches, hacking and vandalism._**

Our online channels, which are increasingly important to our business and continue to grow in
complexity and scope, and the systems on which they run, are regularly subject to cyberattacks. Those
attacks involve attempts to gain unauthorised access to our websites and mobile applications to obtain
and misuse customers' information, including payment information. Such attacks, if successful, in addition
to potential data misuse, may also create denials of service or otherwise disable, degrade or sabotage
one or more of our online platforms, which may significantly disrupt our customers' shopping experience.
If we are unable to maintain the security of our digital platforms and keep them operating within acceptable
parameters, we could suffer sanction, loss of sales, reductions in transactions, reputational damage and
deterioration of our competitive position and incur liability for any damage to customers or others whose
personal or confidential information is unlawfully obtained and misused, any of which events could have a
material adverse impact on our business and results of operations and impede the execution of our
strategy or the growth of our business.

The UK online grocery industry is still developing and rapidly evolving. Our online grocery operations
must, therefore, be considered in light of the risks and difficulties we encounter operating in an industry
that is still evolving. These risks and difficulties include:

  - managing rapid growth in personnel and operations;

  - developing sufficient management and technology capability in a rapidly evolving industry;

  - managing and further developing a complex business system;

  - capital expenditures associated with the development of our online operations and support
functions;

  - risks surrounding online payments;

  - further development to our infrastructure and technology solutions;

  - maintaining our profit margins if consumer preferences shift overall to prefer online sales over
brick-and-mortar store sales; and

  - accurately predicting future capacity requirements and ability to maintain or grow market share.

Furthermore, we may be affected by an increase in governmental regulation of the internet and/or
online retail. The application or modification of existing laws or regulations, or adoption of new laws and
regulations governing the internet and online retail operations could materially adversely affect the manner
in which we currently conduct our online business. The legislative framework governing the internet
remains largely unsettled, even in areas where there has been some legislative action. In addition, the
growth and development of the market for online retail may lead to more stringent customer protection
laws that may impose additional burdens on us, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and prospects.

We may be subject to privacy or data protection failures, including in respect of the General Data
Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (the "GDPR") through the Data Protection Act 2018. We collect,
process and utilise personal data from customers, business contacts, colleagues and other third-parties,
marketing initiatives and the large number of credit and debit transactions we process, and the failure to
adequately maintain and protect such information, or failure to comply with applicable data protection laws,

including by providing adequate privacy notices to our online users, ensuring lawful use of the data,
fulfilling rights requests and maintaining consents, could have a material adverse effect on our brand,
reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. See also "—We collect and
_process personal data in our daily business, and the leakage of such data may violate law and could_
_materially adversely affect our business."_

We rely on third-party service providers to process customer payments made using bank cards and
credit cards. Our online operations depend heavily upon the secure transmission of confidential
information over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. The use and handling of this
personal information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding laws and regulations at the subnational, national and international level, as well as by certain third-party contracts. The legal and
regulatory frameworks governing the use and handling of personal information are relatively new and are
still evolving. If we or any of our third-party service providers fail to store, transmit and purge customer
information in a secure or otherwise compliant manner, if our security and information systems are
compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, a cyberattack or a network security incident, or if our
colleagues or certain third-parties fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations (and, as a result,
information about our customers or colleagues is obtained by unauthorised persons and/or used
inappropriately), we could be subject to liabilities and penalties, damage to our reputation, litigation or
government enforcement actions, substantial costs and a loss of customer confidence, all of which may
significantly adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We rely extensively on information systems to process transactions, summarise results and_**
**_manage our business. These systems are interdependent and disruptions in the IT infrastructure_**
**_that we use could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial_**
**_condition._**

We rely on an extensive array of information systems (including servers, networks, applications,
websites and databases) that are essential to the operation and management of our activities. The
development, implementation and continuous and uninterrupted performance of our hardware, network,
applications, website and other systems, including those which may be provided by third parties, are
important factors in our delivery of products and services to our customers. We are dependent on our
technical infrastructure and computer applications for all aspects of the day-to-day management of our
business, including purchasing, sourcing, distribution, online sales, customer delivery, data exploitation,
invoicing, cash collection, reporting and consolidation, as well as electronic data exchange and access to
internal information, all of which provide necessary information upon which management makes its
business decisions.

Our performance depends on accurate, timely information and numerical data from key software
applications to aid day-to-day business and decision-making processes. We are exposed to operational
risks, such as the breakdown or failure of equipment, interruption of power supplies or processes, fires,
floods or other natural disasters, acts of sabotage or vandalism, and industrial accidents. We rely on our
information technology systems for communication among our suppliers, stores, distribution centres and
headquarters and for our online sales. We may be adversely affected if our controls fail to detect or contain
operational risks. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain
the proper technology infrastructure and to maintain the related automated and manual control processes,
we could be subject to adverse effects, including billing and collection errors, business disruptions and
damages related to security breaches. Any disruption caused by failings in our information technology
infrastructure or underlying equipment or of communication networks could delay or otherwise impact our
day-to-day business and decision-making processes and negatively impact our performance.

We currently rely on Walmart for a material portion of our technology services. We will continue to
depend on Walmart and other third-parties to maintain and develop IT systems for our use after the
Separation. See also "Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation
_of ASDA from Walmart" and "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional_
_Agreements with Walmart."_ If such providers were to terminate their agreements with us or stop providing
services to us for any reason, or if such providers were to considerably raise the price of their services,
our business would be materially and adversely affected. Some of these providers are small companies
and their long-term financial viability cannot be assured. We cannot guarantee you that we will be able to
find and retain alternative providers or acquire the rights to intellectual property important to our operations
if our current or future providers become financially unstable. To the extent any of these systems,
technologies or programmes do not function properly and we cannot find and retain a suitable IT provider
to help remedy the fault, we may experience material adverse effects on our business that require
substantial additional investments to remedy, or which we may not be able to remedy at all. The
performance of the IT systems that we use depends on, among other things, our ability to effectively

safeguard such IT systems and related equipment against damage or compromise from interruptions to
telecommunication services, data breaches, hacking and phishing attempts and the introduction of
malware and computer viruses.

Delays or interruptions in the delivery of our products could result from unknown data, software or
hardware defects, insufficient capacity or the failure of our website hosting, mobile applications and
telecommunications vendors to provide continuous and uninterrupted service. Any significant breakdown
of plant or equipment, accidents, such as a serious flood, fire and other natural disasters, or other
significant disruption to the operations of our primary sites for all of our computer and communications
systems could significantly affect our ability to manage our information technology systems. Our
equipment and technology systems also require ongoing maintenance, refinement, updating and may also
require replacement with more advanced equipment or systems in the future. If we are unable to maintain
more advanced equipment or systems in the future or upgrade our IT system regularly, we may experience
difficulties with the adoption of new technology and systems into our existing operations. Furthermore,
disruptions to operations or interruptions in operations involving such systems may occur in the future.
Any material disruption or slowdown of our equipment or technology systems, including those caused by
our failure to successfully upgrade our equipment or systems, could have a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure protection against unauthorised
attempts to access the IT systems that we use, including malicious third-party applications that may
interfere with or exploit security flaws in our products and services.

We rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide the security necessary to effect the
secure transmission of information from our customers, such as credit or debit card numbers (although as
part of our Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards ("PCI-DSS") compliance we do not store this
data but use third-party payment providers). At the same time, we increasingly rely on cloud computing
and other technologies that result in third parties holding significant amounts of ASDA and customer
information on our behalf. We cannot guarantee absolute protection against unauthorised attempts to
access our or these third parties' IT systems, including third party applications that may interfere with or
exploit security flaws in our or these third parties' products and services. Viruses, worms and other
malicious software programmes could, among other things, jeopardise the security of information stored
in a user's computer or in our or these third parties' computer systems, affect the availability of our or these
third parties' computer systems or attempt to change the internet experience of users by interfering with
our ability to connect with users. In addition, in the past, we have also experienced system intrusion
attempts through non-cyber means, including through fraudulent phone calls. We have seen an increase
over the past several years in the frequency and sophistication of attempts to compromise the security of
the types of IT and other systems we use. If any compromise in our security measures, or those of the
third parties we rely on (including our suppliers) were to occur and our, or their, efforts to combat such a
breach are unsuccessful, our reputation may be harmed leading to a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and prospects.

Any failure of such IT systems due to a technical issue or a cyberattack, and any failure of our IT
systems' support teams to mitigate such IT system failures, could have a material adverse effect on our
business operations and assets. For example, any such failure could impact on the availability of electronic
point of sale (EPOS) systems and therefore limit our ability to complete sales. Moreover, a failure that
causes our websites to become unavailable could materially adversely affect online product viewing
opportunities and sales. If any compromise in our security measures were to occur and our efforts to
combat such a breach were unsuccessful, our operations would be interrupted and our reputation could
be harmed, leading to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations.

**_Our use of open source software may restrict our ability to exploit our proprietary software and IT_**
**_systems and exposes us to certain risks._**

Our key proprietary software and critical IT systems incorporate significant elements of "open source"
software, our use of which is subject to the terms of applicable licences. Open source software is typically
licensed for use at no initial charge on terms which allow modification and distribution of the software by
the licensee. However, licence terms may impose on the user compliance requirements and obligations
to disclose modifications we have made to the software to third parties. Our ability to realise fully the
commercial benefits of any such software may be restricted because:

  - open source licences may be drafted in legally ambiguous language and may result in
unanticipated consequences or obligations regarding our software;

  - due to the requirements to licence modified software, our competitors or licensees may have
access to information which may help them to develop competitive products;

### 91


-----

  - open source software is available to the public for anyone to access and utilise, including our
competitors; and

  - it may be difficult for us to identify accurately the developers of the open source code (who may
be licensors of the software) and whether the licensed software infringes third party intellectual
property rights.

Furthermore, to the extent we use open source software we face certain more general risks which apply
to any organisation making use of such software. Our use of GNU General Public Licence ("GPL")
software could subject certain portions of our proprietary software to GPL requirements, including an
obligation on us to disclose that software to third parties and to permit them to use the software free of
charge. Finally, open source licences typically present onerous compliance requirements and failure to
observe these may result in litigation or the loss of the right to use the software which may have an adverse
effect on our financial condition and future prospects. Although we are not aware that we have breached
any of these compliance requirements, and to our knowledge no third party has claimed that software
owned by us should be made available on an open source basis, any of the risks or restrictions relating to
open source software mentioned above could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and future
prospects.

**_If the technology-based systems that give our customers the ability to shop with us online do not_**
**_function effectively, our results of operations, as well as our ability to grow our omni-channel_**
**_business, could be materially adversely affected._**

Increasingly, customers are using computers, tablets, and smart phones to shop with us and with our
competitors and to do comparison shopping. We use our websites, social media, online advertising, and
email campaigns to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience.
As a part of our omni-channel strategy, we offer home delivery and pickup options under which many
products available for purchase online can be picked up in-store by the customer via our Click & Collect
offer, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores. Omni-channel retailing is a rapidly evolving
part of the UK retail grocery industry. We must anticipate and meet our customers' changing expectations
while adjusting for technology investments and developments in our competitors' operations through
focusing on the building and delivery of a seamless shopping experience across all channels. Any failure
on our part to provide attractive, user-friendly secure digital platforms that offer a wide assortment of
merchandise at competitive prices and with low-cost and rapid delivery options and that continually meet
the changing expectations of online shoppers and developments in online and digital platform
merchandising and related technology could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of
online and other sales, harm our reputation with customers, have a material adverse impact on the growth
of our online business and have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.

**_Use of social media may adversely impact our reputation or subject us to fines or other penalties._**

There has been a marked increase in the use of social media platforms and similar devices, including
blogs, social media websites and other forms of internet-based communications which allow individual
access to a broad audience of customers and other interested persons. Consumers value readily available
information concerning retailers, manufacturers and their goods and services and often act on such
information without further investigation, authentication and without regard to its accuracy. The availability
of information on social media platforms and devices is virtually immediate as is its impact. Social media
platforms and devices immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often
without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of
information, including inaccurate information, is virtually limitless. Information concerning or affecting us
may be posted on such platforms and devices at any time. Information posted may be inaccurate and
adverse to us, and it may harm our business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an
opportunity for redress or correction. Such platforms also could be used for the dissemination of trade
secret information or compromise of other valuable company assets, any of which could harm our
business.

We also use social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain Instagram, Facebook
and Twitter accounts. As laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and
devices, the failure by us, our colleagues or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws
and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business or subject
us to fines or other penalties.

**_We may suffer a loss as a result of operational risk, including human error, ineffective or_**
**_inadequate designed processes, failure of IT or other systems, improper conduct by colleagues_**
**_and third parties, failures by suppliers and third-party providers and criminal activity including_**
**_fraud, theft and cybercrime._**

Any failure to maintain the security of the information relating to our business, customers, and
colleagues, whether as a result of cybersecurity attacks on our information systems or otherwise, could
damage our reputation, result in litigation or other legal actions against us, cause us to incur substantial
additional costs, and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In the ordinary course of our business, we are exposed to the risk of theft or misappropriation of funds
and products and to the risk of fraud and corruption in our stores and warehouses, as well as human error.
For example, from time to time, products may be misappropriated during transportation or we may
experience a misappropriation of funds in our stores or at other levels of our business. We cannot assure
that incidences of inventory loss and theft will not increase in the future, that insurance will cover such
losses adequately or that the measures we are taking against such theft will effectively decrease inventory
shrinkage. In addition to increasing security costs to combat inventory theft, the occurrence of such risks
may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and reputation.

**_We rent certain of our properties pursuant to commercial leases that may be subject to_**
**_adjustments that could increase expenses and have a materially adverse impact on our business,_**
**_results of operations and financial condition._**

Certain of our stores and warehouses are leased pursuant to commercial leases for fixed terms
consistent with market practice. Such leases usually provide for regular rent reviews, at which time our
rental costs may increase in line with certain indices. Our ability to maintain our existing rental rates during
renewals or to renew any expired lease on favourable terms will depend on many factors which are not
within our control, such as applicable real estate laws and regulations, payments for utilities, local taxes
or assessments, conditions in the local real estate market, competition for desirable properties and our
relationships with current and prospective landlords. If rent reviews were to increase at higher rates than
currently anticipated or if we were unable to renew any expired leases on commercially favourable terms,
our financial performance could be adversely impacted.

Further, we may be unable to extend expiring lease agreements at all or may have no or limited ability
to close certain store locations that do not meet our financial targets or are no longer consistent with our
brands' positioning. These changes in the size of our store network can have a significant impact on our
revenues and expenses from one period to the next, which affect the comparability of our results during
these periods. Our ability to enter into leases to open new retail locations depends on the availability of
locations that meet our criteria for traffic, square footage, lease economics, demographics and other
factors. In addition, the market for suitable retail locations is highly competitive. Some of our competitors
may have the ability to negotiate more favourable commercial lease terms than we can.

If we are unable to renew our lease agreements as they expire or if any of our existing lease
agreements are terminated for any reason and we are unable to secure other favourable locations on
acceptable terms, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results
of operations. See also "—We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates
_made or procedures followed in the third-party brokers' opinions of pricing of our portfolio of real estate_
_assets are correct, accurate or complete."_

**_A significant disruption in our workforce or the workforce of our suppliers or a failure to extend,_**
**_renew or renegotiate trade union agreements could lead to labour disputes that might interfere_**
**_with our operations or otherwise could materially adversely impact our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

As of December 31, 2019, we employed 144,951 colleagues. Approximately 124,491 of these
colleagues worked in our store network and 12,662 in our distribution network. From time to time, and in
particular in our distribution networks, we may experience labour disputes and we can never rule out the
possibility of work stoppages. We are also exposed to similar risks involving the workforce of our thirdparty suppliers, including all of our distribution centre operators. In particular, a labour stoppage or other
interruption at one of our suppliers or distribution centres would impact our ability to supply our stores or
online orders and could have a pronounced effect on our operations as a result. As we do not directly
control our suppliers, we have limited information on labour relations between our suppliers and their
workforces.

### 93


-----

In addition, some of our colleagues are members of trade unions and are parties to collective bargaining
agreements, which contain provisions covering issues such as working hours and compensation. See
"Business—Our Colleagues." We may not be able to extend existing agreements, renew them on their
current terms or, negotiate such agreements in a favourable and timely manner or without work stoppages,
strikes or similar industrial actions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. If
we seek to reduce colleague terms, or otherwise are unable to maintain satisfactory colleague and labour
relations, the results could include work stoppages, strikes or other industrial action or labour difficulties
(including higher labour costs), any of which could materially adversely affect our operations. As a result,
any deterioration in our relationships with our colleagues, unions and other colleague representatives
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

From time to time disagreements and other disputes may emerge with our workforce and/or their
representatives and we are presently engaged in ordinary course litigation regarding dismissals, overtime
work and other routine disputes or actions. See "Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation."

We cannot assure you that a future labour disturbance, work stoppage, or failure to attract and retain
operative personnel at any of our stores, depots or our suppliers' facilities in the United Kingdom or
elsewhere would not have a material adverse effect on such store's or facility's operations and, potentially,
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Our failure to attract and retain qualified colleagues, increases in labour costs and social charges_**
**_and other changes to wage regulations could materially adversely affect our business, results of_**
**_operations and financial condition._**

We are reliant on our staff for the management, operation, creation, maintenance, repair and upgrading
of our business, operations and systems. Our ability to recruit or adequately replace, retain and motivate
suitably qualified and experienced staff is important for our ongoing success. It may in the future become
more difficult for us to recruit or retain such members of staff and the UK labour market may become more
competitive. An inability to recruit and retain sufficient personnel of the right calibre or the incurring of
significant costs in order to do so may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and future
prospects. Furthermore, our automated warehouses and delivery trucks still require intensive labour.
Colleague benefits (which include wages, National Insurance contributions and other payments) currently
represent one of our most significant cost items, accounting for a substantial portion of our total expenses.
Consequently, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to manage our labour costs and
control their impact on our margins. We may in the future be forced to raise our wages due to changes in
market conditions, new labour laws and regulations, collective bargaining with our recognised trade unions
or general wage increases across the industry or in any particular region in which we operate.

For instance, given the high proportion of our colleagues who are hourly paid, future increases or
changes to the National Minimum Wage legislation, the National Living Wage or other hourly wage
legislation or regulations could have an impact on our future financial success. As of April 2020, the
National Living Wage increased from £8.21 per hour to £8.72 per hour from April 2019. The National Living
Wage will increase in increments with a target to be set by the UK government of reaching two-thirds of
median earnings by 2024. As of October 2020, the UK government has not set out a projected pathway
to the 2024 target, given the uncertainty about the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. We must comply
with such legislation. Any failure to comply could result in criminal prosecution with any party found to be
guilty of deliberate non-compliance being subject to disqualification as a company director for up to
15 years. From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings in connection with the wages we pay:
see "Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation."

As national minimum hourly wage rates increase, we may be required to increase not only the wage
rates of our hourly paid colleagues but also the wages of our salaried managers as an increase in hourly
rates inevitably erodes the pay gap between hourly paid and first line managers. This makes it more
challenging to incentivise our most talented colleagues to progress into management positions. It also
makes it difficult to retain our talented managers. Although difficult to predict with certainty, these higher
salaried costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. While we cannot be certain how
this will affect our business, an increase in the minimum wage rate paid to certain workers will increase
our labour costs which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to meet our management labour needs, while controlling wage and labour-related costs, is
subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of and competition for qualified persons in
the local markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing pay rates,
changing demographics, and changes in employment and labour laws. Such laws related to hours, wages,
job classification and benefits could significantly increase operating costs.

### 94


-----

If we fail to maintain our competitive position on pay and benefits, the quality of our workforce could
decline, causing our customer service to suffer, while increasing wages for our colleagues could cause
our profit margins to decrease. If we are unable to hire, retain, and train colleagues capable of meeting
our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet
our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates may have a material adverse effect on our
financial condition and prospects.

Furthermore, we are required to pay social security, National Insurance contributions, pension
contributions and other similar charges for our colleagues. These may increase over time or the laws and
regulations setting forth any exonerations or other exemptions from payment of such charges from which
we currently benefit may change, increasing our liabilities.

We maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that cover current and former
colleagues pursuant to which, with respect to defined benefit plans, the participants receive defined
payment amounts regardless of the value or investment performance of the assets held by such plans
and, with respect to defined contribution plans, the employer, employee or both make contributions on a
regular basis to such plans. Deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial
downturn or otherwise, could cause an increase in the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension
plans, thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans, which in turn would reduce the
cash available for other business needs or for capital expenditures. Our main defined benefit pension plan,
the ASDA Group Pension Scheme ("ASDA Group Pension Scheme"), benefits from a bulk purchase
annuity policy issued by Rothesay Life plc. The policy covers all known members of the scheme and all
known benefit liabilities, subject to certain exclusions. If Rothesay Life were to get into financial difficulty
and default on its payment obligations under the policy, or if any of the excluded liabilities were to
crystallise, this could result in a requirement for us to make further, material contributions to the ASDA
Group Pension Scheme. Future contributions to our defined benefit pension plans could reduce the cash
otherwise available to operate our business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of
operations. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
_Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Information—ASDA Group Pension_
_Scheme Buy-In."_

Any of the foregoing may affect our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to pass on such higher costs to our
customers, these higher labour costs could materially adversely affect our profitability.

**_Our intellectual property rights may be infringed or challenged. Intellectual property claims by third_**
**_parties or our failure or inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value_**
**_of our brand and weaken our competitive position._**

We own or use a variety of trade names, logos, domain names, service marks and trade marks in our
business and rely on trade mark and copyright laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions
to protect our intellectual proprietary rights. We may not have adequate protections for our intellectual
property rights or may be accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties. We cannot be
certain that third parties will not infringe, misappropriate or terminate these rights. We own nearly all the
intellectual property rights over the trade marks, trade signs and copyrights that we use. We also own
some of the intellectual property rights over the software and technologies that we use. However, such
use may be challenged by third parties. If we are unable to protect and maintain our own intellectual
property rights or our use of the intellectual property rights owned by others, or we are unable to renew
our intellectual property rights when they expire, the value of our brands could be diminished and our
competitive position could weaken.

We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorised use of our proprietary
rights. Third parties that licence our proprietary rights may also take actions that diminish the value of our
proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of
financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may
not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary
rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent
or superior technology or other intellectual property rights.

In addition, our products, services, websites or acts conducted in the ordinary course of our business
may violate, or be perceived to violate, intellectual property rights of third parties (in particular, copyrights,
trade marks, design rights, patents and software) and we may be subject to infringement claims. We may
also be involved in claims raised by third parties against our suppliers. For example, we may be involved
in claims regarding products or services supplied by our suppliers that are perceived as infringing
intellectual property rights of third parties.

### 95


-----

Third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us as we expand our business to include
new services and continue to develop our online channel. We may also face claims from our suppliers if
they consider that their intellectual property rights are being misused, especially where those suppliers
have a strong brand image and reputation. Our defence of any claim, regardless of its merit, could be
expensive and time consuming, and could divert management resources. Successful infringement claims
against us could result in significant monetary liability and prevent us from selling some of our products
and/or services. In addition, the resolution of claims may require us to abandon the sale or provision of the
litigious product or service, redesign our own private-label products or acquire licence rights from third
parties, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_Robbery, shop crime and fraud in our stores may adversely affect us._**

We have been the target of robberies, burglaries, theft, fraud, embezzlement by our colleagues and
other forms of crime. Despite our efforts to reduce our exposure to such crimes, for instance through
security guards or security cameras on our sites, we expect to continue to be exposed to such crimes and
new forms of crime. There can be no assurance that our current or future efforts to counteract crimes will
be effective or that the cost of such efforts will not increase. Further, any crime we become victim of may
give rise to litigation and related costs, including reputational costs and the costs linked to the diversion of
the attention from our management team from day-to-day operations of our business. A single significant
incident of fraud, or increases in the overall level of fraud, may be sufficient to result in significant
reputational damage to us or could lead to the imposition of regulatory sanctions. Our inability to control
and reduce robberies, whether intentional or not, burglaries, fraud, embezzlement or other forms of crime
in a cost effective manner could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,
liquidity, results of operations and prospects.

**_Certain activities of our business are seasonal or cyclical in nature, and our revenue, working_**
**_capital requirements and results of operations may vary from quarter to quarter as a result._**

Our sales, profits, working capital requirements and cash flows within any given year have historically
been affected by seasonal fluctuations. For example, sales volumes have historically been higher in
December in the run-up to the holiday season and historically lower in February. In addition, sales of
certain of our products have historically been higher during the summer tourist season. These seasonal
influences have a direct impact on our earnings, and fluctuations in our inventory or store closings during
these peak periods could affect our working capital requirements. If seasonal fluctuations are greater than
anticipated, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. Our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of other factors,
including the timing of new store openings, temporary or definitive closings or disposals, and the revenue
contributed by new stores or the loss of revenue from closed or sold stores. For these reasons, sequential
quarterly comparisons may not be a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the
future. For a further discussion of the impact of seasonality on our business, see "Management's
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting the_
_Comparability of Our Financial Information—Seasonality of Our Results of Operations."_

**_We are exposed to payments risks, including processing risks, increases in transaction fees,_**
**_actions taken by third parties that could disrupt our operations, failure by us or third parties on_**
**_whom we rely to fully comply with rules and standards governing payment processing, and system_**
**_failures and security breaches._**

We are reliant on electronic payment methods. We accept payments using credit and debit cards, gift
cards, contactless, PayPal, Android Pay and Apple Pay. As we offer new payment options to customers,
we and our customers may be increasingly exposed to fraud (although fraud is not currently a significant
concern). For existing and future payment options we offer our customers, we may become subject to
additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement enhanced
authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our payments
products). We pay interchange and other fees for these card payments, which may increase over time and
raise operating costs and lower margins. Interchange fees on Visa and MasterCard are regulated and are
therefore currently subject to an effective minimum amount, which is beyond our control. Interchange fees
on American Express payments are negotiated with American Express on an arm's-length basis. We rely
on third parties to provide payment processing services, and it could disrupt our operations if these
companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services. We are also subject to payment card
association operating rules, certification requirements, PCI-DSS and rules governing electronic funds
transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted, making them difficult or impossible to comply with. If we
fail to comply with these rules or requirements, we may be subject to fines and/or higher transaction fees
and, in extreme cases, may lose our ability to accept payments from customers, process electronic funds

transfers or facilitate other types of online payments. See also "—We rely extensively on information
_systems to process transactions, summarise results and manage our business. These systems are_
_interdependent and disruptions in the IT infrastructure that we use could materially adversely affect our_
_business, results of operations and financial condition."_

Any failure of our payment processing systems, whether caused by a systems failure or otherwise, will
adversely affect our income in the short-term and may result in us losing customers which may have a
material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects. In addition, there can be no assurance
that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or
developments will not result in a compromise or breach of the processes we use to protect customer
transaction data. If any such compromise or breach were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect
on our reputation, business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.

In certain circumstances, our contract with our payment card acquirer and American Express generally
require us to adhere to payment card network rules which could make us liable to payment card issuers
and others if information in connection with payment cards and payment card transactions that we process
is compromised. In such cases, resulting liabilities could be substantial.

**_We may from time to time pursue acquisitions, which may prove more costly than anticipated and_**
**_may not generate anticipated synergies and which may have an adverse impact on our business,_**
**_as could our failure to successfully integrate such businesses following acquisition. Our business_**
**_could also be negatively impacted by merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by_**
**_supranational and national laws and regulations._**

We have in the past acquired and may in the future from time to time acquire other companies or
businesses. Pursuing future acquisitions depends on, among other things, identifying suitable acquisition
or investment opportunities and successfully completing those transactions. Acquisitions involve
numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including difficulties in integrating the technologies,
operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company; difficulties in supporting and
transitioning vendors, if any, of an acquired company; diversion of financial and management resources
from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities; failure to realise the anticipated benefits
or synergies of a transaction; failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or
challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property,
regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or colleague or
customer issues; risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience; potential loss
of key colleagues, customers and suppliers from either our current business or an acquired company's
business; inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs; additional costs associated
with funding the acquisition; and possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses.
Furthermore, acquisitions of businesses outside of our markets may present additional challenges due to
cultural and linguistic differences and the difficulties presented by integrating and managing a business
that is geographically more remote. Our ability to integrate and manage acquired businesses effectively
and to handle any future growth will depend upon a number of factors, and failure to manage growth
effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, the growth of our business to date, and our future growth, has placed and is expected to
continue to place significant demands on our management and operational and financial infrastructure.
Managing growth has in the past and will in the future continue to require significant expenditure and
allocation of management resources, as well as an expansion in headcount. If we fail to achieve the
necessary level of efficiency as we continue to grow, there could be a material adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and results of operations. See also "—We depend on the services of key
_executives, and our business and growth strategy could be materially adversely impacted if we were to_
_lose these executives and were unable to replace them with executives of equal experience and_
_capabilities."_

Acquisitions may also increase our indebtedness, both through debt incurred to finance the acquisition
and existing indebtedness of the acquired company, which could make it more difficult to incur additional
indebtedness. Any increase in indebtedness in connection with an acquisition may have a material adverse
effect on us. See "Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—We may
_incur additional debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt, including the Notes,_
_and impact our ability to operate our businesses."_

Moreover, merger control rules and antitrust limitations imposed by national laws and regulations could
negatively impact our business if such laws and regulations prevent us from expanding our growth through
the consummation of mergers or acquisitions in certain categories or oblige us to divest certain stores or
activities that may have an impact on our market shares in some geographical areas. At the same time, if

### 97

smaller players in our markets are able to consolidate, this could increase the competitive pressure on our
business due to an increase in such competitors' economies of scale and a reduction in their operating
costs. Moreover, our competitors might acquire smaller players in our markets, further strengthening their
position in the market. These events could cause our business, financial condition and results of operations
to be materially and adversely affected.

**_We depend on the services of key executives, and our business and growth strategy could be_**
**_materially adversely impacted if we were to lose these executives and were unable to replace them_**
**_with executives of equal experience and capabilities._**

We rely on our key executives as one of our major competitive strengths. Our success depends, in
part, upon the continued services of our executive management team and our highly qualified managers
to operate our business and execute our strategies. Our executives' and managers' knowledge of the
market, our businesses and our company represents a key strength of our business model. The success
of our business strategy and our future growth also depend on our ability to attract, train, retain and
motivate skilled colleagues, managerial, sales, administration, development and operating personnel.
There can be no assurance that any of our key personnel will continue to be employed by us or that we
will be able to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future. The loss of a significant number of our
key leaders who are in critical roles, or the failure to attract additional key personnel, could have a material
adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. This could also result in
additional duties for the remaining members of management, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Increased criminal sophistication to facilitate human trafficking and modern slavery may lead to_**
**_our business operations being infiltrated and abused more often for the illegal purpose of_**
**_exploiting vulnerable individuals._**

Because of our dependency on cross-continental goods transport and the type of operations such as
food packaging manufacturing that are well-documented targets for exploitation schemes by criminals,
there is a risk that criminals will continue to attempt to conduct their exploitative schemes undetected within
our supply chain or business operations. We have dealt with occasional incidents of modern slavery and
human trafficking in recent years, and we believe that these criminal acts in general across any business
sector in the United Kingdom will continue to exist and possibly increase. If we are unable to identify, act
and remediate third party criminal acts quickly then, despite not having acted illegally ourselves, there is
a significant risk of negative publicity.

**Risks Relating to ASDA Pharmacy and ASDA Opticians**

**_Certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services, and our insurance may not be adequate_**
**_to cover any claims against us._**

We currently operate 254 pharmacies and, as a result, we are exposed to risks inherent in the
packaging, dispensing, distribution and disposal of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, such
as risks of liability for products which cause harm to customers, as well as increased regulatory risks and
related costs. We cannot guarantee that the coverage limits under our insurance programmes will be
adequate to protect us against future claims, or that we will be able to maintain this insurance on
acceptable terms in the future, or at all. Our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows may be
materially adversely affected if in the future our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate or
unavailable, or there is an increase in the liability for which we self-insure, or we suffer harm to our
reputation as a result of an error or omission.

We are subject to numerous government regulations. Each of our in-store pharmacies must be
registered with the General Pharmaceutical Council. Additionally, before a registered pharmacy can
dispense prescriptions under the National Health Service, it must be included in the pharmaceutical list
relating to a Health and Wellbeing Board Area, maintained by NHS England, NHS Scotland or NHS Wales.
In addition, pharmacies dispensing controlled substances are required to maintain records of sale and
supply and report incidents to the NHS. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we
could be in breach of professional standards and/or NHS terms of service, which could lead to a hierarchy
of penalties up to and including the loss of such pharmacy's registration. Each pharmacy therefore has a
responsible pharmacist to ensure it operates in a safe and legal manner and corporate-wide this
responsibility is shared by the Superintendent Pharmacist.

Application of laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or
illegality, or could require us to make changes to our operations. In addition, we cannot predict the impact
of future legislation and regulatory changes on our pharmacy business or assure that we will be able to
obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals required to operate our business.

**_Changes in results of our pharmacy business could materially adversely affect overall results._**

A majority of our retail pharmacy revenue is generated by filling prescriptions for which we receive
payment from the NHS. We also generate revenue through providing NHS services, private services and
the sale of over the counter P Medicines.

Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: changes in NHS
reimbursement for prescription drugs; a reduction in the pharmacy global sum leading to reduced retained
purchase margins available for pharmacy in England; a reduction in dispensing activity payments; the
introduction of new NHS services; and a move away from reimbursement for dispensing prescription
drugs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations, including online; overall economic
conditions; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the
pharmaceutical industry, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy
business.

If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted
for any reason, we would in turn have to seek a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals, with related risks
of shortages or delays in our own pharmacy operations. Any such disruption could cause reputational
damage and result in a number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other
pharmacies. One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of prescriptions we
dispense, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the revenue and gross
margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store selling opportunities and, in turn, affect our
overall revenue, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.

**_Certain risks are inherent in providing optometry services, and our insurance may not be adequate_**
**_to cover any claims against us._**

We currently operate Opticians in 156 stores and in all four nations of the United Kingdom. We also
have an online site supplying contact lenses under "General Direction." The majority of our revenue is
from the sale of spectacles and eye examinations.

We are regulated by the General Optical Council ("GOC"). To operate in the United Kingdom and use
the title "Opticians" we have to be registered as a Body Corporate with the GOC and therefore are subject
to the GOC Business Standards as well as the Opticians Act 1989. It is a requirement of the GOC that any
Body Corporates which do not have GOC registrants as the majority of their Board, must have a
Responsible Officer (Superintendent Optometrist) in position. All Optometrists and Opticians also have to
be registered with the GOC to be able to practice and they are subject to the GOC Professional Standards
as well as the Opticians Act 1989. Breaches to the GOC standards could lead to warnings, fines, sanctions
on practice up to being removed from the GOC register either as a business or individual and unable to
practice.

All of our optical departments also hold a contract with the NHS local area team or Health Board to be
able to provide NHS services. Breaches of the terms within such contracts can lead to penalties, including
up to revoking such contract and stopping us providing NHS services. These penalties can occur at the
store level, regional level or national level. Since 67% of our eye examinations in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland and 100% of our eye examinations in Scotland were funded by the NHS in 2020, any
penalties or stoppage in NHS services would have a material adverse impact on our business.

Our Optometrists in all four nations also have to be registered on an NHS performer's listing to be able
to provide NHS eye examinations. In England, some of our stores also conduct additional NHS services
which are commissioned at a local level, which requires such stores to abide by additional NHS standard
contracts with local service level agreements.

Changes in the regulatory environment for the optical industry and other changes in laws, rules, NHS
contract terms and regulations may also have an effect on our operating and commercial model.

The provision of professional eye care services entails an inherent risk of professional malpractice and
other similar claims. We may become subject to professional malpractice regulatory or NHS actions or
claims under various theories relating to the professional services provided by our departments. This could
also lead to a public relations and/or reputational risk both at the local and national level. We may not be
able to continue to obtain adequate liability insurance at reasonable rates, in which event, the cost could
require us to exit this offering, as insurance is a regulatory requirement for both a Body Corporate and
individual registrants. Furthermore, our insurance may not be adequate to cover claims asserted against
us, thus, potentially decreasing our future cash position.

If the glazing supply provided by of our main Optical vendor was to be disrupted for any reason, our
Optical operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could transfer to a new glazing

manufacturer. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a number of our Optical
customers transferring their purchases to other Opticians. This may adversely affect the volumes of
glasses we dispense, our cost of sales associated with our Optical operations, and the revenue and gross
margin of those operations.

**Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters**

**_From time to time we and/or our management are subject to claims that can result in litigation,_**
**_arbitration, tax or regulatory proceedings which could distract management from our business_**
**_activities and result in significant liability._**

We may be subject to legal and regulatory enquiries or investigations, both civil and criminal, that could
divert management time and resources and result in fines, sanctions, variation or revocation of
permissions and authorisations, as well as reputational damage. For example, from time to time, we and/or
our management are involved in litigation, tax audits, claims and other proceedings related to the conduct
of our business, including, but not limited to, claims from our current and former employees, claims of
intellectual property infringement, claims from customers (such as for injuries at our premises), claims
asserting unfair competition and unfair business practices by third parties and environmental, health and
safety claims (including, for example, related to the presence of asbestos in any of our properties). We
could face a wide variety of employee claims, including general discrimination, privacy, labour and
employment and disability claims.

ASL is a defendant in over 40,000 equal value claims (the "Equal Value Claims") that began in 2008
and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the
United Kingdom on behalf of current and former ASDA store employees, and further claims may be
asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in ASDA's retail stores
is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees
working in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job
positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in
warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants
are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities
and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.

In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could
compare their positions in ASDA's retail stores with those of employees in ASDA's warehouse and
distribution facilities. ASDA appealed the ruling and the oral argument was held before the Supreme Court
of the United Kingdom in July 2020. We are awaiting a decision.

Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will
determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by
employees in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities.

At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably
estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, we can provide no
assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and any losses that may arise from these
proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. See "Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation."

Any claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory proceedings being
brought against us by various governmental agencies. Often these cases raise complex factual.
accounting and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require
significant management time and legal expenses. Litigation and claims and regulatory proceedings against
us or our management could result in unexpected expenses and liability and could also materially
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we were successful in
defending such proceedings, we could still suffer from the distraction of management resources to such
proceedings, incur certain expenses and possibly face harm to our reputation from case-related publicity.
The involvement in litigation and arbitration proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our
business, results of operations and financial condition. See "Business—Legal Proceedings."

**_We are subject to extensive, increasingly stringent and frequently changing laws and regulations_**
**_and increased scrutiny from regulators and enforcement authorities, including in relation to_**
**_advertising, food and product safety, health and safety matters and the environment, and both_**
**_compliance and non-compliance therewith could impose substantial liabilities and costs and have_**
**_a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations._**

In the ordinary course of our business, our operations and properties are subject to increasingly
stringent laws and regulations relating to, among other things, labour, competition, imports and exports,
advertising, customer protection, alcohol and tobacco licencing, supplier relations, planning approvals for
the opening of new stores, business operations, product safety, intermediation in customer credit and
insurance, information technology, store safety and accessibility and health, safety and environment.
Moreover, some of our businesses are subject to specific regulations, compliance with each of which can
be complex and costly or can result in significant cash outflows. These include compliance with marketing
laws and regulations, compliance with pharmaceutical laws and regulations, compliance with optometry
laws and regulations, compliance with e-commerce laws and regulations and compliance with real estate
laws and regulations. Additionally, we are subject to, among other things: telecommunications regulation,
both directly and indirectly; regulations that govern our relationships with our suppliers, limiting our
operational flexibility; and labour and employment laws that regulate the human resources implications of
any proposals to restructure our business, our colleagues' working conditions, maximum working hours
and, in certain jurisdictions, the ability to have stores open 24 hours a day or work on Sundays. We may
be subject to audits and/or inquiries into our labour law practices by competent authorities and
enforcement costs and penalties can be significant.

For example, we are subject to the Groceries Supply Code of Practice ("GSCOP"), a statute governing
the largest UK food retailers which requires these retailers to treat their suppliers fairly, lawfully and in
good faith. The proposed fines for breaching the legislation may be up to 1% of the breaching retailer's
turnover. Even if no fines are assessed, a finding of breach by the Groceries Code Adjudicator responsible
for enforcing the GSCOP may cause negative publicity and damage our image, reputation or brand, which
could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, we are subject to the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 (the
"Controlled Land Order"), which is legislation administered by the CMA and designed to limit the ability
of large grocery retailers to prevent land being used by their competitors for grocery retailing in the future.

We purchase our electricity on a wholesale basis via a dedicated subsidiary, which sells electricity back
into ASDA. These electricity purchases are regulated by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets
("OFGEM"), which is the government regulator for gas and electricity markets in Great Britain. In addition,
we are subject to regulation by the Office of Communications ("OFCOM"), an independent regulator and
competition authority for the UK communications industries, which regulates selling practices for mobile
telecommunication services and changes to mobile termination rates, among other things.

The FCA is responsible for the regulation of insurance and customer credit-related activities in the
United Kingdom. Firms carrying on such activities in the United Kingdom must generally be authorised by
the FCA with appropriate permissions, and FCA authorised firms are subject to ongoing regulation and
supervision by the FCA. In connection with distributing the ASDA Money suite of white-labelled financial
services products, ASL is authorised by the FCA with limited permission to carry out credit broking, and
both ASL and ASDA Financial Services Limited are registered with the FCA as introducer appointed
representatives of a number of third party insurance and credit product providers. Any failures in or
inadequate controls around the customer introduction process for those regulated financial services
products, or any technical deficiencies in the arrangements with such third party insurance and credit
product providers, could in principle result in regulatory investigations and related costs and penalties, as
well as reputational damage.

Additionally, as a retailer and manufacturer of food products for human consumption, we are subject to
stringent production, packing, health, quality, labelling and distribution standards. Each of our stores and
our suppliers' facilities may be subject to licencing, reporting requirements and official quality controls by
numerous governmental authorities. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain the necessary licences or
approvals could delay or prevent the development or operation of a given retail location or distribution
centre. Our stores and our distribution centres are subject to regular inspection by authorities for
compliance with hygiene regulations applicable to the sale, storage and manufacturing of foodstuffs and
the traceability of genetically modified organisms, meats and other raw materials. Should any noncompliance with such regulations be discovered during an inspection, authorities may temporarily shut
down the store, distribution centre or facility concerned and/or result in prosecution and the imposition of
a fine for such non-compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition and results of operations.

### 101


-----

Further, we are subject to various environmental and health and safety requirements, including those
governing discharges to water and air, waste disposal, the clean-up of contaminated sites, product content
and labelling and worker health and safety. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up
obligations, fines, penalties and other criminal and civil sanctions, and third-party claims for personal injury
or property damage, as a result of violations of our liabilities under these requirements. For example, we
own and operate service stations, which include significant storage of petrol or other hazardous materials,
and many of our sites store fuel for use in backup generators and, as a result, we are subject to a variety
of legislation governing the use, management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes and
other regulated materials, such as petroleum and petroleum products, and any environmental impacts
from current or historical operations at such locations. Our operations and facilities also require permits
and authorisations under environmental, health and safety requirements, which are subject to renewal,
modification and rescission by issuing authorities. We also may be required to incur substantial capital or
other costs to comply with such requirements or those that are promulgated in the future.

In addition, we could be sued for health problems caused by the use of tobacco products. In fact,
various health related legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution,
manufacturing, development, advertising and marketing of cigarettes have been brought against vendors
of tobacco products in the United States. If this trend progressed to the United Kingdom, any unfavourable
verdict against us in a health-related suit could adversely affect our business, financial condition and
results of operations.

From time to time, we may be notified of or otherwise become aware of additional laws and regulations
that governmental organisations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. Compliance
with future requirements could result in substantial costs to us. Failure to comply with any such laws or
regulations could subject us to sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial
condition or results of operations. Future changes in such laws and regulations could also have a material
adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.

The laws and regulations to which we are subject frequently change, which may materially impact our
business operations, and our failure to comply with such laws can result in significant fines and other
penalties. See also "—The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union may lead to increased
_costs and potential staff shortages, adverse currency impacts and increased regulatory burden." As a_
general matter, legal requirements are subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate
cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. Failure to define clear roles
and responsibilities or to regularly communicate with and train our colleagues may result in noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. As is the case for other retailers of our size, we may from
time to time be subject to inquiries or investigations from regulatory bodies by local authorities, competition
authorities or financial regulators, in the ordinary course of our business. Such authorities may take the
view that we have not conducted or are not conducting our business fully in compliance with applicable
laws and regulations and, consequently, we may be required to make significant expenditures to defend
against allegations of wrongdoing or modify our business practices to comply with differing interpretations
of existing laws and regulations or with future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and
materially limit our ability to operate our business.

For a further discussion of the material regulatory regimes with which we must comply, see "Business—
_Regulation."_

**_We collect and process personal data in our daily business, and the leakage of such data may_**
**_violate law and could materially adversely affect our business._**

We are subject to regulations regarding the use of personal data. In the ordinary course of our business,
we collect, process and in some cases store certain personal financial and other information about our
customers and colleagues (some of which may be sensitive, such as information about customers' dietary
preferences or restrictions), marketing initiatives and the large number of credit and debit transactions we
process. We also process sensitive information about our colleagues, including their bank details, union
membership and health status. We must therefore comply with strict data protection, privacy and security
laws and regulatory guidance. In order for our business to function successfully, we must process personal
data, including credit and debit card information in an adequately secure manner. In addition, our online
operations depend heavily upon the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks,
including the use of cashless payments. We rely on third-party service providers to process customer
payments made using bank cards and credit cards. See also "—We are exposed to payments risks,
_including processing risks, increases in transaction fees, actions taken by third parties that could disrupt_
_our operations, failure by us or third parties on whom we rely to fully comply with rules and standards_
_governing payment processing, and system failures and security breaches."_

### 102


-----

The use and handling of this personal information is regulated by evolving and increasingly demanding
laws and regulations at the national and international levels, as well as by certain third party contracts.
The legal and regulatory frameworks governing the use and handling of personal information are relatively
new in our markets, and are still evolving. Any failure or perceived failure by us or any of our third-party
service providers to comply with our policies or with any other privacy related laws, regulations, industry
self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we
may be subject or other legal obligations could materially adversely affect our reputation and brands and
may result in claims, fines (including by card merchants), civil or criminal proceedings or actions against
us by governmental entities or others. For example, we are subject to the GDPR which became applicable
on May 25, 2018. The GDPR strengthens existing rights, provides for new rights and gives customers and
colleagues increased control over their personal data, including the requirement for data collectors to
process and use personal information solely for the reasons for which they were collected. Laws, such as
the GDPR, restrict our ability to collect and use personal information relating to individuals including the
use of that information for marketing purposes. We rely on our own colleagues to maintain our databases
and seek to ensure that procedures are in place to ensure compliance (including that we maintain proper
privacy notices). Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in a possible fine of up to either EUR
20,000,000 or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher,
for the most serious infringements. See also "—We may suffer a loss as a result of operational risk,
_including human error, ineffective or inadequate designed processes, failure of IT or other systems,_
_improper conduct by colleagues and third parties, failures by suppliers and third-party providers and_
_criminal activity including fraud, theft and cybercrime."_

Moreover, even if we are compliant with such laws and requirements, we may not be able to prevent
security breaches involving customer transaction data. If we or any of our third-party service providers fail
to transmit customer information in a secure manner, if our security and information systems are
compromised as a result of data corruption or loss, a cyberattack or a network security incident, or if our
colleagues or certain third-parties fail to comply with data protection laws and regulations (and, as a result,
information about our customers and colleagues is obtained by unauthorised persons or used
inappropriately), we may be subject to the aforementioned consequences, all of which may significantly
adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection, customer protection and the digital advertising
business are evolving and subject to potentially different interpretations in different jurisdictions. Changes
in these laws and regulations or their interpretations may force us to incur substantial costs or require us
to change our business practices and may present challenges to our ability to collect customer data and
promote our sites, product offerings and services through electronic communication.

**_We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to significant_**
**_financial risks if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate._**

We are exposed to risks that are inherent to our business operations and currently maintain insurance
we believe is customary for businesses of our size and type and in the markets in which we operate. For
a description of our material insurance policies, see "Business—Insurance." Given the number of locations
and settings in which our colleagues provide services and the range of activities our colleagues engage
in, we may not always be able to foresee accurately all activities and situations in order to ensure that they
are fully covered by the terms of our insurance policies and, as a result, we may not be covered by
insurance in specific instances. While we seek to maintain appropriate levels of insurance, not all risks are
insured or insurable. As a result, we cannot guarantee our insurance programmes will be adequate to
cover future claims or operating losses incurred as a result of accidents resulting from fires, explosions,
water damage, theft, political unrest, natural events causing damage to our property (buildings, furniture,
equipment, merchandise or computer systems) or following a business interruption at our premises, nor
that we will be able to maintain our insurance programmes on acceptable terms in the future.

We typically renew our insurance on an annual basis. In connection with this renewal process, our
insurance costs may increase following the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for
damages, in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases
in the insurance market in general. The occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for
damages in a calendar year may have a material adverse effect on our insurance premiums. If we are not
able to maintain our current insurance coverage or do so at a reasonable cost or if our insurance coverage
proves to be inadequate or unavailable in the future, our business, financial condition and results of
operations may be materially adversely affected.

Our insurance coverage may not cover all risks, such as risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,
and there are some risks that may only be covered to a limited extent due to limits in our insurance policies.
For instance, we may incur losses that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically

reasonable to insure. Unanticipated changes in the actuarial assumptions and management estimates
underlying our reserves for such losses could result in significantly higher expense than anticipated, which
could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also "—
_Certain risks are inherent in providing optometry services, and our insurance may not be adequate to_
_cover any claims against us" and "—Certain risks are inherent in providing pharmacy services, and our_
_insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims against us."_

**_The international scope of the George Clothing business may subject us to additional legislative,_**
**_judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to_**
**_the countries or regions in which we sell and deliver products, which could materially adversely_**
**_affect our business or financial performance._**

In addition to our UK operations, George Clothing products are available for sale internationally through
a third-party supplier. Our future results of operations from international sales of the George Clothing
products could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These
factors include stability of the third-party supplier, political conditions, including political instability, local
and global economic conditions, legal and regulatory constraints (such as direct marketing, regulation of
product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on
online and retail operations in international markets), restrictive governmental actions (such as trade
protection measures), local product safety and environmental laws, tax regulations, local labour laws, antimoney laundering laws and regulations, trade policies, currency regulations, laws and regulations
regarding customer and data protection, and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we
operate, now or in the future.

Additionally, following the Separation, pursuant to the TMA, Walmart is expected to grant us a licence
to continue to use the George brand within the United Kingdom (for sale, marketing and distribution
purposes on an exclusive basis) and outside the United Kingdom in certain specified countries in Europe
(on a non-exclusive basis) where ASDA has been using the George brand prior to the date of the
Acquisition Agreement (and is expected to grant us a licence to use the George brand (on a non-exclusive
basis) in certain other territories outside the United Kingdom and such specified European countries in
substantially the same way and to the same extent as the brand was used by ASDA immediately prior to
the date of the Acquisition Agreement, as specified in, and subject to the terms of, the TMA), in each case
on and subject to the terms of the TMA. The TMA is expected to restrict ASDA from using the George
brand (and other Licensed IP (as defined in "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—
_Trade Mark Agreement")) following Completion other than in accordance with the licences granted under_
the TMA and is expected to contain certain covenants and undertakings from ASL, including as regards
ASDA's use of the George brand (and other Licensed IP); see "Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions—Trade Mark Agreement." As referred to in "Certain Relationships and Related Party_
_Transactions—Trade Mark Agreement," Walmart will have a right to terminate the TMA under certain_
circumstances, including for material breach of the TMA by ASDA or repeated non-material breaches of
the TMA by ASDA. ASDA will also indemnify the Walmart Group for losses arising out of ASDA's use of
the Licensed IP (including the George brand) in material breach of the TMA. Violating the TMA with
Walmart could lead to Walmart exercising its right to terminate the TMA and the licence to ASDA of the
George brand, and ASDA therefore ceasing to have the right to use the George brand, as well as to
potential claims by Walmart against ASDA for breach of the TMA. See also "—Our intellectual property
_rights may be infringed or challenged. Intellectual property claims by third parties or our failure or inability_
_to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brand and weaken our competitive_
_position."_

**_We are exposed to the risk of violations of anti-corruption laws, sanctions or other similar_**
**_regulations._**

We must comply with certain anti-corruption laws or other similar regulations. We operate in certain
parts of the world that lack a developed legal system or have experienced widespread corruption. Under
some circumstances, strict compliance with anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and
practices. Our internal policies mandate compliance with these laws, but we cannot ensure that our internal
control policies and procedures will always protect us from acts committed by our associated persons.

Violations of such laws can result in civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges,
injunctions, interdicts, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts, termination of existing
contracts, revocations or restrictions of licences, criminal fines or imprisonment. In addition, such violations
could also negatively impact our reputation and consequently, our ability to retain existing customers and
attract new customers. On the other hand, any such violation by our competitors, if undetected, could give
them an unfair competitive advantage. The consequences that we may suffer due to the foregoing could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

### 104

**_Changes in tax rates or laws, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could affect future results._**

We are subject to complex tax laws in the United Kingdom and has historically been subject to
international tax laws in connection with international sales of the George Clothing and George Home
products. Changes in (or changes in interpretations of) tax treaties, tax laws or regulations or tax authority
guidance could materially adversely affect our tax position, including our effective tax rate or tax payments,
possibly with a retroactive effect. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of
factors in addition to our results of operations, accounting standards and changes in accounting standards,
and future changes in the law. If our tax positions are challenged by relevant tax authorities, the imposition
of additional taxes could require us to pay taxes that we currently do not collect or pay or increase the
costs of our services to track and collect such taxes, which could increase our costs of operations or our
effective tax rate and have a negative effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
For example, in the United Kingdom, if the tax authority concluded that VAT was chargeable on a particular
product on which we did not charge VAT to customers, we would be subject to account for such VAT. The
occurrence of any of the foregoing tax risks could have a material adverse effect on ASDA's business,
financial condition and results of operations.

In the jurisdictions in which we operate, governments might centrally adjust the value of business rates
in the property market. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the government adjusts the value of business
rates to reflect changes in the property market approximately every five years. The most recent revaluation
came into effect in England, Scotland and Wales on April 1, 2017 (based on rateable values from
April 1, 2015). At revaluation, all properties are given a new rateable value which, depending on the
underlying movement in the value of the property, can have an adverse impact on the tax liability due on
the property. Adjustments of the business rates could result in increased costs and consequently could
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and
prospects.

**_Tax disputes, tax audits and adverse decisions rendered by tax authorities may expose us to_**
**_substantial tax liabilities which could materially impact our business and reputation._**

Tax authorities, such as HMRC, periodically examine our activities. We often rely on generally available
interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations, including interpretations made by the relevant tax
authorities and courts of law. Although we believe that we have adequately assessed and accounted for
our potential tax liabilities, and that our tax estimates are reasonable, there cannot be certainty that the
relevant tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretation of these laws, nor, as the case may be,
that such tax authorities or courts will not depart from their prior criteria.

As with any purchase of a company, there may be historical tax questions on which views have been
taken or disputes may have arisen or may arise, which if unfavourably determined may require us to pay
settlement amounts, interest, fees or penalties, which may adversely impact our business, financial
condition and results of operations. To the extent that any such tax liabilities arise, we should have the
benefit of a Walmart guaranteed indemnity contained in the Acquisition Agreement, subject to any
conditions, limitations and exclusions contained therein.

**Risks Relating to Financial, Reporting and Other Matters**

**_The audit reports of Ernst & Young LLP included in this Offering Memorandum include statements_**
**_purporting to limit the persons that may rely on such reports and the opinions contained therein._**

The audit reports of Ernst & Young LLP for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, which
are included in this Offering Memorandum, include a statement, in accordance with guidance issued by
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, that Ernst & Young LLP does not assume
responsibility to anyone (including holders of Notes) other than the Company and the Company's members
as a body, for its audit work, audit reports or opinions it has formed. Ernst & Young LLP has undertaken
its audit work, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, to state to the
Company's members those matters that it is required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no
other purpose.

Investors in the Notes should understand that these statements are intended to disclaim any liability to
parties (such as purchasers of the Notes) other than to the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to
those reports. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement
or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in
a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the
limitation above, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditors based
on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent
to which auditors have responsibility or liability to third parties is unclear under the laws of many

### 105


-----

jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, and the legal effect of these statements in the audit reports is
untested in the context of an offering of securities. The inclusion of the language referred to above,
however, may limit the ability of holders of the Notes to bring any action against our auditors for damages
arising out of an investment in the Notes.

**_We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures_**
**_followed in the third-party brokers' opinions of pricing of our portfolio of real estate assets are_**
**_correct, accurate or complete._**

This Offering Memorandum refers to the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing with respect to the real estate
portfolio owned by ASDA. Opinions of pricing of property (including those used in the Brokers' Opinions of
Pricing) are prepared on the basis of various assumptions, estimates and projections. In particular, the
Brokers' Opinions of Pricing were produced without visual inspection of ASDA's properties and are thus
based on information provided by management and certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, the
assumptions that (i) in the case of Newsteer, the properties are let to ASL and in the case of Colliers, the
properties are let to ASDA or to a AAA-tenant, which could include ASDA, and in both cases that ASDA
is in the market for all the properties and benefits from an excellent rating, such as AAA and a very low
risk of failure, (ii) all properties are freehold or long leasehold and all title, tenure, lettings, planning,
taxation, statutory and local authority requirements are complied with and all properties possess a good
and marketable title free from any onerous restrictions or conditions, (iii) all properties benefit from full
access and egress rights together with parking and loading facilities and are connected to all main
services, (iv) all properties are free from defect, in good repair and condition and well maintained and in
marketable condition, compliant with all building, accessibility and fire safety regulations and there are no
abnormalities as to repair and condition of the properties, (v) the properties have no environmental issues
such as contamination, deleterious materials, flooding, ground conditions, invasive or protected plants or
species and the properties are not adversely affected by any existed or proposed environmental law, and
(vi) the floor areas provided to Newsteer and Colliers by ASDA comply with the RICS Standards for
measurement (other than those properties which were measured by Colliers as part of separate instruction
and upon which Colliers have relied for the purposes of their opinion on pricing) and (vii) no capital
expenditure is required in respect of the properties. Both Colliers and Newsteer have assumed that each
property is a vacant shell unit which benefits from fully capped off services and no tenant fit-outs or fixtures
and fittings beyond a typical specification with which a vacant shell unit would be let or sold have been
taken into account in the respective broker's opinion of pricing. In addition, during the course of their
engagement, Newsteer and Colliers did not perform site inspections, environmental audit, tests of services
and amenities, investigations or tests as to the condition of the properties. Newsteer and Colliers did not
make planning or permitting inquiries and did not examine deeds, leases or other documents relating to
the title to our properties. The real estate advisers both assumed each property to be used to its respective
authorised use under planning legislation and in accordance with the use registered with the relevant
regulatory agency.

We cannot assure you that the assumptions or projections used, estimates made or procedures
followed in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing are correct, accurate or complete. Newsteer and Colliers
provided their opinions of pricing on the relevant properties as of October 20, 2020 and do not take into
account subsequent events, including the uncertain impacts of COVID-19 after such date. Accordingly,
the information included in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing may not reflect the current physical, economic,
competitive, market or other conditions with respect to the property portfolio. Furthermore, the Brokers'
Opinions of Pricing are addressed to the Issuers only and Newsteer and Colliers have accepted no
responsibility to any third party for the whole or any part of the contents of the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing.

Other appraisers may reach different opinions on pricing of ASDA's property portfolio. Moreover, the
pricing determined in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing could be significantly higher than the amount that
would be obtained from the actual sale of the properties included in the ASDA Property Portfolio, especially
in a distressed or liquidation scenario, in the event of a downturn in the local, regional or national real
estate market, or if the properties are sold on an individual basis. Accordingly, the Brokers' Opinions of
Pricing should not be considered a representation of the actual present or future pricing of ASDA's property
portfolio. The realisable pricing of the applicable property portfolio at any given time will depend on various
factors, including:

    - macroeconomic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere;

    - an economic downturn, including as a result of COVID-19;

    - potential changes to the competitive landscape for grocery retail;

    - capital expenditure requirements;

### 106


-----

    - changes in occupier and investor demand;

    - supply and demand generally affecting pricing;

    - adaptability or obsolescence;

    - regulation (e.g. minimum energy efficiency standards);

    - changes in consumer behaviour and shopping habits, either organic or as a result of any other
event listed above or elsewhere under "Risk Factors;" and

    - other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum.

In addition, we anticipate that the price of ASDA's property portfolio will change over time, and it may
change materially. After the issuance of the Notes, neither third parties nor we will provide holders of the
Notes with revised brokers' opinions of pricing and we expressly disclaim any duty to update such brokers'
opinions of pricing under any circumstance.

**_The unaudited financial data and forward-looking statements included in this Offering_**
**_Memorandum need to be carefully considered and may materially differ from actual results._**

This Offering Memorandum incorporates data for the months of October and November 2020 that are
derived from preliminary financial results and estimates contained in our unaudited management accounts,
which have not been and will not be audited or reviewed in accordance with any generally accepted
auditing standards and are subject to change. The data for the months of October and November 2020
presented in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to be a comprehensive statement of our financial
or operational results for the 12 months ended December 31, 2020 and is based on a number of
assumptions that are subject to inherent uncertainties and risks. As such, you should not place reliance
on them when making an investment decision.

We have included data for the months of October and November 2020 in order to provide information
about our recent performance but this information should be treated with a higher level of caution for
reasons including but not limited to the fact that management accounts are not prepared with the same
level of rigor and are not subject to the same level of management review and scrutiny as interim or yearend financial information. In addition, we prepare our monthly management accounts, including those for
the months of October and November 2020, in accordance with Walmart's accounting policies, which may
differ materially from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and/or IFRS, in accordance with
which we have prepared the Financial Statements and certain other financial information included in this
Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, management accounts may not provide for closing procedures that
are as detailed as those conducted at period or year end. Additionally, management accounts may be
subject to cut-off errors and misallocation of items between months. Further, the impact of COVID-19 may
have further increased the risk of errors or omissions or misstatements in our management accounts due
to the reduced level of resources allocated to their preparation due to homeworking arrangements.

**_We may not have the ability to meet our additional financial and other reporting requirements or_**
**_implement effective systems of internal control and other standards, which may adversely affect_**
**_our business._**

Our internal controls over financial reporting are intended to ensure we maintain accurate records,
promote the accurate and timely reporting of our financial information, maintain adequate control over our
assets, and detect unauthorised acquisition, use or disposition of our assets. Effective internal and
disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to operate successfully
as a business. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal
controls.

Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not
absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system
is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and
other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in
achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. If our internal
controls do not keep pace with the size and sophistication of our businesses and the applicable financial
reporting framework, we may not be able to implement and maintain adequate internal controls. If we fail
to implement and maintain effective internal controls, it could result in material misstatements in our
financial statements or failure to meet our reporting obligations in a timely manner, which may cause a
loss of confidence in our reported financial information which could increase our operating costs and
materially impair our ability to operate our business.

### 107


-----

Moreover, we may acquire companies or assets which we determine to be complementary to our
current business. Such acquired companies or assets may have insufficient systems of internal control, or
otherwise have defects which we do not discover until we begin to integrate these systems of internal
control with ours. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in integrating these systems of internal
control with ours, or that such a task will be within our initial expectations in terms of costs, resources and
time expended.

**_Our long-lived assets, primarily goodwill and store-level assets, may not be fully realisable and are_**
**_subject to periodic testing for impairment, and we may incur significant impairment charges as a_**
**_result._**

Our long-lived assets, primarily goodwill and store-level assets, are subject to periodic testing for
impairment. We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill. Total goodwill, which represents the
difference between the consideration paid plus any non-controlling interest and the acquisition date fair
value of identifiable net assets, was £508.0 million as of September 30, 2020, or 2.8% of our consolidated
total assets on a post-IFRS 16 basis. This represents the current carrying value of goodwill in ASDA Group
Limited prior to any purchase accounting relating to the Acquisition and does not necessarily reflect the
goodwill which will be recorded following the Completion when purchase price accounting will have been
completed in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business Combinations). The value of any goodwill recorded on
our financial statements may not be fully realisable upon sale of all or part of the business or any other
liquidity event.

Goodwill is recorded on the date of acquisition and, in accordance with IFRS, is tested for impairment
annually and whenever there is any indication of impairment. Impairment may result from, among other
things, deterioration in our performance, a decline in expected future cash flows, adverse market
conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, any changes in the key assumptions used
for internal calculations of values in use and a variety of other factors. The amount of any impairment must
be expensed immediately as a charge to our income statement. We can give no assurance that we will
not record any goodwill impairments in the future. Any future impairment of goodwill may result in material
reductions of our income and equity under IFRS.

**Risks Relating to the Transactions**

**_The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact_**
**_recoveries under the Notes._**

The Acquisition was referred by the European Commission to the CMA on December 8, 2020. While
consummation of the Acquisition is expected to take place on or about February 16, 2021, the CMA's
phase 1 review of the Acquisition remains ongoing. There can be no assurance that the Acquisition will be
approved within the expected timeframe, approved at all, or approved subject to conditions.

If in the course of its phase 1 investigation, the CMA considers that the Acquisition may be expected
to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets for goods or services in the
United Kingdom, the CMA may refer the Acquisition for an in-depth phase 2 investigation. It is common
practice in such circumstances to propose remedies to address any concerns identified by the CMA, in
lieu of proceeding with a full phase 2 inquiry. Such remedies may include an undertaking to sell certain
Forecourt Assets, to unaffiliated third parties. In the event we propose remedies to the CMA following their
phase 1 investigation, there can be no assurance that our proposal will be accepted. The CMA may reject
our proposal, require additional divestments or impose terms or other conditions that we may be unable
or unwilling to accept. If we are unable to reach an agreement with the CMA concerning remedies in lieu
of a referral to a phase 2 investigation and the Acquisition is so referred, the CMA Clearance Date could
be significantly delayed.

If we agree to remedies that require divestment of certain Forecourt Assets to unaffiliated third parties,
the price we receive from such a mandated sale may be less than what we would have received in a fully
voluntary sale process. There can be no guarantee that market conditions would be favourable in the
period provided for such sales or that the price we would obtain from buyers in a mandated sale would be
equal to the price that would otherwise be offered as part of a customary sales process. If we agree to
remedies that require divestments but are unable to complete these transactions on acceptable terms in
the time permitted, we would be in breach of our agreement with the CMA, which could result in loss in
control over the divestment process or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on
our business.

If the CMA believes the Acquisition may implicate a material public interest consideration, it is required
to bring the matter to the attention of the UK Secretary of State. Under certain circumstances, the UK
Secretary of State may issue a Public Interest Intervention Notice ("PIIN"), which would allow the UK

### 108


-----

Secretary of State to assume responsibility for review of the Acquisition. If a PIIN is issued in connection
with the Acquisition, the CMA Clearance Date could be delayed.

In the event the CMA refers the Acquisition to a phase 2 investigation, it has broad authority to impose
remedies to address their concerns. In the event the CMA considers that remedies would not address their
concerns, the CMA may decide not to approve the Acquisition. If this were to occur, the entire ASDA Group
would have to be divested to unaffiliated third parties. The price we receive from such a mandated sale
may be less than what we would have received in a fully voluntary sale process. There can be no
guarantee as to the consideration we would obtain from buyers in a mandated sale and, in such an event,
there may be insufficient funds for the Notes to be repaid.

In connection with the CMA's review of the Acquisition, we expect the CMA to issue an IEO shortly
before or immediately after Completion, and we expect the IEO to remain in force until the CMA Clearance
Date. Under the IEO, the ASDA Group business will have to be operated independently so as not to take
any action that could potentially impede the CMA's review and remediation of Acquisition-related
competition concerns. In addition, the IEO will prevent any integration activities, substantive changes to
the organisational structure of the ASDA Group, dispositions of ASDA Group assets and exchanges of
commercially sensitive information between the ASDA Group and the Bellis Group unless we seek and
obtain a derogation from the CMA. As a result of the IEO, the Bellis Group will not be able to exercise de
_facto control over the ASDA Group during the pendency of the CMA investigation. Accordingly, the Issuers_
will not be able direct the ASDA Group to comply with the covenants described in "Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes" and "Description of the Senior Notes" until the CMA Clearance Date, and the ASDA Group_
will have no contractual obligation to comply with those covenants until each of the ASDA Guarantors
accedes to the relevant Indenture. Nevertheless, those covenants will apply to the ASDA Group from the
Issue Date, and any failure to comply with these covenants will constitute a default under the Indentures.
Furthermore, subject to any derogations granted, the IEO's restrictions on the ability to exchange
information with the ASDA Group may limit the support that the Bellis Group may be able to provide to the
ASDA Group and affect our ability to grant and creditors' ability to enforce guarantees and security
interests for so long as the IEO is in force. As a result, there may be a delay in our ability to realise
anticipated synergies. If we fail to abide by the terms of the IEO, the CMA may impose financial penalties
of up to 5% of our total turnover. The CMA may appoint a monitoring trustee to monitor compliance with
the IEO and, if it were ultimately to consider it to be necessary, the CMA may appoint a hold separate
manager to operate the ASDA Group on an arm's-length basis until the CMA Clearance Date.

Furthermore, if the conditions to the release of the Escrowed Proceeds, as more fully described under
"Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Acquisition Agreement; Timing of Completion and Issue Date;
_Escrow of Proceeds" and "Description of the Senior Notes—Acquisition Agreement; Timing of Completion_
_and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds" have not been satisfied on or prior to the Outside Date or in certain_
other circumstances (including at the discretion of Midco, a holding company of the Issuers, subject to
certain conditions), the Notes will be subject to a Special Mandatory Redemption and you may not obtain
the return you expect to receive on the Notes. See "—If the conditions precedent to the release of the
_Escrowed Proceeds are not satisfied, the Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow_
_Accounts may not have sufficient funds to cover such redemption without relying on the Shortfall_
_Agreements" and "—In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the Outside Date,_
_the Issuers will be required to redeem some or all of the Notes, which means that you may not obtain the_
_return you expect on the Notes."_

**_In connection with the Post-Completion Disposals or the in-kind distribution of the Post-_**
**_Completion Disposal Receivables, the Issuers will not be required to comply with the restrictive_**
**_covenants described in the Description of the Senior Secured Notes and the Description of the_**
**_Senior Notes._**

The Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets, the Substitute Retail Assets, the Designated Bank
Accounts and the Post-Completion Disposal Receivables will not be pledged as collateral for the Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Notes or the Senior Facilities and will be exempt from all restrictive covenants
included in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Facilities
Agreement, except to the extent described in "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions" and "Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions." Moreover, the limitation on affiliate transactions_
covenants in the Indentures will expressly allow the Post-Completion Disposals. See "Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions," "Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions" and "The Transactions—The_
_Post-Completion Transactions—Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution_
_Asset Disposal Bridge Facility." Accordingly, the Post-Completion Disposals will not constitute a Restricted_

### 109


-----

Payment for purposes of the limitation on restricted payments covenants in the Indentures nor will they
affect the Issuers' capacities for making Restricted Payments in the future.

**_There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart._**

The Separation is a complex transaction that will require significant management attention and poses
a number of risks, including:

    - a failure to establish or maintain our own information systems;

    - a failure to establish and negotiate new wholesale energy supply agreements;

    - a failure to establish or negotiate new deep sea freight agreements;

    - our inability to renegotiate key contracts previously held at the Walmart level;

    - our inability to renegotiate key insurance policies previously held at the Walmart level;

    - our inability to retain key personnel of ASDA;

    - the incurrence of unexpected expenses and working capital requirements;

    - our inability to achieve our financial and strategic goals, including synergies for the combined
businesses; and

    - difficulty in maintaining internal controls, procedures and policies.

Any of the foregoing obstacles, or a combination of them, could decrease operating profit margins or
increase operating costs in absolute terms and/or as a percentage of revenue, which could in turn
negatively impact our profit for future periods and cash flows.

Following the Acquisition, Walmart will continue to provide a reduced selection of services to ASDA,
including services such as IT and access to innovation and know-how under the TSA and the ASA, for a
transitional period (envisaged to be up to three years from the Acquisition Completion Date in respect of
services under the TSA (although the TSA is expected to allow for services to be provided past this date
subject to an increase in costs under a cost ratchet), and for a period of two years from the Acquisition
Completion Date, in respect of the services under the ASA). ASDA expects that it will be dependent on
these services provided by Walmart, for the duration of the agreements pursuant to which they will be
provided. For more information see "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional
_Agreements with Walmart." At Completion, Walmart will grant ASDA a licence pursuant to the TMA to use_
the George brand within the United Kingdom (for sale, marketing and distribution purposes on an exclusive
basis) and outside the United Kingdom in certain European countries where ASDA has used the George
brand prior to the date of the Acquisition Agreement (on a non-exclusive basis) (and is expected to grant
ASDA a licence to use the George brand in certain other territories outside the United Kingdom and such
specified European countries (on a non-exclusive basis) in substantially the same way and to the same
extent as the brand was used by ASDA immediately prior to the date of the Acquisition Agreement, as
specified in, and subject to the terms of, the TMA), in each case on and subject to the terms of the TMA
(see "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions – Trade Mark Agreement"), while Walmart
will continue to own the brand and retain the ability to use it in all other territories. See "Business—Our
_Intellectual Property."_

We will have ongoing service relationships and agreements with Walmart pursuant to which Walmart
has provided certain services to ASDA in the past. These services include sourcing of clothing and general
merchandise. It is possible that such ongoing service relationships and agreements will be insufficient to
cover our needs as a stand-alone company or that the agreements pursuant to which they are provided
may contain terms and conditions that are not favourable to ASDA or not competitive with alternatives in
the market. In addition, failure by Walmart to perform the services provided for under the service
arrangements and agreements to an acceptable service level or at all may result in operational problems
and increased costs to ASDA. The services to be provided by Walmart after the Acquisition may not
function as efficiently as they did prior to the Acquisition and, in the event any of our service relationships
and agreements with Walmart are terminated, ASDA may find it difficult to find a suitable alternative
supplier of such services in a timely fashion or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

As a result of the commercial deleveraging resulting from the Separation, we may not have the same
ability to negotiate with third-parties and achieve the same or similar terms as under existing agreements
through Walmart. We may have substantially higher costs if we fail to negotiate new agreements on similar
terms or at all.

### 110


-----

In addition, the Acquisition will constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by
ASDA and its subsidiaries. Those counterparties will be entitled to terminate their agreements with us.
Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.

The benefits of the operational improvements that we plan to make following the Acquisition may be
undermined by certain other risks we face in our day-to-day operations, including, among other things, the
loss of key contracts, customers and suppliers and strikes and other industrial actions by our colleagues,
which could result in disruptions to our operations and increased costs. Operational efficiency measures
generally require a significant amount of management attention and resources, which may disrupt or
otherwise have a material adverse effect on our ongoing business operations. These factors may offset
any cost savings we anticipate and which we have included in our _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA._
Consequently, our inability to realise any anticipated cost savings could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operation.

**_The ASDA Group will need to transition to being a standalone company and there are risks_**
**_associated with such a transition._**

The ASDA Group has historically been part of the operations of Walmart, which provided them with
operational, financial, and other support. As a result of the Acquisition, we became a standalone company
and, accordingly, we must develop and implement the systems and infrastructure necessary to support
our current and future business. We cannot assure you that we will make the transition successfully. For
example, historically, certain of our accounting and information technology systems were incorporated in
Walmart's larger operations. There can be no assurance that there will not be errors, delays, or other
related issues resulting from the transition to a standalone company and adjustments to associated
business processes or that we will be able to fix any error or issue. Any such errors or issues could have
a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any delays
in implementing required systems may lead to increased operating expenses.

On the Acquisition Completion Date, ASL and Walmart are expected to enter into the TSA, under
which Walmart is expected to provide certain information technology services to ASDA on a transitional
basis (the "Transitional Services"). The Transitional Services, which Walmart is expected to agree to
provide to support and facilitate our ability to operate on a standalone basis, cover all information
technology services and telecommunication services that were provided to ASDA in the 12 months prior
to the Acquisition Completion Date. Under the TSA, each relevant Transitional Service is expected to be
supplied by Walmart until the earlier of (i) the migration of the relevant service as part of the separation of
ASDA from Walmart, and (ii) the termination of the TSA by Walmart or ASL under certain circumstances
as described under "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with
_Walmart—Transitional Services Agreement." (provided that where ASDA requires any Transitional_
Services to be provided after a three-year long stop date set out in the TSA, the charges for such remaining
Transitional Services under the TSA will be subject to increase pursuant to a cost ratchet). If Walmart
terminates the TSA in accordance with its terms or is unable or unwilling to provide the Transitional
Services as agreed, we may not be able to replace these services at an acceptable price and in a timely
manner, or at all. The Transitional Services include certain IT services which are provided pursuant to
third-party vendor contracts. These services will require the vendor consent to extend the term of the
underlying agreement past the Acquisition Completion Date, and thereafter will have to be renegotiated
with the IT vendor. We may not be able to successfully transition these systems to our standalone
operations in a timely manner, or at all, or may have underestimated the costs required to do so. Any
delays in implementing required functionalities and systems may lead to increased operating expenses.

We will also incur costs in the future that have historically been part of Walmart's larger cost structure,
including costs associated with health and welfare benefits for our colleagues, as well as internal legal,
tax, regulatory and treasury services. In particular, we will need to bear the cost of hiring additional
colleagues to fill any gaps left by the withdrawal of Walmart services. We will incur costs searching for and
hiring individuals to fill the positions, and we may not be able to find qualified candidates at a reasonable
cost, or at all. Additionally, as part of Walmart, we benefited from certain economies of scale, including
with respect to our relationships with our suppliers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain
or build the independent relationships that are necessary for us to continue to benefit from such economies
of scale or operate our business successfully.

Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs to operate as a standalone company will
be consistent on a forward-looking basis. Any failure to transition successfully within the terms of the
applicable Transitional Agreement(s), or to otherwise transition successfully to a standalone company,
may cause us to incur substantial expenses in addition to the anticipated separation costs, and would
have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

### 111


-----

Further, becoming a standalone company will require a significant amount of management's time and
effort, which may divert management's attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to
achieve some or all of the benefits that are expected from becoming a standalone company, or do not
achieve them in the time frame expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

**_We may not be able to consummate the Post-Completion Transactions as quickly as we anticipate,_**
**_or at all, and the manner in which we execute the Post-Completion Transactions may differ from_**
**_what we present in this Offering Memorandum._**

Following the CMA Clearance Date, we intend to transfer the Warehouse Assets, and, to the extent
required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, the Select Retail Assets and certain
Substitute Retail Assets to Propco 2 or an affiliate thereof that is also an obligor in respect of the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. Alternatively, such assets may remain held by the ASDA Group
but continue to be charged in favour of the lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.
Following the date of the Forecourt Business Disposal, we intend to transfer the share capital of Bellis
Select Warehouse Holdings Limited, the direct holding company of Propco 2, to the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower to repay the outstanding balance of the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility Proceeds Loan. See "The Transactions—The Post-Completion Transactions—Warehouse
_and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility."_

Once the Post-Completion Disposals have been completed, we intend to execute the Warehouse Sale
Transactions to fund the repayment of amounts outstanding under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility. When the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has been repaid in full and cancelled, we
expect Topco and its controlled affiliates to contribute such Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail
Assets (to the extent applicable) that any of them hold and an amount equal to any net proceeds received
from the sale of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, Substitute Retail Assets (including
any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds) that remain following repayment in full of the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility to the Group in accordance with the covenants described in "Description of the
_Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Topco Covenant" and "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—_
_Certain Covenants—Topco Covenant." See "The Transactions—The Post-Completion Transactions—_
_Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility."_
Although the firm intention of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower is to refinance the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility using only proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions,
there can be no guarantee that the funds raised from these transactions will be sufficient for this purpose.
If such funds are not sufficient, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower is expected to
supplement the proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions with additional proceeds from the
transfer of some or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the Substitute
Retail Assets in sale transactions with unaffiliated third parties.

The initial maturity date for the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is one year from the
Acquisition Completion Date, and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower has the option
to extend its term by an additional six months at its sole discretion. While we expect the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower or Propco 2, as applicable, will be able to complete the Warehouse Sale
Transactions within that timeframe, changes in market conditions, unanticipated obstacles, weaker than
expected demand or other factors could delay or prevent completion of some or all of these transactions.
If the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower is unable to complete the Warehouse Sale
Transactions on favourable terms before the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility matures, it may
elect to sell some or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the
Substitute Retail Assets rather than accept unfavourable terms for the Warehouse Sale Transactions or
refinance the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility through alternative means.

If the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower or Propco 2, as applicable, elects to sell any
or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, any or all of the Substitute Retail Assets (in
each case subject to the ASDA Leases), these assets will not be contributed back to the Group, and we
will continue to incur expenses related to the ASDA Leases entered into in respect of such Select Retail
Assets and Substitute Retail Assets for the duration of the ASDA Lease. Moreover, the terms of the
relevant sale transactions and the ASDA Leases may constrain our use of any such Select Retail Assets
and Substitute Retail Assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business.

The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower is not a subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or the Senior Notes Issuer, and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower will not be
party to the Indentures. Although the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower and Propco 2
are under common control, we will not be able to directly compel them (or Topco or any of our other
relevant non-controlled affiliates) to comply with the covenants described in "Description of the Senior

_Notes—Certain Covenants—Topco Covenant" and "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Topco Covenant" or direct their negotiations with potential purchasers in connection with the_
Warehouse Sale Transactions or in connection with a sale of any Select Retail Assets or Substitute Retail
Assets (in each case subject to the ASDA Leases). See "—Risk Factors Related to the Group's Structure
_and Financing—The interests of the Group's principal shareholders may conflict with your interests." There_
can be no guarantee that the terms of the Warehouse Sale Transactions or any sale of the Select Retail
Assets or the Substitute Retail Assets (in each case subject to the ASDA Leases) will be as favourable as
the terms we would have negotiated, and this could adversely affect the terms of the ASDA Leases. See
"—Risk Factors Related to the Group's Structure and Financing—The terms and conditions of the ASDA
_Leases are subject to change."_

Under the Forecourt SPA, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has undertaken to sell the share capital of
Acquisition 2 to Bellis Forecourts Limited following the CMA Clearance Date subject to the IEO to be
issued by the CMA ceasing to be in effect and subject to the other terms and conditions set out therein
(including that Acquisition 2 has acquired the Forecourt Business). Pursuant to the separate EG Forecourt
SPA, Property Newco has agreed to sell to Euro Garages Limited the share capital of Holdco (which will
in turn own Bellis Forecourts Limited and therefore the Forecourt Business) promptly upon the closing of
the Forecourt SPA (or in each case the shares in another member of the ASDA Group or another relevant
member of the Bellis Group that (directly or indirectly) holds the Forecourt Business). See "The
_Transactions—The Post-Completion Transactions—Forecourt Disposal." To the extent required, we also_
intend to transfer any Excluded Forecourts by way of Excluded Forecourt Divestments. A number of the
Forecourt Assets owned by ASDA and its subsidiaries are adjacent to, and captured under the same title
as, retail assets such as supermarkets, superstores and supercentres. In order to execute the Forecourt
Business Disposal and any Excluded Forecourt Divestments that may be required, we will separate the
title to such Forecourt Assets from the title to the adjacent retail assets by way of a Forecourt Assets
Separation. We will also have to secure certain easements, servitudes and other rights and permissions
necessary for the Forecourt Assets to function independent from the adjacent retail sites (the "Related
**Rights"). In certain instances, the participation of third parties will be required to secure the Related Rights**
and consent to or satisfy formalities in respect of the separation of the titles, and there can be no assurance
we will be able to persuade these third parties to assist us in a timely manner or at all. In addition, third
parties may have rights over the Forecourt Assets (including rights to acquire and pre-emption rights)
exercisable in the event of a transfer of the Forecourt Assets (whether of the freehold or leasehold interest
and whether of whole or part). In all such cases, the transfer of those Forecourt Assets may be significantly
delayed, prevented in part or prevented entirely. In respect of certain Forecourt Assets which are captured
under the same leasehold title as retail assets, in order to execute the Forecourt Business Disposal and
any Excluded Forecourt Divestments that may be required, we will seek relevant landlord's consent to
either a surrender (or, as applicable, renunciation) of part of the lease comprising the Forecourt Asset and
the re-grant of a lease of the Forecourt Asset or an underlease/sublease of that part of the title comprising
the Forecourt Asset or an assignment (or, as applicable, assignation) of part of the retail asset lease that
comprises the Forecourt Asset. Such leasehold title separation exercise will depend on the terms of the
lease of the relevant retail asset and obtaining landlord's consent which the landlord may be entitled to
withhold entirely or grant subject to compliance with certain conditions. In such cases, the transfer of those
Forecourt Assets may be significantly delayed or prevented entirely.

**_If the conditions precedent to the release of any Escrowed Proceeds are not satisfied or in certain_**
**_other circumstances (including at the discretion of Midco, subject to certain conditions), the_**
**_Issuers will be required to redeem the Notes, but the Escrow Accounts may not have sufficient_**
**_funds to cover such redemption without relying on the Shortfall Agreements._**

Any Escrowed Proceeds will be limited initially to the gross proceeds of the Offering and will not be
sufficient to pay the Special Mandatory Redemption Price, which is equal to 100% of the aggregate issue
price of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to, but excluding, the
Special Mandatory Redemption Date. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Acquisition
_Agreement; Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds" and "Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Acquisition Agreement; Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds."_
Under the terms of the Escrow Agreements, amounts may also be released from the Escrow Accounts
prior to the Acquisition Completion Date to pay accrued interest on the Notes on any interest payment
date occurring prior to the Escrow Release Date. In the event that the Special Mandatory Redemption
Price payable upon any Special Mandatory Redemption exceeds the amount of the Escrowed Proceeds
in the relevant Escrow Accounts, Midco will, for the period up to and including March 31, 2021 (as may be
extended by Midco at its unilateral discretion, on one or more occasions, to a date no later than the Outside
Date, the "Shortfall Agreement Termination Date"), be required to contribute an amount in cash (subject
to an initial cap of £20.0 million, pursuant to the terms of the Shortfall Agreements) expected to equal the

### 113


-----

accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts (if any), in each case owing to the holders of the
Notes from the Issue Date to the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date, pursuant to the Shortfall
Agreements.

Holders of the Notes will not have any direct right to enforce the Shortfall Agreements, and must rely
on the Issuers' respective rights to enforcement under the Shortfall Agreements. There can be no
assurance that the relevant counterparties to the Shortfall Agreements will have sufficient funds to make
this payment, and the Issuers may not have access to the funds necessary to allow them to pay the full
amount of the required redemption price in the event of a Special Mandatory Redemption.

Your decision to invest in the Notes is made at the time of purchase. Changes in the business or
financial position of the ASDA Group, or the terms of the Acquisition, between the Issue Date and the
Escrow Release Date, may have an impact on our creditworthiness, and you will not be able to rescind
your decision to invest in the Notes as a result thereof. See also "—In the event that the Acquisition is not
_consummated on or prior to the Outside Date, the Issuers will be required to redeem some or all of the_
_Notes, which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes."_

**_In the event that the Acquisition is not consummated on or prior to the relevant Shortfall Agreement_**
**_Termination Date or the Outside Date, or in certain other circumstances (including at the discretion_**
**_of Midco, subject to certain conditions), the Issuers will be required to redeem all of the Notes,_**
**_which means that you may not obtain the return you expect on the Notes._**

If the Offering is consummated prior to, and not substantially concurrently with or after, the Acquisition
Completion Date, the gross proceeds of the Offering will be deposited in the Escrow Accounts pending
completion of the Acquisition. If this occurs, in order for the respective Escrowed Proceeds to be released
the terms of each Escrow Agreement require the relevant Issuer to deliver, on a date prior to the Outside
Date, an officer's certificate to the relevant Escrow Agent and the relevant Trustee certifying that there is
no insolvency event of default with respect to the relevant Issuer, and the Acquisition has been
consummated or will be consummated reasonably promptly, and in no event later than two Business Days,
following the Release, in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement as in effect on the date
of this Offering Memorandum (subject to certain exceptions). In addition, under the terms of the Shortfall
Agreements, Midco has only initially committed to contribute an amount in cash (subject to an initial cap
of £20.0 million) expected to equal the accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts (if any), in
each case owing to the holders of the Notes from the Issue Date to the Shortfall Agreement Termination
Date, which will initially be March 31, 2021 (subject to any unilateral extensions of such by Midco in its
sole discretion in accordance with the terms of the Shortfall Agreements). Although we currently expect
the Acquisition and the Release to occur by such date, there is a risk that the Acquisition will not be
completed on or prior to the Outside Date and that the Release will not occur. If the Release does not
occur on or prior to the Outside Date for any reason, if Midco has not elected to extend the initial Shortfall
Agreement Termination Date (or any extension thereof) and the Release has not occurred as at such date
or in certain other circumstances, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required to redeem the Senior
Secured Notes and the Senior Notes Issuer will be required to redeem the Senior Notes pursuant, in each
case, to a Special Mandatory Redemption and holders of the Notes may not obtain the investment return
they expect. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Acquisition Agreement; Timing of Completion
_and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds"" and "Description of the Senior Notes—Acquisition Agreement;_
_Timing of Completion and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds."_

Upon such redemption, you may not be able to reinvest the proceeds from the redemption in an
investment that yields comparable returns. In addition, if you purchase the Notes at a price greater than
the issue price of the Notes, you may suffer a loss on your investment. Although we currently believe that
all conditions to the Acquisition and Release will be satisfied and we expect to consummate the Acquisition
on or before the applicable Shortfall Agreement Termination Date and in any event on the Outside Date,
we cannot assure you that the Acquisition will be consummated on the terms described in this Offering
Memorandum, or that the relevant Issuer will not otherwise have to redeem the Notes. See "—Risks
_Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—If the Notes are redeemed early,_
_an investor may not be able to reinvest such proceeds in a comparable security."_

**_The ASDA Group may have liabilities that are not known to us._**

Before making investments, the Shareholders conduct due diligence that they deem reasonable and
appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment. The objective of the due
diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities, to identify possible risks associated with
that investment, including actual or potential liabilities, and to prepare a framework that may be used from
the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation. In conducting due diligence
in connection with the Acquisition, the Shareholders also relied on resources available to them, including

### 114


-----

public information, information provided by the ASDA Group and its former owners and information
provided by third-party advisers, including in the preparation of this Offering Memorandum. When
conducting due diligence, the Shareholders typically evaluate a number of important business, financial,
tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an
investment. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the
due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when
conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Shareholders must rely
on resources available to them, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some
circumstances, third-party investigations.

The ASDA Group may have liabilities that the Shareholders failed or were unable to discover in the
course of performing due diligence investigations in connection with the Acquisition. Following the
Acquisition, we may learn of additional information about the ASDA Group that adversely affects us, such
as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations.
Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the business
of the ASDA Group, or on the financial condition and results of operations of the ASDA Group and our
ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes.

There can be no assurance that the due diligence undertaken in connection with the Acquisition has
revealed or highlighted all relevant facts necessary or helpful in evaluating the Transactions. Furthermore,
there can be no assurance as to the adequacy or accuracy of information provided during the due diligence
exercise or that such information will be accurate or remain accurate in the period from the conclusion of
the due diligence exercise until Completion. The due diligence process is inherently subjective. If the due
diligence investigation failed to identify or appreciate material information regarding the Acquisition, we
may later be forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify the business plan for the
ASDA Group or incur impairment or other charges. Similarly, the materialisation of certain risks, which
may or may not be identified during due diligence, may lead to a loss of property, loss of value and,
potentially, subsequent contractual and statutory liability to various parties.

**_We may not be able to enforce claims relating to a breach of the warranties or pursuant to certain_**
**_indemnification obligations that ASDA Holdings UK Limited has provided and undertaken under_**
**_the Acquisition Agreement and related transaction documents._**

In connection with the Acquisition, ASDA Holdings UK Limited (the "Seller"), has given certain
customary warranties and undertaken certain customary indemnification obligations in the Acquisition
Agreement and related transaction documentation related to the ASDA Group. Nonetheless, the
Purchaser may not be able to enforce any claims against the Seller relating to breaches of these warranties
or in respect of such indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if the Purchaser is able to eventually
recover any losses resulting from a breach of these warranties or in respect of such obligations, the
Purchaser, and therefore indirectly we, may temporarily be required to bear these losses ourselves.

**_We are susceptible to claims of anti-competitive practices._**

Part of our overall strategy is to be a leader in our business sectors. We may be accused of anticompetitive practices based on our conduct and taking into account our market position. This risk may
increase after the Acquisition as the Shareholders also control other entities involved in the retail industry
in the United Kingdom. Any such claims could materially adversely affect our reputation, potentially result
in legal proceedings that could have an impact on our business, financial condition and results of
operations and require us to divest assets. Such claims could also impair our ability to conduct acquisitions
accretive to our business. Before certain potential future acquisitions can be consummated, we may be
required to seek approvals and consents from regulatory agencies or there may be applicable waiting
periods that will need to expire. We may be unable to obtain such regulatory approvals or consents, or, in
order to obtain them, we may be required to dispose of assets or take other actions that could have the
effect of reducing our return on potential future acquisitions. Even if regulatory authorities do not require
disposals or other actions, the regulatory approval process may have the effect of delaying our ability to
implement potential future acquisitions.

**_We may be unable to achieve some or all of the operational cost improvements and other benefits_**
**_that we expect to realise as a result of the Transactions._**

We believe that, after giving effect to the Transactions, we will be able to, among other matters, better
focus our financial and operational resources on our business, growth profile and strategic priorities,
design and implement corporate strategies and policies targeted to our operational focus and strategic
priorities, streamline our processes and infrastructure to focus on core strengths, implement and maintain
a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs, and more effectively respond to industry dynamics.
However, we may not be able to realise all of the cost savings we expect to achieve. The Shareholders

### 115


-----

have estimated that we will be able to achieve additional annual cost savings by pursuing a number of
improvements identified during diligence. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to
successfully realise the expected benefits of these initiatives or that the costs to achieve these cost savings
will not be higher than anticipated. A variety of risks could cause us not to realise some or all of the
expected benefits. These risks include, among others, higher than expected standalone overhead
expenses, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to such initiatives, increased difficulty, and
cost in establishing ourselves as a standalone company, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time,
unexpected costs associated with operating our business, inability to eliminate duplicative back-office
overhead or redundant selling and general and administrative functions and inability to avoid labour
disruptions in connection with any integration of the foregoing. Our ability to successfully manage
organisational changes is important for our future business success. In particular, our reputation and
results of operations could be harmed if colleague morale, engagement, or productivity decline as a result
of organisational or other changes.

The adjustments to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA annualising the impact of the removal of Walmart
royalties and IT costs and their replacement with new costs under the TSA with Walmart, other
adjustments including the impact of the 2020 leap year and estimated costs relating to ASDA operating
as a standalone group, one-off net impact of costs and benefits associated with COVID-19 and adjustment
for certain anticipated cost savings, EG foodservice partnership synergies, synergies from the roll-out of
the ASDA wholesale convenience business, the EBITDA associated with the Forecourt Assets and the
Excluded Forecourts and the rent associated with the Warehouse Assets and Select Retail Assets should
be treated with caution when making an investment decision. The assumptions we have made with respect
to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA that we present in this Offering Memorandum are based on our current
estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual
results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results,
performance or achievements expressed or implied by such adjusted financial information.

Moreover, our implementation of these initiatives may disrupt our operations and performance, and
our estimated cost savings from these initiatives are based on several assumptions that may prove to be
inaccurate and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we will realise these cost savings. If, for any reason,
the benefits we realise are less than our estimates, or our improvement initiatives adversely affect our
operations or cost more or take longer to implement than we project, or if our assumptions prove
inaccurate, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely
affected. These actions may not provide the expected benefits and could lead to disruption of our
operations, loss of or inability to recruit key personnel, decline in colleague productivity, weakening of
internal standards, controls or procedures, and impairment of key customer and supplier relationships. In
addition, cost saving and operational efficiencies from improved production processes may not be able to
be sustained due to changes in customer needs, changes in regulations, availability and cost of materials
or other cost variables.

Our anticipated cost saving and operational run-rate synergies are based upon assumptions about
our ability to implement cost saving measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Our
ability to achieve planned cost saving and operational run-rate synergies is dependent upon a significant
number of assumptions, some of which may be beyond our control, including the development of the
markets for our products and services, political, legal, fiscal, market and economic conditions, regulatory
developments, and tariff and wage increases. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding
these measures proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than
planned and we may not be able to realise fully or at all, or realise in the anticipated timeframe, the
expected benefits from our cost saving and operational measures.

**_Any change resulting from our operations as a standalone company, whether real or perceived_**
**_may negatively impact our customer and supplier relationships._**

Following the consummation of the Transactions, some of our suppliers or other companies with
whom we conduct business may prefer to work with larger companies or different management teams.
They may also need assurances that our financial stability on a standalone basis is sufficient to satisfy
their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them. Any failure of parties to be satisfied
with our management or financial credibility could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

**_The Group's corporate structure has undergone, and will undergo, organisational changes in the_**
**_context of the Transactions, including the Separation and the Post-Completion Transactions,_**
**_making it challenging to transparently assess past and future performance and legal risks of the_**
**_ASDA Group._**

The Group's corporate structure has undergone, and will undergo, substantial organisational changes
in the context of the Transactions, including the Separation and the Post-Completion Transactions. As a
consequence, past events that are described in the Offering Memorandum as having occurred with respect
to the ASDA Group reflect events that occurred before the Company existed as a stand-alone business,
and may not be indicative of events that will occur following the Transactions, when the Company operates
a stand-alone business. It is therefore difficult to assess the applicability or magnitude of risks disclosed
in the Offering Memorandum given that such risks are based on the performance of the ASDA Group when
it was operating as part of Walmart rather than as part of a separate, stand-alone legal or reporting entity.
Similarly, it is difficult to predict our future performance following the Transactions, given that the historical
financial information for the Company as presented in this Offering Memorandum reflects periods that
have occurred prior to the Separation.

The measures and share transfers implemented to reorganise the ASDA Group may also have tax
effects on the Company and its subsidiaries. Given the substantial value of the Company and the
complexity of the measures taken, taxes relating to those measures could have an adverse effect on our
business, financial position and results of operations.

**_We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with_**
**_the Transactions._**

In connection with the Transactions, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur and bear
significant, costs and expenses, including taxes, financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other
advisory fees and expenses, reorganisation and restructuring costs, severance and employee benefitrelated expenses, printing expenses and other related charges. In addition, we may incur significant onetime charges as a result of costs associated with the Transactions. We will not be able to quantify the
exact amount of these charges or the period in which they will be incurred until after the Transactions are
completed. Some of the factors affecting the costs associated with the Transactions include the timing of
the completion of the Transactions, the resources required to transition the business to a standalone
company and the length of time during which transitional services are provided by Walmart. There are
also a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must
be developed in connection with the Transactions. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses
will be incurred in connection with the Transactions, there are many factors that could affect the total
amount or timing of the integration and implementation expenses. There may also be additional
unanticipated significant costs in connection with the Transactions that we do not anticipate and may not
be able to recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and income we expect to achieve
from the Transactions.

**Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness**

**_Our leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_condition, liquidity, results of operation or prospects._**

As of September 30, 2020, after giving effect to the Transactions, we would have had total third-party
debt of £4,721.0 million (equivalent). See "Capitalisation." From the Issue Date, we will be highly leveraged
and we anticipate that leverage will be sustained at this level or higher for the foreseeable future. The level
of indebtedness that we will hold from the Issue Date could, among other things:

     - limit our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital
expenditures, business opportunities and other corporate requirements;

     - reduce our flexibility to respond to, and pose additional risks for us in the face of, general
adverse economic and industry conditions;

     - reduce the portion of our cash flow from operations that will be available for uses other than
servicing our debt, such as funding working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint
ventures or other general corporate purposes;

     - restrict us from pursuing strategic acquisitions or exploiting certain business opportunities;

     - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the competitive
environment and the industry in which we operate;

     - place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;

### 117


-----

     - negatively impact credit terms with our creditors; and

     - limit our ability to borrow additional funds and increasing the cost of any such borrowing.

Any of these, or other, consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
satisfy our debt obligations, including our obligations under the Notes.

**_We may incur additional debt in the future, which may make it difficult for us to service our debt,_**
**_including the Notes, and impact our ability to operate our businesses._**

The agreements governing our debt limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, but do not prohibit
us from doing so. The terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility
(or, in the case of the Indentures, will) permit us to incur additional debt, including in respect of committed
borrowings of up to £690.0 million under the Revolving Credit Facilities. Some of this debt could rank pari
_passu with the Notes, be structurally senior to the Notes or be secured on assets which do not form part_
of the Collateral for the Senior Secured Notes or part of the Senior Notes Collateral for the Senior Notes.
Additional debt could also mature prior to the Notes. In addition, under the terms of the Indentures and the
Intercreditor Agreement, we are permitted, subject to certain conditions (including the refinancing of the
Term Loan Facilities in full), to incur new debt that has super senior priority status over the Notes in respect
of the proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral and certain distressed disposals. If new debt is
added to the Group's existing debt levels, the related risks that we currently face would increase.
Furthermore, if we are able to designate some of our Restricted Subsidiaries under the Indentures as
Unrestricted Subsidiaries, those Unrestricted Subsidiaries would be permitted to borrow beyond the
limitations specified in the Indentures and engage in other activities in which Restricted Subsidiaries may
not engage. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes" and "Description of the Senior Notes." In
addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement does not, and the Indentures will not, prevent us from incurring
obligations that do not constitute indebtedness as defined under each of these documents, including shortterm working capital facilities up to the greater of £360.0 million and 30% of our Consolidated EBITDA (as
defined in the respective documents), which are permitted to be secured by security interests in the
Collateral (including on a super senior basis, subject to the refinancing or repayment of the Term Loan
Facilities in full and certain other conditions). If we are ever unable to service our debt, it would likely have
a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects
and our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes and the Notes Guarantees.

**_Each of the Issuers is a holding company dependent upon cash flow from subsidiaries to meet its_**
**_obligations on the Notes and the Notes Guarantees._**

Each of the Issuers is a holding company with no independent business operations or significant assets
other than investments in our subsidiaries, and we depend upon the receipt of sufficient funds from our
subsidiaries to meet our obligations. We expect our operating subsidiaries to provide us with funds to meet
our obligations in respect of the Notes through a combination of dividends and payments in respect of
intercompany loans. Our subsidiaries' obligations under intercompany loans will be junior obligations and
will be subordinated in right of payment to all of the Group's existing and future senior and senior
subordinated indebtedness, including obligations under, or guarantees of obligations under, the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior
Notes.

If our subsidiaries do not distribute cash sufficient to make scheduled payments on the Notes, we will
not have any other source of funds that will allow us to make payments to the holders of the relevant
Notes. In addition, various agreements governing the Group's debt may restrict and, in some cases may
actually prohibit, the ability of these subsidiaries to move cash within their restricted group. Applicable tax
laws may also subject such payments to further taxation and applicable corporate law may limit the
amounts that some of our subsidiaries will be permitted to pay as dividends or distributions on their equity
interests, or even prohibit such payments. In particular, our subsidiaries' ability to pay dividends to us may
be limited to the amount of distributable reserves available to them. Finally, our subsidiaries that do not
guarantee the Notes have no obligation to make payments with respect to any of the Notes.

The inability to transfer cash among entities within their respective consolidated groups may mean that,
even though the entities, in aggregate, may have sufficient resources to meet their obligations, they may
not be permitted to make the necessary transfers from one entity in their consolidated group to another
entity in their consolidated group in order to make payments to the entity owing the obligations.

In addition, under various circumstances, the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically,
including:

    - upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the
capital stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding
company) or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
(other than to the applicable Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by
the applicable Indenture;

    - upon the designation of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with
the Indentures;

    - upon becoming a member of the Regulated Group;

    - upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Notes or upon
legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture,
as provided in the Indentures;

    - with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally
released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Facilities and (ii) does
not guarantee any Syndicated Term Facility or any other Credit Facility that provides for
aggregate lending commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of
determination or Public Debt;

    - pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
(including as described under "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—
_Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions Following an IPO");_

    - as allowed under the amendments and waivers provisions of the Indentures;

    - as allowed under the additional guarantees covenants of the Indentures;

    - as a result of a transaction permitted by "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Certain Covenants—Merger and_ _Consolidation—The Guarantors" or Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Merger and_ _Consolidation—The Guarantors;" or_

    - in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation.

In addition, the Notes Guarantees and Security Interests will be subject to release upon a distressed
disposal as contemplated under the Intercreditor Agreement. However, unless consented to, the
Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent shall not, in an enforcement scenario, exercise
its rights to release the claims of the Senior Notes holders against the Senior Notes Issuer and the Shared
Security or assets of any person that has provided a Guarantee in respect of the Senior Notes unless the
relevant sale or disposal is made:

    - with the prior consent of the Senior Notes Trustee (acting on the instructions of the
Senior Notes holders in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture or the holders of at
least a majority of the principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Notes); or

    - for consideration all or substantially all of which is in the form of cash;

    - concurrently with the unconditional discharge or release of the indebtedness of the
disposed entities to certain other creditors, including the creditors under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement and holders of
the Senior Secured Notes; and

    - such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made pursuant to
a (i) competitive sale process (being a public or private auction or other competitive sale
process which may or may not be conducted through court or other legal proceedings,
and which is conducted with the advice of a financial advisor (being an internationally
recognised accounting form or internationally recognised investment bank elected by the
Security Agent)), (ii) any process or proceedings approved or supervised by or on behalf
of any court of law which has jurisdiction and where there is a determination of value by
or on behalf of such court, or (iii) where a financial advisor has delivered an opinion in
respect of such sale or disposal that the amount received in connection therewith is fair
from a financial point of view taking into account all relevant circumstances including the
method of enforcement and the circumstances giving rise to such sale.

See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement," "Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes" and "Description of the Senior Notes."_

**_The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes will each be structurally subordinated to the_**
**_liabilities and preference shares (if any) of the Group's non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Generally, claims of creditors of a non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, and claims of
preference shareholders (if any) of the subsidiary, will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings
of the subsidiary over the claims of creditors of its parent entity, including claims by holders of the Notes
under the Notes Guarantees. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
reorganisation, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any of the Group's nonguarantor subsidiaries, holders of their indebtedness and their trade creditors will generally be entitled to
payment of their claims from the assets of those subsidiaries before any assets are made available for
distribution to the parent entities of such non-guarantor subsidiaries. As such, the Senior Secured Notes,
the Senior Notes and each Notes Guarantee will each be structurally subordinated to the creditors
(including trade creditors) and preference shareholders (if any) of the Group's non-guarantor subsidiaries.
In addition, neither the Senior Secured Notes Indenture nor the Senior Notes Indenture will require
subsidiaries that become a member of the Regulated Group to Guarantee the Notes under any
circumstances and any Notes Guarantee will be automatically released upon the relevant Guarantor
becoming a member of the Regulated Group.

As of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the ASDA Guarantors collectively accounted
for more than 99.9% of the ASDA Group's consolidated revenues and, as of October 20, 2020, the ASDA
Guarantors held title to sites representing 99.9% of the aggregate capital pricing of the ASDA Store and
Office Portfolio, as described in "Brokers' Opinions of Pricing." In addition, our audited consolidated
financial statements include both Guarantor and non-guarantor subsidiaries and, as such, may be of
limited use in assessing the financial position of the Guarantors.

**_Your rights in the Collateral may be adversely affected by the failure to perfect security interests_**
**_in the relevant assets._**

Under certain applicable law, a security interest in certain tangible and intangible assets can only be
properly perfected, and its priority retained, through certain actions undertaken by the secured party and/or
the grantor of the security. The security interests in the Collateral may not be perfected with respect to the
claims of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, if we, or the Security Agent, fail or
are unable to take the actions required to perfect any of these security interests. The Security Agent has
no obligation to perfect any of these liens or any security interest. In addition, certain applicable law
requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real
property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, can only be perfected at or promptly
following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified. Absent perfection, the Security
Agent, on behalf of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, may have
difficulty enforcing or may be entirely unable to enforce rights in the Senior Secured Notes Collateral (in
the case of the Senior Secured Notes) or the Senior Notes Collateral (in the case of the Senior Notes) in
competition with third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors, including those who
claim a security interest in the same assets. The Trustees and the Security Agent have no obligation to
monitor the acquisition of additional property or rights that constitute collateral or perfection of any security
interest and will not be expected to do so. There can be no assurance that we will inform the Trustees or
the Security Agent of, the future acquisition of property and rights that constitute collateral, and that
necessary action will be taken to properly perfect the security interest in such after-acquired collateral.

**_Certain of the Collateral will not be granted, and certain Guarantors will not guarantee the Notes,_**
**_until after the Issue Date or the Acquisition Completion Date._**

If this Offering is consummated prior to, and not substantially concurrently with or after, the Acquisition
Completion Date and the Escrowed Proceeds are deposited in the Escrow Accounts, the Notes will be
secured on the Issue Date by the Escrow Account Charges.

The Senior Secured Notes will be secured on the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion
Date by the Senior Secured Notes Initial Collateral and will not initially benefit from any security interest in
the Senior Secured Notes Post-Completion Collateral as described in "Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Security." Within 90 days of the Acquisition Completion Date, or 180 days of the Acquisition_
Completion Date in respect of each ASDA Guarantor's Material Real Property, subject to the Agreed
Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by the Senior Secured Notes PostCompletion Collateral described in "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security."

### 121


-----

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed only by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
on the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date by the Initial ASDA Guarantors as
described in "Description of the Senior Notes—General—The Notes Guarantees" and the Senior Secured
Notes will be guaranteed only by the Initial ASDA Guarantors as described in "Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—General—The Notes Guarantees." Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the_
Indentures, the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility will require the
Post-Completion Guarantors to provide Guarantees as described in "Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—General—The Notes Guarantees" and "Description of the Senior Notes—General—The Notes_
_Guarantees." There can be no assurance, however, that the Group will be successful in procuring such_
liens or guarantees within the time periods specified, if at all and the failure to do so could result in an
"event of default" under the relevant Indenture.

The Notes will not be secured by the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets, the Substitute Retail
Assets, the Designated Bank Accounts, the Post-Completion Disposal Receivables or the Forecourt
Disposal Receivable.

**_It may be difficult to realise the value of the Collateral securing the Notes._**

The Collateral will be subject, in each case, to any and all exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens
and other imperfections permitted under the Indentures and the Intercreditor Agreement and accepted by
other creditors that have the benefit of security interests in the Collateral from time to time, whether on or
after the date the Notes are first issued. The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances,
liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the
Security Agent to realise or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can
be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection
requirements, statutory liens or characterisation under the laws of certain jurisdictions.

Enforcement of the Security Interests by the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems
generally associated with the realisation of security interests in collateral. For example, under English law,
the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain
specific requirements. The share pledges will be enforced by the Security Agent. The Intercreditor
Agreement regulates the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured
Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Initially, the Security Agent will not be
required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing Group with a sufficient
majority. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security
interest. The Group cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents
when required to facilitate a sale of, or appropriate or otherwise foreclose on, the Collateral. For example,
any change in the direct or indirect control of ASL will require the approval of the FCA. Accordingly, the
Security Agent may not have the ability to sell or foreclose upon Collateral assets the sale of which would
result in any such change of control. In any such case, the value of the Collateral, may significantly
decrease.

**_Holders of the Notes will not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral, and the sale of_**
**_particular assets could reduce the pool of assets securing the Notes._**

The Security Documents will, subject to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt
Disposal Bridge Facility, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indentures, allow the Issuers, the Jersey
Security Provider, the Guarantors and other security providers to remain in possession of, retain control
over, freely operate, and collect, invest and dispose of any income from the Collateral. So long as no
acceleration event under the Indentures is occurring or would result therefrom, the Issuers and the
Guarantors, may, among other things, without any consent by the Security Agent, conduct ordinary course
activities with respect to the Collateral, such as selling, factoring or otherwise disposing of Collateral and
making ordinary course cash payments, including repayments of indebtedness. Any of these activities
could reduce the value of the Collateral and consequently the amounts payable to holders of the Notes
from the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral in the case of an enforcement.

**_The security interests over the Escrow Accounts and in the Collateral will be granted to the Trustee_**
**_and the Security Agent, respectively rather than directly to the holders of the Notes._**

The security interests over the Escrow Accounts and in the Collateral that will secure, amongst other
obligations, the Group's obligations under the Notes and the obligations of the Guarantors under the Notes
Guarantees will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favour of the
Trustee and the Security Agent, respectively. The terms of the Escrow Agreements and Escrow Account
Charges will allow only the relevant Trustee to enforce the security interests over the Escrow Accounts.
The Indentures will provide (along with the Intercreditor Agreement) that only the Security Agent has the
right to enforce the Security Interests in the Collateral. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not

### 122


-----

have direct security interests and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Escrow
Account Charges or the Collateral securing the Notes, except through the relevant Trustee, who will
(subject to the provisions of the Escrow Agreements, the Escrow Account Charges or the Indentures, as
applicable) either enforce the Escrow Account Charges in accordance with the provisions therein or,
following the Acquisition Completion Date, provide instructions to the Security Agent in respect of the
Collateral.

**_Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement_**
**_and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and_**
**_enforceability._**

Each Notes Guarantee will provide the relevant holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the
relevant Guarantor. In addition, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors
and certain other security providers, in the case of the Senior Secured Notes, and, in the case of the Senior
Notes, the Jersey Security Provider will secure the payment of the Notes by granting security under the
relevant Security Documents. However, each security interest granted under a Security Document will be
limited in scope to the value of the relevant assets expressed to be subject to that security interest, and
each Indenture will provide that each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that can be
guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor, without rendering the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest
(as applicable) voidable or otherwise ineffective under English or other applicable law, and enforcement
of each Notes Guarantee or Security Document (as applicable) would be subject to certain generally
available defences. These laws and defences include those that relate to corporate benefit, fraudulent
conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance
or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally. See "Certain Insolvency
_Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and Security_
_Interests."_

Although laws differ among various jurisdictions, in general, under fraudulent conveyance and other
laws, guarantees and security interests can be challenged (by the bankruptcy receiver or trustee, in case
of bankruptcy of the relevant Guarantor, or by any of the creditors of such Guarantor outside bankruptcy),
and a court could declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries thereof) and/or
void, any legal act performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of the Notes
Guarantees or the security interests granted under the Security Documents) and, if payment had already
been made under a Notes Guarantee or enforcement proceeds applied under a Security Document,
require that the recipient (and possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant
Guarantor, if the court found, inter alia, that:

      - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Notes Guarantee or the enforcement
proceeds under the relevant Security Document was in excess of the maximum
amount permitted under applicable law;

**●** the relevant Notes Guarantee or security interest under a Security Document was
incurred with actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud creditors or shareholders of the
Guarantor or, in certain jurisdictions, even when the recipient was simply aware that
the Guarantor was insolvent when it granted the relevant Notes Guarantee or security
interest;

**●** the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value for
granting the relevant Notes Guarantee/security interests and the Guarantor was: (i)
insolvent or rendered insolvent because of the relevant Notes Guarantee/security
interest; (ii) undercapitalised or became undercapitalised because of the relevant
Notes Guarantee/Security Document; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would
incur, indebtedness beyond its ability to pay at maturity; and/or

**●** the relevant Notes Guarantees/Security Documents were held to exceed the corporate
objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best interests or for the corporate benefit
of the Guarantor.

**_Currency exchange rates may have an impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity,_**
**_results of operations and prospects._**

We will be subject to foreign currency translation and transaction effects because the Group's business
is based in the United Kingdom and the Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in pounds
sterling; however, following the Issue Date, we will have a significant amount of euro-denominated debt
and may incur further euro-denominated debt in the future. Our results of operations may be affected by
both the transaction effects and the translation effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We

### 123


-----

will be required to pay principal and interest payments in a currency outside of our functional currency,
exposing us to unrealised and realised gains and losses due to foreign exchange depending on
fluctuations in exchange rates. In addition, fluctuations in the euro-sterling currency exchange rate could
have a substantial effect on our financial statements due to related gains or losses resulting from the
conversion into sterling of euro-denominated liabilities. Although we may use currency swaps to hedge
against the effect of changes in the euro-sterling rate, there can be no assurance that hedging will be
available on commercially reasonable terms and, even if such arrangements are available, they may not
completely insulate us from currency exchange risks. In addition, hedging itself carries certain risks,
including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any hedging
arrangements.

**_Our variable interest rate debt may be impacted by applicable regulation and may bear interest that_**
**_could rise significantly, thereby increasing our costs and reducing our cash flow._**

The debt the Group will incur under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge
Facility will bear interest at variable rates, and we will be exposed to the risk of fluctuations in interest
rates. In addition, the Indentures will permit us to incur substantial additional indebtedness, which may
bear a floating rate of interest. These interest rates could rise significantly in the future, increasing our
interest expense associated with these obligations, reducing cash flow available to fund working capital,
capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes and hindering our ability to make payments on
the Notes. Although we may enter into and maintain certain hedging arrangements designed to fix a
portion of these rates, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available on commercially
reasonable terms or that it will continue to be available on such terms in the future. Hedging itself carries
certain risks, including that we may need to pay a significant amount (including costs) to terminate any
hedging arrangements.

In addition, following allegations of manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR"), a
measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of
governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute
data in connection with the calculation of the daily Euro Interbank Offered Rate ("EURIBOR") or the
calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In
addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed
to be "benchmarks" are the subject of recent and ongoing national and international and other regulatory
reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013)
and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial
contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016.
Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may
change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be
eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on
July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel
banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the "FCA Announcement").
The FCA Announcement and a subsequent speech by the Director of Markets and Wholesale Policy at
the FCA on January 28, 2019 indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will
not be guaranteed, and market participants should not rely on its publication, after 2021. In July 2019, the
Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority commented that the market should prepare for
the end of LIBOR. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in
the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies
could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an
adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt or hedging
linked to such benchmark. If LIBOR or EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of
interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions
applicable to such debt. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may
result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse
impact on the Group's ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.

**_The insolvency laws of England and Wales and other jurisdictions may not be as favourable to you_**
**_as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due_**
**_on the Notes._**

The Issuers are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, the Guarantors are incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales and the Jersey Security Provider is, and certain other security
providers may be, incorporated under the laws of Jersey. In addition, the Security Documents will be
governed by the laws of England and Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and the rights under the
Security Documents will thus be subject to the laws of such jurisdictions. In the event of a bankruptcy,

### 124


-----

insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in England and Wales or other relevant
jurisdiction. Such multi-jurisdictional proceedings may be complex and more costly for creditors and
otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. Holders'
rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Indentures and the Security Documents, as applicable,
will be subject to the insolvency, property and administrative laws of several jurisdictions and there can be
no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, property, administrative and other laws of the Issuers', the
Guarantors' and the other security providers' jurisdictions of organisation or incorporation may be
materially different from, or in conflict with, each other and those of the United States, including in the
areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition
interest and duration of the proceeding. The application of these laws, or any conflict among them, could
call into question whether any particular jurisdiction's law should apply, adversely affect your ability to
enforce your rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Indentures and the Security Documents,
as applicable, in those jurisdictions or limit any amounts that you may receive. Further, certain orders,
proceedings or appointments entered, undertaken or effected with respect to the Issuers, the Guarantors
or the Jersey Security Provider (including pursuant to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act
2006) that may adversely affect Holders' rights under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Indentures
and the Security Documents may not result in any default or event of default occurring under the
Indentures. See "Certain Insolvency Considerations and _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the_
_Notes Guarantees and Security Interests" with respect to certain of the jurisdictions mentioned above._

**_The terms and conditions of the ASDA Leases are subject to change._**

The Warehouse and Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets,
are, and following the completion of the Post-Completion Disposals will continue to be, leased from Propco
2 (or one of our other non-controlled affiliates) by our Restricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the ASDA
Leases. We intend to use the proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions to repay amounts
outstanding under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. If market conditions require, we may
supplement the proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions with additional proceeds from the
transfer of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets (in each case
subject to the ASDA Leases) in sale transactions to fund the repayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility in full. See "The Transactions—The Post-Completion Transactions—Warehouse and Other
_Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility."_

In connection with these transactions, we may be required to amend the ASDA Leases, and the terms
of these leases and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility may permit such amendments in certain
circumstances. Furthermore, the Indentures and Senior Facilities Agreement will permit us to amend the
terms of the ASDA Lease subject only to compliance with the covenants described in "Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions" and "Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions." Accordingly, we will be allowed_
to amend the ASDA Leases provided that the terms of the amended ASDA Leases as amended are not
materially less favourable to the Issuers that those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction with
a Person who is not an Affiliate at the time of execution and we comply with certain corporate formalities
or the amendments are otherwise on terms substantially consistent with those described in this Offering
Memorandum.

If we amend the ASDA Leases, we cannot assure you that the as amended ASDA Leases will be as
favourable as the terms described in "The Transactions—The Post-Completion Transactions—
_Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility."_
Changes in market conditions between the Issue Date and the consummation of the sale of the Warehouse
and Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets, unanticipated
difficulties with the sale process or less favourable than anticipated outcomes from such sale process may
result in amendments to the ASDA Leases that could increase the Group's liabilities under these leases
or otherwise adversely affect its business.

**_The Group may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase_**
**_the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting_**
**_a change of control as required by each Indenture._**

Upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a "change of control," the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer would be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes
Issuer would be required to offer to repurchase all outstanding Senior Notes, in each case, at a purchase
price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date

### 125


-----

of purchase. A change of control may also result in an event of default under, acceleration of, or an
obligation to mandatorily prepay amounts outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and other indebtedness. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot
assure you that the Group would have sufficient funds available at such time, or that it would have sufficient
funds to provide to the relevant Issuer to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
or the Senior Notes or repay or prepay the Senior Facilities or the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility or
that the restrictions in the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Group's other
existing contractual obligations would allow us to make such required repurchases, repayments or
prepayments. The repurchase of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes pursuant to such an
offer could cause a default under such indebtedness, even if the change of control itself does not. The
ability of either the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to receive cash from its
subsidiaries to allow them to pay cash to the holders of the Senior Notes or the Senior Secured Notes,
respectively, following the occurrence of a change of control, may be limited by the Group's then existing
financial resources. In addition, we expect that we would require third-party financing to make an offer to
repurchase the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes, upon a change of control. We cannot assure
you that we would be able to obtain such financing. Any failure by the relevant Issuer to offer to purchase
the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, as applicable, would constitute a default under each of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture, respectively, which would, in turn,
constitute a default under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and
certain other indebtedness. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Change of Control" and
"Description of the Senior Notes—Change of Control." In addition, a change of control could constitute a
default under the Group's other indebtedness. If an event constituting a change of control occurs at a time
when the Group is prohibited from providing funds to the Senior Notes Issuer for the purpose of
repurchasing the Senior Notes (due to, for instance, an ongoing default or event of default under the Senior
Secured Notes or the Senior Facilities Agreement), the Group may seek the consent of the debt holders
under such indebtedness to such provision or may attempt to refinance the indebtedness that contain such
prohibition, but may be unable to obtain consent or to refinance such indebtedness and would remain
prohibited from repurchasing any Senior Notes. Additionally, an enforcement of the share pledge over the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Issuer could constitute a "change of control" under each
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes Indenture. Future indebtedness of the Issuers
or their subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a change of
control or require such indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a change of control.

**_In certain circumstances, a Change of Control Offer will not be required to be made._**

The change of control provisions contained in the Indentures may not necessarily afford you protection
in the event of certain important corporate events, including a reorganisation, restructuring, merger or
other similar transaction involving us that may adversely affect you, because such corporate events may
not involve a shift in voting power or beneficial ownership or, even if they do, may not constitute a "Change
of Control" as defined in the relevant Indenture. Except as described under "Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes—Change of Control" and "Description of the Senior Notes—Change of Control," each_
Indenture will not contain provisions that would require the relevant Issuer to offer to repurchase or
redeem the Notes in the event of a reorganisation, restructuring, merger, recapitalisation or similar
transaction.

The definition of "Change of Control" in each Indenture will include a disposition of all or substantially
all of the assets of the applicable Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any person.
Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no precise
established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there
may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of
"substantially all" of the assets of the applicable Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries taken as a whole.
As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a change of control has occurred and whether the Issuers
are required to make an offer to repurchase the relevant Notes.

**_There may not be an active trading market for the Notes, in which case your ability to sell the Notes_**
**_may be limited._**

The Group cannot assure you as to:

     - the liquidity of any market in the Notes;

    - your ability to sell your Notes; or

    - the prices at which you would be able to sell your Notes.

### 126


-----

Future trading prices for the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things,
prevailing interest rates, the Group's operating results and the market for similar securities. Historically,
the market for non-investment grade securities has been subject to disruptions that have caused
substantial volatility in the prices of securities similar to the Notes. The liquidity of a trading market for the
Notes may be adversely affected by a general decline in the market for similar securities and is subject
to disruptions that may cause volatility in prices. The trading market for the Notes may attract different
investors and this may affect the extent to which the Notes may trade. It is possible that the market for
the Notes will be subject to disruptions. Any such disruption may have a negative effect on you, as a
holder of the Notes, regardless of the Group's prospects and financial performance. As a result, there is
no assurance that there will be an active trading market for either the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior
Notes. If no active trading market develops, you may not be able to resell your holding of the Notes at a
fair value, if at all.

Although an application will be made for each of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes to
be listed on the Official List of the Exchange, the Group cannot assure you that either the Senior Secured
Notes or the Senior Notes will become or remain listed. Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity
of either the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes as a result of the admission to trading on the
Official List of the Exchange, failure to be approved for listing or the delisting (whether or not for an
alternative admission to listing on another stock exchange) of the relevant Notes, as applicable, from the
Exchange may have a material effect on a holder's ability to resell the relevant Notes, as applicable, in
the secondary market.

In addition, each Indenture will allow us to issue additional notes in the future which could exacerbate
the impact of a lack of sufficient liquidity of the relevant Notes.

**_Investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes will be denominated and payable in sterling. If investors in Notes measure their investment
returns by reference to a currency other than sterling, such investment in the Notes will entail foreign
exchange-related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the values of the
sterling relative to the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments
because of economic, political and other factors over which the Group has no control. Depreciation of the
sterling against the currency by reference to which investors measure the return on their investments
could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and could result
in a loss to investors when the return on such Notes is translated into the currency by reference to which
the investors measure the return on their investments. Investments in the Notes denominated in a
currency other than U.S. dollars by U.S. investors may also have important tax consequences as a result
of foreign exchange gains or losses, if any. See "Certain Tax Considerations—Certain United States
_Federal Income Tax Considerations."_

**_The Notes may be issued with original issue discount for U.S. federal income tax purposes._**

The Notes may be issued with original issue discount ("OID") for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A
series of Notes will be considered to be issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such series
exceeds their issue price (as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes) by an amount equal to or
more than a statutorily defined de minimis amount. In such event, investors in such series of Notes subject
to U.S. federal income taxation generally will be required to include such OID in their gross income (as
ordinary income) on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular
method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, such investors generally will
include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. See "Certain
_Tax Considerations—Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations—Original Issue_
_Discount."_

**_You may not be able to recover in civil proceedings for U.S. securities law violations._**

Each of the Issuers, the Jersey Security Provider and the Guarantors and their respective
subsidiaries are organised outside the United States, and the Group's business is conducted entirely
outside the United States. The directors, managers and/or executive officers of the Issuers, the Jersey
Security Provider and the Guarantors are non-residents of the United States. Although the Issuers, the
Jersey Security Provider, the Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries will submit to the jurisdiction
of certain New York courts in connection with any action under U.S. securities laws, you may be unable
to effect service of process within the United States on these directors, managers and executive officers.
In addition, as all of the assets of the Issuers, the Jersey Security Provider and the Guarantors and their
respective subsidiaries and those of their directors, managers and executive officers are located outside
of the United States, you may be unable to enforce judgments obtained in the U.S. courts against them.
Moreover, actions of the Issuers, the Jersey Security Provider and the Guarantors may not be subject to

### 127


-----

the provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound
by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards,
rendered in civil and commercial matters with England and Wales or Jersey. There is, therefore, doubt
as to the enforceability in England and Wales and Jersey of U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce
a U.S. judgment in such jurisdictions. In addition, the enforcement in England and Wales and Jersey of
any judgment obtained in a U.S. court, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws,
will be subject to certain conditions. There is also doubt that a court in England and Wales and Jersey
would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies sought in an original action brought in such
jurisdictions on the basis of U.S. securities laws violations. For further information see "Service of Process
_and Enforcement of Judgments."_

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may_**
**_be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings
may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to the structure, market, additional risk factors
discussed in this Offering Memorandum and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit
rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension
or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain
constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the
credit rating agency if, in its judgment, circumstances in the future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or
withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the relevant Notes by one or more of the credit rating
agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of the Group's financings and could
adversely affect the value and trading of such Notes.

**_Certain covenants will be suspended upon the occurrence of a change in the Group's ratings._**

The Indentures will provide that, if at any time following the date of the Indentures, the Notes receive
both a rating of Baa3 or better by Moody's and a rating of BBB- or better from Standard & Poor's (or, in
each case, the equivalent rating by Fitch if either Moody's or Standard & Poor's has no rating for the
Notes) and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing, then beginning that day the
provisions of the Indentures described in "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain
_Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status" and "Description of_
_the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade_
_Status" will not apply to the Notes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the rating assigned by any such_
rating agency to such Notes should subsequently decline to below such ratings, the foregoing covenants
will be reinstituted as of and from the date of such rating decline. If these covenants were to be
suspended, the Group would be able to incur additional debt or make payments, including dividends or
investments, which may conflict with the interests of holders of the Notes. In addition, during the period
in which the covenants are suspended, there will be no restrictions on our ability to designate any of our
subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve an
investment grade rating or that any such rating will be maintained.

**_The transfer of the Notes is restricted, which may adversely affect their liquidity and the price at_**
**_which they may be sold._**

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been registered under, and the Group is not obliged
to register the Notes or the Notes Guarantees under, the Securities Act or the securities laws of any other
jurisdiction and, unless so registered, may not be offered or sold except pursuant to an exemption from,
or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the Securities Act and any other applicable
laws. See "Notice to Investors." The Group has not agreed to or otherwise undertaken to register any of
the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes or the Notes Guarantees, and do not have any intention to
do so.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form, and therefore you must rely on the procedures_**
**_of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered notes are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests (which may occur only in very limited circumstances), owners of bookentry interests will not be considered owners or holders of Notes. The common depositary (or its
nominee) for Euroclear and Clearstream will be the sole registered holder of the global notes. Payments
of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the relevant global notes representing
the Notes will be made to the Paying Agent, which will make payments to Euroclear and Clearstream.
Thereafter, these payments will be credited to participants' accounts that hold book-entry interests in the
global notes representing the Notes and credited by such participants to indirect participants. After
payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, we will have no responsibility or

### 128


-----

liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.
Accordingly, owners of book-entry interests in the relevant Notes must rely on the procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and if such owners are not a participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream,
on the procedures of the participant through which their interest is owned, to exercise any rights and
obligations of a holder of the relevant Notes under the relevant Indenture.

Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests will not have any direct
rights to act upon any solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions from holders of
the Notes. Instead, owners of book-entry interests will be permitted to act only to the extent they have
received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear and Clearstream or, if applicable, from a
participant. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such proxies
will be sufficient to enable an owner of a book entry interest to vote on any matters or on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default under the relevant Indenture, unless and until
the relevant definitive registered Notes are issued in respect of all book-entry interests, owners of bookentry interests will be restricted to acting through Euroclear and Clearstream. We can make no
assurances that the procedures to be implemented through Euroclear and Clearstream will be adequate
to ensure the timely exercise of rights under the Notes.

**_The interests of the Group's principal shareholders may conflict with your interests._**

The interests of the Group's principal shareholders, in certain circumstances, may conflict with your
interests as holders of the Notes. Following the Transactions, all of the outstanding shares of the Senior
Notes Issuer will be indirectly held by Bellis TopCo Limited, which is 50% owned by the Issa family and
50% owned by funds managed by TDR Capital LLP. See "Principal Shareholders." As a result, the
principal shareholders have, and will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power to, among other
things, affect the Group's legal and capital structure and its day-to-day operations, as well as the ability
to elect and change its management and to approve any other changes to its operations. Our principal
shareholders may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other
transactions that, in their judgment, will enhance their equity investments, although such transactions
might involve risks to you as a holder of Notes. For example, these shareholders could vote to cause us
to incur additional indebtedness, sell certain material assets or pay dividends, in each case, so long as
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement so permit. The incurrence of
additional indebtedness could increase the Group's debt service obligations, the payment of dividends
would reduce the Group's ability to meet its debt service obligations or fund working capital, capital
expenditures or general corporate purposes and the sale of certain assets would reduce the Group's
ability to generate revenue, each of which could adversely affect holders of the Notes.

In addition, our principal shareholders own the EG Group, which operates in the fuel and convenience
retail industry in jurisdictions including the United Kingdom, and may, in the future, own businesses that
directly compete with ours or do business with us.

**_We will be subject to significant restrictive debt covenants, which limit our operating and financial_**
**_flexibility._**

The Indentures will contain covenants which impose significant operating and financial restrictions on
us. These agreements limit our ability to, among other things:

    - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred stock;

    - make certain restricted payments and investments;

    - transfer or sell assets;

    - enter into transactions with affiliates;

    - create or incur certain liens;

    - make certain loans, investments or acquisitions of minority interests;

    - create or incur restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or to make other
payments to us;

    - take certain actions that would impair the Security Interests granted for the benefit of the holders
of the Notes; and

    - merge, consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of our assets.

### 129


-----

These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability
to pursue acquisitions and other business activities that may be in our interest.

In addition, we are subject to the affirmative and negative covenants contained in the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities Agreement, the Senior Bridge Facility Agreement and
the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement, which, in the case of the negative covenants, are
substantially in line with those applicable to the Notes (other than certain additional covenants applicable
to the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities Agreement, the Senior Bridge
Facility Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement customary for facilities of that
nature). A breach of any of those covenants could result in an event of default under those debt documents,
which could lead to an event of default and acceleration under our other debt instruments that contain
cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indentures. If our creditors accelerate the
payment of amounts owing to them under such other debt instruments, we cannot assure you that our
assets and the assets of our subsidiaries would be sufficient to repay in full those amounts, to satisfy all
our other liabilities and the liabilities of our subsidiaries which would be due and payable and to make
payments to enable us to repay the Notes, in full or in part. In addition, if we are unable to repay those
amounts, our creditors could proceed against any security interests granted to them to secure repayment
of those amounts.

**_We will require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our_**
**_ability to generate or raise sufficient cash depends on many factors beyond our control._**

On the Issue Date, we expect to issue a significant amount of debt and will have significant debt service
obligations, including under the Notes, the Senior Facilities and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility.
Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on and to refinance our debt, and to fund
working capital, rental and lease payments and capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating
performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends, to some extent, on the success of our
business strategy and on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and
other factors discussed in these "Risk Factors" and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, as well as
other factors, many of which are beyond our control. This also depends on our cash flow cycle, which
experiences seasonal fluctuations. Levels of customer traffic at our stores are affected by the weather and
travel patterns, among other factors, which could also have a negative impact on our cash position and
impact our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund working capital and capital
expenditures. If our interest payment dates coincide with periods of significant cash outflow, we may have
insufficient cash to pay our obligations as they come due.

We cannot assure you that the currently anticipated cost savings, revenue growth and operating
improvements will be realised, that cash flows from operations will be sufficient, or that future debt and
equity financing will be available to us on satisfactory terms or in an amount sufficient to enable us to
refinance all or a portion of our debt, pay our debts when due, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay our
obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

    - reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

    - sell assets;

    - obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

    - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis
or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in
part on our financial condition at such time as well as on many factors outside of our control, including
then-prevailing conditions in the international credit and capital markets. In such event, we may not to be
able to meet our debt repayment obligations. In addition, the terms of our debt limit, and any future debt
may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives. See "—We will be subject to significant restrictive
_debt covenants, which limit our operating and financial flexibility."_ Any refinancing of our debt could be at
higher interest rates and could require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further
restrict our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects. There can be no
assurance that any assets which we could be required to dispose of could be sold or that, if sold, the timing
of such sale and the amount of proceeds realised from such sale would be acceptable.

Furthermore, our inability to meet payment obligations under our existing debt could trigger various
default provisions, accelerate a substantial portion (if not all) of our debt, and would materially adversely
affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and prospects.

**Risks Relating to the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral**

**_Risks Relating to the Senior Secured Notes_**

**_Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not control decisions regarding the Senior Secured Notes_**
**_Collateral in certain circumstances._**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured on a first-priority
basis by the same Collateral securing the obligations under the Senior Facilities and the Forecourt
Disposal Bridge Facility. In addition, under the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement, the Group is (or, in the case of the
Indentures, will be) permitted to incur significant additional indebtedness and other obligations that may
be secured by the same Collateral on a _pari passu_ basis, including other credit facilities and certain
hedging liabilities.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that a common Security Agent, who is also the security agent for
the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement and
any additional debt secured by the Collateral permitted to be incurred by the Indentures, the Senior
Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, will act only as provided for in the
Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Senior Secured Notes
Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement
action. Initially, the Security Agent will not be required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do
so by an Instructing Group (as defined under _"Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—_
_Intercreditor Agreement") that comprises creditors holding more than 50% of the indebtedness under the_
Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement
and indebtedness ranking pari passu with such indebtedness (the "Majority Senior Secured Creditors")
(in each case acting through their respective creditor representative). As of the Issue Date, we expect the
aggregate amount of senior indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement to exceed the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
the Senior Secured Notes, and following the repayment of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, we
expect the amount outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement to continue to exceed the aggregate
principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding. Additionally, the Senior Facilities Agreement and
the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement (or, in the case of the Indentures, will) allow the Group
to incur additional indebtedness secured on a _pari passu_ basis with the Senior Secured Notes, which
would further dilute the voting interest of holders of the Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date.

The lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, lenders under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge
Facility Agreement and creditors in respect of any indebtedness secured on a pari passu basis with the
Senior Secured Notes that we may incur in the future may have interests that are different from the
interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes and they may, subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, elect to pursue their remedies under the Security Documents at a time when it would be
disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to do so.

In addition, if the Security Agent sells Collateral comprising the shares of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any of its holding companies or subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action or other
distressed disposal in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees against, and the liens over any other assets of, such
entities and any subsidiaries of such entity securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured
Notes Guarantees may be released. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements— Intercreditor
_Agreement" and "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security—Release_ _of Liens."_

**_The Senior Secured Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to secure the obligations under the_**
**_Senior Secured Notes._**

On the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured by security interests in the Senior Secured Notes Initial
Collateral and, within 90 days of the Acquisition Completion Date (or 180 days of the Acquisition
Completion Date in respect of each ASDA Guarantor's Material Real Property), the Senior Secured Notes
and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees will be secured by security interests in the Senior Secured
Notes Post-Completion Collateral, in each case as described in this Offering Memorandum. The Collateral
securing the Senior Secured Notes will also secure the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement and, with respect to the Shared Security, the Senior
Notes (on a second-priority basis). Such Collateral may also secure additional debt ranking pari passu
with the Senior Secured Notes to the extent permitted to be incurred by the terms of the Indentures, the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement and the Intercreditor
Agreement. The holders of Senior Secured Notes' rights to the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may

### 131


-----

therefore be diluted by any increase in the debt secured by such Collateral on a pari passu or senior basis
or a reduction in the value of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes.

The value that holders of the Senior Secured Notes may receive upon enforcement of the Senior
Secured Notes Collateral will depend upon many factors, including, among others, the ability to sell this
Collateral in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which our operations are located and the
availability of buyers. The book value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral should not be relied on as a
measure of realisable value for such assets. All or a portion of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may
be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value. Likewise, we cannot assure you that there
will be a market for the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral, or, if such a market exists, that there
will not be a substantial delay in its liquidation. In addition, the share pledges over the shares of an entity
may be of no value if that entity is subject to an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding. The Senior Secured
Notes Collateral is located in England, Northern Ireland and Scotland, and the multijurisdictional nature of
any foreclosure on the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may limit its realisable value. For example, the
bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the various jurisdictions may be materially
different from, or conflict with, each other, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of government
and other creditors, ability to obtain post-petition interest and duration of the proceedings. In addition, third
parties may have rights over Material Real Property (including rights to acquire and pre-emption rights)
exercisable in the event of transfer of such Material Real Property (including as a result of enforcement of
security interests in such Senior Secured Notes Collateral). In such cases, the enforcement of the security
interests over, or transfer of, such Material Real Property may be significantly delayed, prevented in part
or prevented entirely.

If the Offering is consummated prior to, and not substantially concurrently with, the Acquisition
Completion Date and the Escrowed Proceeds are deposited in the Escrow Accounts, the Notes will be
secured on the Issue Date by the respective Escrow Account Charges. Under the terms of the Escrow
Agreements, amounts may be released from the Escrow Accounts prior to the Acquisition Completion
Date to pay accrued interest on the Notes on any interest payment date in respect thereof occurring prior
to the Escrow Release Date. Accordingly, the value of the Issue Date Collateral may be less than the
outstanding principal amount of Notes issued on the Issue Date.

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes,_**
**_the transfer of the Forecourt Assets or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create_**
**_or restart hardening periods, i.e., the periods of time following the granting of security interests_**
**_during which such security interests may be challenged in accordance with the laws applicable in_**
**_certain jurisdictions._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes
Guarantees following the Issue Date may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain
jurisdictions. The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be
secured on the Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, as the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will permit the release and retaking of security granted in favour of the Senior
Secured Notes in certain circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness
and a Permitted Reorganisation. Please see "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security."

A number of the forecourts owned by ASDA and its subsidiaries are adjacent to, and captured under
the same title as, its retail assets. In order to execute the Forecourt Business Disposal and any required
Excluded Forecourt Divestments, we will separate the title to such forecourts from the title to the adjacent
retail assets.

The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new
security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated
were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it
may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Please see "Certain
_Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
_Security Interests."_

**_If the Revolving Credit Facilities are designated as super senior liabilities in accordance with the_**
**_terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Indentures, creditors under the Revolving Credit_**
**_Facilities and counterparties to certain hedging obligations and future indebtedness permitted to_**
**_be incurred on a super senior basis under the terms of the Indentures and the Intercreditor_**
**_Agreement are entitled to be repaid with proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral in priority_**
**_to the Senior Secured Notes._**

The Intercreditor Agreement includes provisions governing the sharing of proceeds from enforcement
of the Collateral. Such enforcement proceeds are required to be turned over to the Security Agent after

### 132


-----

certain events, including the acceleration of the Notes. The Security Agent is required to apply turned-over
amounts and other recoveries by the Security Agent from enforcement actions toward discharging the
super senior obligations (including, among others, (following the designation of the Revolving Credit
Facilities as super senior liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Indentures) those under the Revolving Credit Facilities, certain hedging obligations and future
indebtedness that may, pursuant to the terms of the Indentures, be secured on a super senior basis under
certain circumstances, including the refinancing in full of the Term Loan Facilities (the "Super Senior
**Liabilities")) in priority to applying any such amounts toward discharging the Senior Secured Notes. As**
such, in the event of a foreclosure of the Collateral, holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not benefit
from such recoveries if the then-outstanding claims under such Super Senior Liabilities are greater than
the proceeds recovered. Any proceeds remaining from an enforcement sale of Collateral will, after all
obligations under such Super Senior Liabilities have been discharged, be applied pro rata in repayment of
the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Facilities (other than the Revolving Credit Facilities where a
designation of the Revolving Credit Facilities as super senior liabilities in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement has occurred), the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and any other obligations
secured by the Collateral which are permitted to rank _pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes._
Furthermore, claims of other secured creditors that are secured by assets that do not also secure the
Senior Secured Notes will have priority with respect to such assets over the claims of holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. As such, the claims of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will be effectively
subordinated to the rights of such secured creditors to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness.

**_Risks Relating to the Senior Notes_**

**_The rights to enforce remedies with respect to the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior_**
**_Notes and with respect to the Senior Notes Guarantees are limited as long as any super senior or_**
**_senior secured debt is outstanding._**

The security interests in the Shared Security securing the Senior Notes will rank behind the first-priority
security interests in the Shared Security in favour of creditors in respect of the Senior Secured Notes,
lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and creditors in
respect of any future indebtedness which is permitted under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt
Disposal Bridge Facility and the Indentures to be incurred and secured by the Shared Security and which
is permitted to rank pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the "Senior Secured Debt")
and any indebtedness in favour of institutions with whom the Group enters into certain hedging
arrangements (the liabilities owing to such creditors, together with the Senior Secured Debt, being "Senior
**Secured Liabilities"). The Intercreditor Agreement provides that the Security Agent serves as a common**
security agent for the secured parties under the agreements under which Senior Secured Liabilities are or
may be incurred and will (subject to certain limited exceptions) act with respect to such Collateral only at
the direction of the relevant Instructing Group until amounts outstanding in respect of the Senior Secured
Liabilities are paid in full and discharged. The creditors and counterparties under Senior Secured
Liabilities, respectively, will have (unless the relevant Instructing Group otherwise consents) the exclusive
right to make all decisions with respect to the enforcement of remedies relating to such Collateral. See
"Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement." As a result, the holders of the_
Senior Notes will not be able to independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Security
Documents or force a sale of the asset comprising the Shared Security without the consent of or unless
instructed to do so by the relevant Instructing Group, until the earlier of the expiration of the applicable
standstill period and the repayment and discharge in full of the Senior Secured Liabilities.

In addition, in the circumstances in which the holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled to issue
enforcement instructions to the Security Agent with respect to the Shared Security, creditors in respect of
indebtedness whose security interest in the Collateral ranks senior to the Senior Notes may have the right
to issue enforcement instructions in relation to any Collateral that does not also secure the Senior Notes
or in respect of the Collateral that is not (directly or indirectly) affected by the enforcement instructions. If
the Security Agent has notified the Senior Notes Trustee that it is enforcing Collateral, no other Senior
Notes creditor may take any otherwise permitted enforcement action against the relevant members of the
Group while the Security Agent is taking steps to enforce the Collateral in accordance with the instructions
of the instructing group where such action might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such enforcement
or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom.

The creditors and counterparties in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities may have interests that
are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Notes, and they may elect to pursue their remedies
under the Security Documents at a time when it would be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior

Security the proceeds from such Collateral, after having satisfied obligations under the Senior Secured
Liabilities, are less than the aggregate amount outstanding under the Senior Notes.

In addition, if the creditors in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities direct the sale of the shares of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the shares of another Group company through an enforcement of their
first-priority Security Interests or at a time when the Security Interests have become enforceable in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes Guarantees and the liens over
any other assets securing the Senior Notes and each Senior Notes Guarantee may (subject to certain
conditions) be released. See "Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement"_
and "Description of the Senior Notes— Security—Release of Liens."

We may also issue further indebtedness which will be entitled to rank pari passu with or senior to the
Senior Notes in right and priority of payment and which will be entitled to share in the Senior Notes
Collateral with the Senior Notes on a pari passu or senior-priority basis. In the event that any such debt is
issued, your creditor voting rights will be diluted proportionately to the amount of debt incurred.

**_The Senior Notes Guarantees will be subordinated to the Group's existing and future super senior_**
**_debt and senior secured debt._**

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes Guarantees will be senior subordinated
obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the other Guarantors and:

  - will rank pari passu in right of payment to all existing and future senior subordinated debt;

  - will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future senior indebtedness of each
such Guarantor, including such Guarantor's obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge
Facility and certain hedging obligations;

  - will be effectively subordinated to any existing and future indebtedness of that Guarantor that is
secured by property and assets that do not secure such Senior Notes Guarantee or that is secured
on a first-priority basis over property and assets that secure such Senior Notes Guarantee on a
second-priority basis (including that Guarantor's obligations under the Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and certain hedging
obligations), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such other
indebtedness.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that no enforcement action with respect to the Senior
Notes Guarantees (or any future guarantee of the Senior Notes, if any) may be taken until the earlier of
(subject to certain limited exceptions): (i) any enforcement action being taken with respect to debt of a
member of the Group ranking senior to the Senior Notes (provided the Senior Notes Trustee and holders
of the Senior Notes will be limited to taking the same enforcement action against the same member of the
Group in relation to the Senior Notes Guarantees); (ii) the occurrence of an insolvency event with respect
to any Senior Notes Guarantor; (iii) a default on the Senior Notes remaining outstanding after a period of
up to 179 days from the date the agent or Senior Secured Notes Trustee with respect to Senior Secured
Debt received written notice of such default; (iv) failure to pay liabilities under the Senior Notes at maturity;
or (v) the Instructing Group (as defined in "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement") has given its consent to the proposed action._

Upon any distribution to the creditors of a Senior Notes Guarantor in a liquidation, administration,
bankruptcy, moratorium of payments, dissolution or other winding-up of such Senior Notes Guarantor, the
holders of indebtedness of such Senior Notes Guarantor ranking senior to the Senior Notes will be entitled
to be paid in full before any payment may be made with respect to such Guarantor's Senior Notes
Guarantee. As a result, holders of the Senior Notes may receive less, ratably, than the holders of debt of
the Senior Notes Guarantors ranking senior to the Senior Notes Guarantees, including the lenders under
the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and holders of the Senior
Secured Notes and other indebtedness that is allowed to rank pari passu with them.

**_The Intercreditor Agreement provides that in certain circumstances payments in respect of the_**
**_Senior Notes may be blocked._**

Prior to the discharge of all Senior Secured Liabilities, no member of the Group may make payments
in respect of the Senior Notes without the consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors except as
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement. The payments which are permitted under the Intercreditor
Agreement without the consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors are summarised under the caption
"Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Payments and Prepayments;
_Subordination of the Senior Notes" (each such payment a "Permitted Payment")._

If the Group defaults on its payments under or in respect of:

   - the Senior Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility or other Senior Secured Debt
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of an amount constituting principal,
interest or fees, or otherwise exceeding €1,000,000 (equivalent);

   - the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (in respect of an amount constituting principal, interest
or fees, or otherwise exceeding €2,500,000 (equivalent); and/or

   - the cash management facility documents in respect of an amount constituting principal,
interest or fees, or otherwise exceeding €1,000,000 (equivalent),

(each a "Senior Secured Debt Payment Default") the Group's ability to make Permitted Payments will
be automatically suspended.

In addition, if an event of default (other than a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default) has occurred
under the finance documents in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities, creditors in respect of the Senior
Secured Liabilities may deliver a notice to us, the Security Agent and the Senior Notes Trustee suspending
the Group's ability to make Permitted Payments for a period of up to 179 days (such notice a "Topco
**Payment Stop Notice").**

If a Senior Secured Debt Payment Default occurs and for so long as a Topco Payment Stop Notice is
outstanding the Group's ability to make payments in respect of the Senior Notes will be limited to payments
by the Senior Notes Issuer and any other payments to which the Majority Senior Secured Creditors give
their prior consent. In such circumstances the Group cannot assure you that the Group will be able to
obtain such consent or, in the absence of such consent be able to meet its payment obligations in respect
of the Senior Notes. For more detail please see the caption _"Description of Certain Financing_
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Payments and Prepayments; Subordination of the Senior_
_Notes."_

**_The granting of the security interests in connection with the issuance of the Senior Notes, the_**
**_transfer of the Forecourt Assets or the incurrence of permitted debt in the future, may create or_**
**_restart hardening periods, i.e., the periods of time following the granting of security interests_**
**_during which such security interests in accordance with the laws applicable in certain_**
**_jurisdictions._**

The granting of security interests to secure the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees
following the Issue Date may create hardening periods for such security interests in certain jurisdictions.
The granting of shared security interests to secure future indebtedness permitted to be secured on the
Senior Notes Collateral may restart or reopen such hardening periods in particular, as the Senior Notes
Indenture permits the release and retaking of security granted in favour of the Senior Notes in certain
circumstances, including in connection with the incurrence of future indebtedness and a Permitted
Reorganisation. Please see "Description of the Senior Notes—Security."

A number of the forecourts owned by ASDA and its subsidiaries are adjacent to, and captured under
the same title as, its retail assets. In order to execute the Forecourt Disposal and any required Excluded
Forecourt Divestments, we will separate the title to such forecourts from the title to the adjacent retail
assets.

The applicable hardening period for these new security interests can run from the moment each new
security interest has been granted or perfected. At each time, if the security interest granted or recreated
were to be enforced before the end of the respective hardening period applicable in such jurisdiction, it
may be declared void or ineffective and/or it may not be possible to enforce it. Please see "Certain
_Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
_Security Interests."_

**_Claims of the Group's senior secured creditors and, if the Revolving Credit Facilities are_**
**_designated as super senior liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,_**
**_claims in respect of any such Super Senior Liabilities will have priority with respect to their security_**
**_over the claims of Senior Notes holders, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such_**
**_indebtedness._**

Claims of the Group's senior secured creditors and, in the event the Revolving Credit Facilities are
designated as super senior liabilities in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, claims
in respect of any such Super Senior Liabilities will have priority with respect to the assets securing their
indebtedness over the claims of holders of the Senior Notes. As such, each Senior Notes Guarantee will
be effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness ranking senior to the Senior Notes (including

### 135


-----

obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Liabilities) to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such indebtedness or other obligations if such assets secure the Senior Notes on a junior-priority basis or
do not secure the Senior Notes. In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation,
reorganisation, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of any Guarantor that has
secured obligations, holders of senior secured indebtedness and creditors in respect of Super Senior
Liabilities, if any, will have prior claims to the assets of the relevant Guarantor that constitute their collateral.
Subject to the limitations referred to under the caption "—Risks Relating to _the Group's Structure—Each_
_Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be_
_limited by applicable law or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability," the_
holders of the Senior Notes will participate ratably with all holders of the unsecured indebtedness of the
relevant Guarantor (other than indebtedness to which the Senior Notes Guarantees have been expressly
subordinated) to the extent the Senior Notes are not repaid in full from the proceeds of an enforcement of
the Senior Notes Collateral, and, potentially with all of their other general creditors, based upon the
respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in the remaining assets of the relevant Guarantor. In
the event that any of the senior secured indebtedness or Super Senior Liabilities (if any) of the relevant
Guarantor becomes due or the creditors in respect thereof commence enforcement proceedings against
Collateral that secures such indebtedness, the Senior Notes Collateral remaining after repayment of that
secured indebtedness may not be sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of the relevant Senior
Notes Guarantee. As a result, holders of Senior Notes may receive less, ratably, than holders of senior
secured indebtedness and creditors in respect of Super Senior Liabilities (if any) of the relevant Guarantor.

As of September 30, 2020, on a pro forma basis to reflect the Acquisition and the Financing, we would
have had an aggregate principal amount of £3,935.0 million (equivalent) of secured indebtedness
outstanding secured by liens on assets that do not secure the Senior Notes and liens which rank in priority
to the liens securing the Senior Notes. The Group may also issue further indebtedness which will be
entitled to rank pari passu with or senior to the Senior Notes in right and priority of payment and which will
be entitled to share in the Collateral with the Senior Notes on a pari passu or senior basis, including £690.0
million available for borrowing under the Revolving Credit Facilities. In the event that any such debt is
further issued, your creditor voting rights will be diluted proportionately to the amount of indebtedness
incurred.

**_The ability of holders of Senior Notes to recover under the pledge of the shares of the Senior_**
**_Secured Notes Issuer and other Shared Security may be limited._**

The obligations under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees will be secured by security
interests over the Shared Security on a second-priority basis. First-priority security interests over the
Shared Security will be granted for the benefit of creditors in respect of Senior Secured Liabilities. Holders
of the Senior Notes may not be able to recover on the Shared Security as the creditors in respect of the
Senior Secured Liabilities will have a prior claim on all proceeds realised from any enforcement of such
Shared Security and any distressed disposal with respect to such Shared Security, and the Senior Notes
will need to share any remaining proceeds from such enforcement with any other secured creditor ranking
_pari passu with the Senior Notes, pro rata. If the proceeds realised from the enforcement of such Shared_
Security exceed the Senior Secured Liabilities, any excess amount of such proceeds will be paid to the
Senior Notes Trustee on behalf of itself and the holders of the Senior Notes. If there are no excess
proceeds, or if the amount of such excess proceeds is less than the aggregate amount of the obligations
under the Senior Notes, the holders of Senior Notes will not fully recover (if at all) under such Shared
Security.

In addition, the Shared Security may not be liquid, and its value to other parties may be less than its
value to us. Likewise, the Group cannot assure you that there will be a market for the pledged shares or
other Shared Security or that, if such market does exist, there will not be substantial delays in their
liquidation. The shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may also have limited value in the event of a
bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceeding in relation to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer because
all of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (subject to the release mechanism in the
Intercreditor Agreement) (including the Senior Notes Guarantees) must be satisfied prior to distribution to
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's equity holders. As a result, the holders of the Senior Notes may not
recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale of shares pledged in the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer. In addition, the value of the Issuer Share Collateral may fluctuate over time.

Pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes Trustee and holders of the Senior Notes will
(subject to certain limited exceptions) not be able to force a sale of the Shared Security or otherwise
independently pursue the remedies of a secured creditor under the Security Documents relating to such
Collateral for so long as any Senior Secured Liabilities remain outstanding and, if the creditors in respect
of the Senior Secured Liabilities enforce their security, they will have priority over the holders of the Senior

-----

Notes with respect to the proceeds from this Collateral. See "—The rights to enforce remedies with respect
_to the Senior Notes Collateral securing the Senior Notes and with respect to the Senior Notes Guarantees_
_are limited as long as any super senior or senior secured debt is outstanding." As such, holders of the_
Senior Notes may not be able to recover on the Senior Notes Collateral if the claims of the creditors in
respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities are greater than the proceeds realised from any enforcement of
the Collateral. In addition, if the Security Agent directs the sale of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's shares
through an enforcement of their first-priority security interest in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement, the second-priority security interest over such shares securing the Senior Notes and the
Senior Notes Guarantees may (subject to certain conditions) be automatically released. See "Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement"_ and _"Description of the Senior Notes—_
_Security—Release of Liens."_

**THE TRANSACTIONS**

In this Offering Memorandum, references to the "Transactions" are to the (i) Acquisition and our
performance of all obligations contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, (ii) Financing and (iii) PostCompletion Transactions, collectively, (with each of (i) through (iii) and any subcomponent thereof or other
transaction or intermediate step reasonably necessary to consummate any of the foregoing, a
"Transaction").

**The Acquisition and Acquisition Agreement**

On October 2, 2020, the Issa Brothers and TDR Capital (the "Shareholders") caused their jointly
controlled entity, Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited (the "Purchaser"), to enter into the Acquisition
Agreement with the Seller, a subsidiary of Walmart, pursuant to which the Purchaser committed to acquire
all of the issued ordinary shares of the Company on the Acquisition Completion Date (the "Acquisition").
The Purchaser, a limited company formed under the laws of Jersey, is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary
of the Issuers. It was formed by the Shareholders solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions
contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement and has not commenced any operations, other than as set
forth in the Acquisition Agreement.

Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the consideration payable by the Purchaser on the Acquisition
Completion Date will be £6,614.0 million (assuming an Acquisition Completion Date of February 16, 2021)
(the "Purchase Consideration"). Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Seller was required
to use commercially reasonable endeavours to cause the Company to make distributions to the Seller or
other Walmart Group Companies of at least £1,769.5 million prior to the Acquisition Completion Date. On
December 21, 2020, the Company approved a distribution of £1,769.5 million to ASDA Holdings UK
Limited, of which £1,269.5 million was a distribution in specie through the transfer of intercompany
receivables and £500.0 million was settled in cash. On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Company will
settle outstanding intercompany payables due by the ASDA Group to Walmart Group Companies in cash.

The Acquisition Agreement includes customary warranties by the Seller and the Purchaser. The Seller
and the Purchaser have also separately agreed on a dedicated indemnification regime applicable to any
losses arising from the Equal Value Claims. As contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, the
Acquisition will be completed following receipt of the FCA's approval, but during the pendency of the review
of the Acquisition by the CMA, which is the competition authority that has the authority to review the
Acquisition following referral by the European Commission. The CMA's review is ongoing. Currently, the
CMA is conducting its phase 1 inquiry into the Acquisition. If the CMA identifies competition-related
concerns over the course of this phase 1 inquiry, we intend to propose remedies to address these
concerns, which may include the sale of certain PFS sites to unaffiliated third parties. See "—The Post_Completion Transactions—Forecourt Disposals." However, there can be no assurance that any remedies_
we may propose will be acceptable to the CMA. If the remedies we may propose are rejected, the CMA
Clearance Date could be significantly delayed and more extensive remedies may be required from us,
which could potentially include a mandated sale of the ASDA Group. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties and risks, which could adversely_
_impact recoveries under the Notes."_

In connection with the CMA's review of the Acquisition, we expect the CMA to issue an IEO shortly
before or immediately after Completion, which we expect to remain in force until the CMA Clearance Date.
Under this IEO, the Bellis Group will not be permitted to exercise de facto control over the ASDA Group
or otherwise direct its operations until the CMA Clearance Date. As a result, although we acquired the
ASDA Group on the Acquisition Completion Date, we will not effectively control the ASDA Group until the
CMA Clearance Date. Furthermore, while the IEO is in effect, it will prevent us from making any significant
structural or organisational changes to the ASDA Group, including the Forecourt Business Disposal, the
Excluded Forecourt Divestments or any other Post-Completion Transactions, unless we seek and obtain
a derogation from the CMA. Accordingly, we do not intend to initiate these post-completion transactions
until the CMA Clearance Date.

**The Financing**

**_The Financing in the event that the Acquisition Completion Date occurs prior to the Issue Date_**

We expect to settle the Offering after the consummation of the Acquisition. In this case, we expect to
fund our payment of the Purchase Consideration on the Acquisition Completion Date using the Equity
Contribution (including Walmart's Rollover Equity Investment) and amounts drawn under the Senior
Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the Senior Bridge Facility and the Senior Secured Bridge
Facilities (the "Initial Financing") and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. On the Issue Date,
we will then use the proceeds from the Offering to repay a portion of the Initial Financing, including all

### 138


-----

amounts drawn under the Senior Bridge Facility and the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities (together with
the Initial Financing and the other related transactions described in this section of the Offering
Memorandum, the "Financing"). See "Use of Proceeds."

**_Utilisations of Senior Bridge Facility_**

On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Notes Issuer expects to draw the full amount of the
Senior Bridge Facility under the Senior Bridge Facility Agreement and to on-lend the amounts received to
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan. See "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements."_

**_Utilisations of Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and the Forecourt Disposal_**
**_Bridge Facility_**

On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer expects to draw the full amount
of the Term Loan Facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities
and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will on-lend the net proceeds
from these drawings along with funds received from the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Financing
Proceeds Loan to the Purchaser, to be used as described in "Use of Proceeds." See "Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements."_

**_Utilisation of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility_**

On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower expects
to draw £950 million under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, which will be on-lent by way of
the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Proceeds Loan to Midco 2. Midco 2 and its subsidiaries, in
turn, will on-lend the net proceeds of the drawing to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to a deeply
subordinated instrument, to be used as described in "Use of Proceeds." See "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility." To secure the Distribution Asset_
Disposal Bridge Facility, certain entities within the ASDA Group will grant first priority mortgages, fixed
charges or standard securities, as applicable, over the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and,
to the extent required thereunder, certain Substitute Retail Assets, as well as first-ranking pledges on the
Designated Bank Accounts. Prior to the execution of these mortgages, fixed charges, standard securities
and pledges, as applicable, entities within the ASDA Group are expected to enter into lease agreements
in respect of the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute
Retail Assets on substantially the terms summarised in "Certain Relationships and Related Party
_Transactions―ASDA Leases."_

**_The Equity Contribution_**

In connection with the Acquisition, the Shareholders and Walmart will cause Bellis TopCo Limited and
its subsidiaries to contribute to the equity of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or on-lend to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to deeply subordinated instruments approximately £1,280 million in
aggregate (the "Equity Contribution"), which includes the proceeds of Walmart's £500 million Rollover
Equity Investment and £780 million of funds raised by the Shareholders.

**_The Offering and the repayment of the bridge loans_**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering of the Senior Notes
to repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Bridge Facility Agreement, and the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering of the Senior Secured Notes to repay all amounts
outstanding under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities Agreement. See "Use of Proceeds."

**_Estimated cash and cash equivalents as of the Acquisition Completion Date_**

On or about the Acquisition Completion Date, ASDA will settle in cash intercompany loans owed to
Walmart of £409.0 million. In addition, on December 3, 2020, the Company announced that it will pay in
full its business rates for the UK tax year ending April 5, 2021 to the UK government (and the devolved
administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), thus waiving the relief it had received earlier in
2020 in respect of such payment as part of the UK government's measures in support of UK businesses
in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is estimated to be within a range of £320 million to £340
million. As a result, the Company expects to pay £254 million in retrospective business rates for the period
from April to December 2020, to be funded from cash available on the Company's balance sheet. The
Company expects to engage in due course with the competent UK authorities to discuss and agree the
exact terms of such payment, including its timing. ASDA also plans to resume its regular payments of the
business rates on a monthly basis commencing with the month of January 2021. The Company estimates
that its average cash and cash equivalents from January 4 to February 2, 2021 (inclusive), as adjusted to

### 139


-----

give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions on the Acquisition Completion Date and
excluding the amount earmarked to retrospectively pay business rates tax relief accepted from the UK
government for the period to December 31, 2020 was £505.6 million. ASDA's net working capital for the
month of January tends to be slightly lower than the yearly average due to the customary seasonal dip in
stock levels and the build-up of trade payables to suppliers in the early part of each financial year following
the Christmas trading period. ASDA's actual cash and cash equivalents available as of the Acquisition
Completion Date may however be different.

**_The Financing in the event that the Issue Date occurs prior to, or substantially concurrently with,_**
**_the Acquisition Completion Date_**

It is possible that the Acquisition Completion Date may be delayed until after the Issue Date, including
due to the timing of our receipt of the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. In this case, unless the Offering
is settled substantially concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, we will, pending completion of the
Acquisition, fund the gross proceeds of the Offering into Escrow Accounts, which will be held in the name
of the relevant Issuer, but controlled by the relevant Escrow Agent, and pledged in favour of the relevant
Trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of the holders of the relevant Notes, pursuant to the terms of the
Escrow Agreements and Escrow Account Charges dated on or before the Issue Date. Under the terms of
the Escrow Agreements, release of the Escrowed Proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain
conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition and the solvency of the relevant Issuer. Following
release from escrow, we expect to use the proceeds of the Offering, together with the Equity Contribution
and amounts drawn under the Senior Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and the Distribution
Asset Disposal Bridge Facility (as described above and in "Use of Proceeds.") to fund our payment of the
Purchase Consideration on the Acquisition Completion Date. In the event we deposit the gross proceeds
of the Offering into the Escrow Accounts on the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date has not
occurred, or the conditions to the release of such Escrowed Proceeds have not been satisfied, on or before
the Outside Date, Midco has not elected to extend the initial Shortfall Agreement Termination Date (or any
extension thereof) and the Release has not occurred as at such date or in certain other circumstances,
subject to certain conditions, the Notes will be mandatorily redeemable at a price equal to 100% of the
aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to, but not
including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date and Additional Amounts, if any.

If the Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, we will forgo
these escrow procedures and will instead retain the proceeds of the Offering to fund part of the
consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement on the Acquisition Completion Date. See "Use of
_Proceeds," "Description of the Senior Notes—Acquisition Agreement, Timing of Completion Date and_
_Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds" and "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Acquisition Agreement,_
_Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds."_

**The Post-Completion Transactions**

**_Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility_**

Following the CMA Clearance Date, ASDA will transfer the Warehouse Assets, the balances credited
to the Designated Bank Accounts, and to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility, Substitute Retail Assets and Select Retail Assets, to Propco 2 or other affiliates who are
obligors thereunder (the "Post-Completion Disposals") in exchange for consideration left outstanding
(the "Post-Completion Disposal Receivables"). Alternatively, Select Retail Assets and, as relevant,
Substitute Retail Assets may remain held by the ASDA Group but will continue to be charged in favour of
the lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility as described in the paragraph below.
ASDA will agree to subordinate its claims against Propco 2 or such other affiliates to those of lenders
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility pursuant to a separate subordination agreement. The
transfers of each of the Warehouse Assets and, to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution
Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, Substitute Retail Assets and Select Retail Assets in connection with the
Post-Completion Disposals will be subject to the ASDA Leases, which will remain in effect. To the extent
any part of a Substitute Retail Asset or a Select Retail Asset comprises a Forecourt Asset, following the
CMA Clearance Date, if documents are agreed by such date, that part of the ASDA Lease which comprises
the Forecourt Asset will be surrendered (or, as applicable, renounced) and any security affecting that part
of the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be
released such that the intention is for the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset to be transferred
to Propco 2 or its affiliates (to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility) to exclude the title to the Forecourt Asset which will be retained by ASDA by way of a Forecourt
Assets Separation. If any relevant Substitute Retail Asset or Select Retail Asset remains held by the ASDA
Group at the time of the Forecourt Business Disposal, that part of the ASDA Lease which comprises the
Forecourt Asset will be surrendered (or, as applicable, renounced) and any security affecting that part of

### 140


-----

the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be released
and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will permit the disposal of the Forecourt Asset pursuant
to the terms of the Forecourt SPA by way of a Forecourt Assets Separation such that the remaining part
of the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset excludes the title to that Forecourt Asset. After the
Forecourt Business Disposal has been completed, (to the extent the Post-Completion Disposals were
made to Propco 2, rather than to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, following the
CMA Clearance Date) we expect Midco 2 to transfer Bellis Select Warehouse Holdings Limited ("Propco
**1") to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, in consideration of repayment of the**
outstanding balance of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Proceeds Loan. Please see
"Summary Corporate and Financing Structure."

Because certain third-party consents, approvals or certifications in relation to the grant of an ASDA
Lease, the grant of Third-Party Asset Security in respect of one or more Warehouse Assets or, in each
case, the registration of any such ASDA Lease or grant of Third-Party Asset Security may remain
outstanding at a cut-off point prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, entities in the ASDA Group owning
such Warehouse Assets may not be able to grant an ASDA Lease or grant Third-Party Asset Security in
respect of such Warehouse Assets at the relevant time. In this case, on or about the Acquisition
Completion Date, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into ASDA Leases in respect of one of more
Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the aggregate value of the
Affected Warehouse Assets and grant Third-Party Asset Security over such Substitute Retail Assets to
secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution
Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. In the event that the Land Registry (or jurisdictional equivalent) will not
register any Third-Party Asset Security because a deed of covenant is not in the prescribed form due to
changes required by the security agent under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility or third-party
authorisations are outstanding (in each case in respect of a Warehouse Asset), then an ASDA Lease will
be granted instead in respect of a Substitute Retail Asset of approximately equivalent value and ThirdParty Security will be granted over such Substitute Retail Asset. See "The Transactions—Post-Completion
_Transactions—Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge_
_Facility." If, prior to the CMA Clearance Date, outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications_
are received to permit the grant of an ASDA Lease, the grant of Third-Party Asset Security or the
registration of either of the following (as the case may be) in respect of any Affected Warehouse Asset,
entities in the ASDA Group will enter into an ASDA Lease in respect of such Affected Warehouse Asset
(to the extent not already entered into) and grant Third-Party Asset Security over such Affected Warehouse
Asset (to the extent not already granted) to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. Third-Party Asset Security which
was granted on or about the Acquisition Completion Date over one or more Substitute Retail Assets with
an aggregate value approximately equal to the value of that Affected Warehouse Asset will then be
released and discharged, subject to the Third-Party Asset Security in respect of that Affected Warehouse
Asset being successfully registered at the Land Registry (or its jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of lenders
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.

If, following the CMA Clearance Date, requisite third-party consents, approvals or certifications in
relation to the transfer of one or more Warehouse Assets (in respect of which either an ASDA Lease and
Third-Party Asset Security have been granted or an ASDA Lease has been granted and requisite thirdparty consents, approvals or certifications in relation to the grant of any first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed
charges or, as applicable, standard securities to be granted by Propco 2 or other affiliates (and the
registration of the foregoing) have been obtained) pursuant to the Post-Completion Disposals or the
registration of any transfer in respect of such Warehouse Assets remain outstanding, entities in the ASDA
Group will enter into ASDA Leases in respect of one of more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate
value approximately equal to the aggregate value of such Affected Warehouse Assets. Entities in the
ASDA Group that own such Substitute Retail Assets will grant Third-Party Asset Security in respect of
such Substitute Retail Assets. To the extent required by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility,
such Substitute Retail Assets will be transferred to Propco 2 or other affiliates pursuant to the PostCompletion Disposals to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. Alternatively, such assets may remain held by the
ASDA Group but continue to be charged in favour of the lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility. If, following the date of the Post-Completion Disposals, outstanding third-party consents,
approvals or certifications are received to permit the grant of an ASDA Lease, the transfer to and the grant
of first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities (to the extent that
Affected Warehouse Asset is not transferred subject to existing Third-Party Asset Security) by Propco 2
or other affiliates in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into
an ASDA Lease in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset (to the extent not already entered into) and
transfer the Affected Warehouse Asset to Propco 2 or other affiliates, which will grant (unless the Affected

-----

Warehouse Asset is transferred subject to existing Third-Party Asset Security) a first-ranking legal
mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of it to secure the obligations of the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.
First-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities which were granted
over one or more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the value of
that Affected Warehouse Asset will then be released and discharged, subject to the first-ranking legal
mortgages, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset
being successfully registered at the Land Registry (or its jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of lenders
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. See "The Transactions—Post-Completion
_Transactions—Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge_
_Facility."_

If outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications are received following the CMA
Clearance Date to permit the grant of an ASDA Lease and the transfer of an Affected Warehouse Asset
to Propco 2 or other affiliates, but not the grant of a first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as
applicable, standard security in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset to secure the obligations of the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility,
such Affected Warehouse Asset may nevertheless be transferred to Propco 2 or other affiliates. If,
following such transfer, outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications are received to permit
the grant of first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities by Propco 2
or other affiliates, and the registration of the foregoing in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset, Propco
2 or other affiliates will grant a first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security
in respect of them to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. First-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as
applicable, standard securities which were granted over one or more Substitute Retail Assets with an
aggregate value approximately equal to the value of that Affected Warehouse Asset will then be released
and discharged, subject to the first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard
security in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset being successfully registered at the Land Registry
(or its jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.

If following the transfer of a Warehouse Asset, Select Retail Asset and/or Substitute Retail Asset to
Propco 2 or other affiliates, the ASDA Lease granted in respect of such asset is not held by ASL, the
relevant tenant is required under the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement to
assign the ASDA Lease to ASL with the intent that all ASDA Leases in respect of Warehouse Assets,
Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets held by Propco 2 or other affiliates are held by ASL.

If, following the transfer of a Substitute Retail Asset to Propco 2 or other affiliates, first-ranking legal
mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities which were granted over that Substitute
Retail Asset are released, Propco 2 or other affiliates may transfer such Substitute Retail Asset to the
ASDA Group in advance of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility being repaid in full.

The initial term of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is one year from the Acquisition
Completion Date, with the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower retaining an option to
extend it for a further six months at its own discretion. The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has
no scheduled amortisation and we intend to repay it in full ahead of maturity primarily with the net proceeds
from the Warehouse Sale Transactions we expect to consummate before and after the transfer of Bellis
Select Warehouse Holdings Limited to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, which
would have to be applied promptly in mandatory prepayment of the facility. Depending on market
conditions and expected transaction values, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower or
Propco 2, as applicable, may also sell some or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable,
some or all of the Substitute Retail Assets (in each case subject to ASDA Leases), the proceeds of which
would also have to be applied in mandatory prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.
We anticipate that the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower (or Propco 2, as may be the
case) will return to the Issuers, by way of contribution to their equity, in-kind loan pursuant to a deeply
subordinated instrument or repayment of Post-Completion Disposal Receivables held by the Group, any
Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets that it does not sell to repay the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility, and, to the extent such proceeds are not used to repay amounts outstanding
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, amounts equal to any net proceeds directly or
indirectly received from the sale of any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets (including any
Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds) (the "Retail Assets Contributions"). After the Retail Assets
Contributions have been made, we expect to distribute any remaining Post-Completion Disposal
Receivables to Topco, in the amounts that remain outstanding at the time, by way of dividends in kind and
anticipate that Topco would then arrange for such receivables to be extinguished by contribution to Propco
2. Subject to certain limitations, the Post-Completion Disposals and the in-kind distribution of the Post
### 142


-----

Completion Receivables will be permitted by the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement
notwithstanding the restrictive covenants or other terms that would otherwise apply to such transactions.
Moreover, these distributions will not constitute Restricted Payments under the Indentures and the Senior
Facilities Agreement and will not reduce the Issuers' capacity to make distributions or pay dividends in the
future. See "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—General—Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries; Extraction of Warehouse Assets and Select Retail Assets" and "Description of the Senior_
_Notes—General—Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries; Extraction of Warehouse Assets_
_and Select Retail Assets."_

In connection with sale transactions entered into by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility
Borrower, we may be required to amend the terms of the ASDA Leases. Such amendments will be
permitted under the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement, subject to compliance with the
covenants described in "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Affiliate Transactions" and "Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate_
_Transactions."_

**_Forecourt Disposals_**

On February 3, 2021, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and Bellis Forecourts Limited entered into the
Forecourt SPA, whereby the Senior Secured Notes Issuer undertook to sell to Bellis Forecourts Limited
the share capital of Acquisition 2 or any other member of the Bellis Group or a member of the ASDA Group
that holds the Forecourt Business, directly or indirectly, following the Acquisition Completion Date, the
CMA Clearance Date and completion of the acquisition by Acquisition 2 (or such other company) of the
Forecourt Business. Pursuant to a separate agreement, the EG Forecourt SPA, entered into on or about
the same date, Property Newco agreed to sell to Euro Garages Limited the share capital of Holdco (owning
in turn Bellis Forecourts Limited and therefore the Forecourt Business) promptly upon closing under the
Forecourt SPA. Property Newco may assign such separate agreement to the shareholders (i.e., Optima
Group S.à r.l. and Able Holdings Limited), who may sell Property Newco itself, rather than Holdco or one
of its subsidiaries. In preparation for, and prior to, the closing of the Forecourt SPA, we expect that ASDA
will distribute the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as soon as practicable following the CMA Clearance
Date. In order to effect the distribution of the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as a dividend in kind,
ASDA will have to arrange for the separation of the freehold or leasehold title to its co-located forecourts
(comprising the vast majority of the Forecourt Assets) from the parent title currently comprising adjacent
store or retail assets or sites by way of a Forecourt Assets Separation and the entities within the ASDA
Group that currently hold non-co-located Forecourt Assets will need to distribute such assets to Acquisition
2. We expect that the process of effecting these title separations and distributions to take several months
following the Acquisition Completion Date.

The headline enterprise value established under the Forecourt SPA, subject to customary working
capital adjustments, is £750 million, less the aggregate value of any Excluded Forecourts (and of any other
assets relating to the Excluded Forecourts). The consideration will be left outstanding at the closing of the
Forecourt SPA (the "Forecourt Disposal Receivable") and we expect it to be ultimately settled in cash
and in full promptly following the closing of the EG Forecourt SPA. See "Certain Relationships and Related
_Party Transactions—Forecourt SPA." The parties may decide to novate and assign the Forecourt SPA to_
another member of the Bellis Group or a member of the ASDA Group (as seller) and to a member of the
EG Group (as buyer), in which case the separate agreement between Property Newco and Euro Garages
Limited would be terminated and the Forecourt Business (or a holding company thereof) would be sold
directly to EG Group by the ASDA Group.

The IEO that is expected to be issued by the CMA will not permit us to sell any Forecourt Assets
pursuant to the Forecourt SPA for so long as the IEO remains in force. Consequently, we do not expect
to consummate the Forecourt Business Disposal before the CMA Clearance Date. The Forecourt SPA
requires us to complete the transactions contemplated thereunder as soon as reasonably practicable
following the satisfaction of the conditions precedent stipulated in its terms, which include the IEO to be
issued by the CMA ceasing to be in effect.

The CMA's investigation of the Acquisition is ongoing, and we may be required to take remedial action
to address any competition-related concerns the CMA may identify. If remedies prove necessary, we may
be required to designate certain Forecourt Assets (along with certain related assets) as Excluded
Forecourts and sell them to unaffiliated third parties (the "Excluded Forecourt Divestments"). Although
we will attempt to carry out the Excluded Forecourt Divestments by way of orderly sales following a
competitive sales process, there can be no assurance that the market conditions or circumstances of the
Excluded Forecourt Divestments will permit such an outcome, and the price we receive for any Excluded
Forecourts sold through the Excluded Forecourt Divestments may be less than what we would have
ultimately received in a fully voluntary sale. In addition, third parties may have rights over the Forecourt

### 143


-----

Assets (including rights to acquire and pre-emption rights) exercisable in the event of a transfer of the
Forecourt Assets (whether of the freehold or leasehold interest or of whole or part). In all such cases, the
transfer of those Forecourt Assets may be significantly delayed, prevented in part or prevented entirely.
See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties
_and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes."_

Under the terms of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the proceeds from the sale of both the
Forecourt Business Disposal and the Excluded Forecourt Divestment must be used to repay amounts
outstanding under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility until it has been repaid in full. See "Description
_of Certain Financing Arrangements—Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility."_

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

**Use of proceeds in the event that the Acquisition Completion Date occurs prior to the Issue Date**

On the Acquisition Completion Date, we will fund our payment of the Purchase Consideration and pay
fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions (including estimated fees and
expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering) using the Equity Contribution (including Walmart's
Rollover Equity Investment) and amounts drawn under the Senior Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge
Facility, the Senior Bridge Facility, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility. On the Issue Date, we will then use the proceeds from the Offering to repay amounts drawn
under the Senior Bridge Facility and Senior Secured Bridge Facilities.

The sources and uses of cash related to the drawing of the Senior Bridge Facility, the Senior Secured
Bridge Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility
and the making of the Equity Contribution are shown in the table below as of the Acquisition Completion
Date. The table below should be read in conjunction with "Capitalisation."

Issuer pursuant to the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan on the Acquisition Completion Date.

(3) Represents the cash injection that the Senior Notes Issuer expects to receive from its direct parent entity, the Jersey Security
Provider, as a contribution to equity on or about the Acquisition Completion Date, excluding the proceeds from the utilisation of
the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. The Equity Contribution will include the proceeds of Walmart's £500 million
Rollover Equity Investment and £780 million of funds procured by the Shareholders. The Senior Notes Issuer will in turn
contribute funds from the Equity Contribution to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on or about the Acquisition Completion Date.

(4) On the Acquisition Completion Date, Bellis Noncore 2 Limited will draw the full £950 million amount made available under the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, the net proceeds of which will be on-lent by way of the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility Proceeds Loan to Bellis Midco 2 Limited. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Distribution Asset
_Disposal Bridge Facility." Bellis Midco 2 Limited and its subsidiaries, in turn, will on-lend such net proceeds to the Issuers through_
deeply subordinated instruments.

the Offering will be used to repay principal amounts drawn under the Initial Financing in connection with
the Acquisition. Actual amounts may vary from estimated amounts depending on several factors, including
the gross proceeds derived from the Offering, the Issue Date and fluctuations in the applicable exchange
rates. Any changes in these amounts may be reflected as an increase or decrease of cash left on the
Company's balance sheet following the Issue Date or in a drawing under the Revolving Credit Facilities to

**Use of proceeds in the event that the Issue Date occurs prior to the Acquisition Completion Date**

We estimate that the gross proceeds from the Offering will be £2,750 million. If the Offering is
consummated prior to, and not substantially concurrently with, the Acquisition Completion Date, pending
consummation of the Acquisition, the Initial Purchasers will deposit, on the Issue Date, an amount in cash
equal to the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Accounts, which will be held in the name of the
relevant Issuer, but controlled by the relevant Escrow Agent, and pledged in favour of the relevant Trustee
on behalf of and for the benefit of the holders of the relevant Notes, pursuant to the terms of the relevant
Escrow Agreement. Upon release from the Escrow Accounts on or about the Acquisition Completion Date,
the gross proceeds from the Offering, the Equity Contribution (including Walmart's Rollover Equity
Investment) and amounts drawn under the Senior Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the
Senior Bridge Facility, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility will be used to (i) pay the consideration and make other payments owing to Walmart under the
Acquisition Agreement and (ii) pay fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions
(including estimated fees and expenses to be incurred in connection with the Offering). If the Offering closes
substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, and we will retain the proceeds of the
Offering and apply them on the Acquisition Completion Date as described above and shown in the table
below. The sources and uses of cash related to the Offering, the drawing of the Senior Facilities, the
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility and the making of the
Equity Contribution are shown in the table below as of the Acquisition Completion Date. The table below

**CAPITALISATION**

The following table should be read in conjunction with "Use of Proceeds," "Selected Consolidated
_Financial Information,"_ "The Transactions," "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
_and Results of Operations," "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements" and the Financial Statements_
(including the accompanying notes thereto) included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The as
adjusted information below is illustrative only and does not purport to be indicative of what our actual
capitalisation will be following the Issue Date.

The following table sets forth the cash and cash equivalents and the capitalisation as of September 30,
2020 (i) for the Company derived from the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements on an actual basis and (ii) for the Senior Notes Issuer, on an as adjusted basis to give pro
_forma effect to the Transactions as described in "The Transactions," as if each had occurred on September_
30, 2020. As adjusted cash and cash equivalents represent the estimated balance as of the expected
Completion Date, after giving pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions on the same date.

Total Equity[(6)] ........................................................................... 9,056.1 1,280.0

**Total Capitalisation ................................................................** **12,550.4** **6,903.5**

(1) Reflects ASDA's estimated average cash and cash equivalents from January 4 to February 2, 2021 (inclusive), as adjusted
to give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions on the Acquisition Completion Date and excluding the
amount earmarked to retrospectively pay business rates tax relief accepted from the UK government for the period to
December 31, 2020. On the Acquisition Completion Date we expect to draw £114.0 million under the Revolving Credit
Facility, but then repay that Revolving Credit Facility drawing from ASDA's cash reserves promptly after Completion. The
difference between ASDA's cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2020 and the Senior Notes Issuer's estimated
cash and cash equivalents as of the Acquisition Completion Date is due to current trading in the period and net payments
to Walmart of £909.0 million on or prior to the Acquisition Completion Date. ASDA's net working capital for the month of
January tends to be slightly lower than the yearly average due to the customary seasonal dip in stock levels and the buildup of trade payables to suppliers in the early part of each financial year following the Christmas trading period. ASDA's
actual cash and cash equivalents available as of the Acquisition Completion Date may however be different.

(2) On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer drew £750.0 million under the Forecourt Disposal
Bridge Facility. We expect to sell our Forecourt Assets in one or more transactions as soon as reasonably practicable
following final approval for the Acquisition by the CMA and to use the cash proceeds from such disposals promptly toward
prepayment of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility. See "The Transactions."

(3) Represents finance leases under IAS 17, without giving effect to IFRS 16. Lease liabilities recorded in ASDA's unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2020, prepared in accordance with IFRS, were £2,144.0
million.

(4) Represents loans from Walmart entities outstanding as of September 30, 2020, which will be settled in full on the Acquisition
Completion Date.

(5) Represents, on an as adjusted basis, net proceeds from the utilisation of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility by

148


-----

Bellis Noncore 2 Limited, which will be on-lent as deeply subordinated shareholder funding to the Senior Notes Issuer.

(6) Represents, on an actual basis, equity attributable to the owners of the Company as of September 30, 2020 and, on an as
adjusted basis, the Equity Contribution, which will be contributed to the equity of the Senior Notes Issuer. The as adjusted
figure presented gives effect to the Post-Completion Disposals as though they occurred on the Acquisition Completion
Date, but it does not give effect to the impact on equity of the transfer of the Forecourt Assets pursuant to the Forecourt
SPA. As of the Issue Date, we do not have a definitive estimate of the carrying value of assets and liabilities involved in the
Forecourt Business Disposal or the Excluded Forecourt Divestments, because, among other things, as of such date, there
is no separate accounting for the substantial majority of the co-located Forecourt Assets. The terms of the Forecourt SPA
are described under "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Forecourt SPA."

_the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 have been extracted from the audited consolidated_
_financial statements of the Company included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum or from the_
_Company's accounting records. The unaudited condensed consolidated historical financial information and_
_other financial data of the Company as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and_
_September 30, 2020 have been extracted from the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial_
_statements of the Company included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum or from the Company's_
_accounting records._

_This Offering Memorandum includes unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended_
_September 30, 2020, which is calculated by adding the results of operations for the nine months ended_
_September 30, 2020 to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subtracting_
_the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The financial information for the_
_12 months ended September 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be_
_expected for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 or any future period, and should not be used as the_
_basis for or prediction of an annualised calculation. The unaudited financial information for the 12 months_
_ended September 30, 2020 has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or_
_presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been_
_prepared for illustrative purposes only. Results of operations for prior periods or years are not necessarily_
_indicative of the result to be expected for any future period._

_You should read the information summarised below in conjunction with the information contained in_

been restated. The table above is thus presented on an IFRS 16 basis for 2019 and an IAS 17 basis for 2018 and 2017. Adoption of
IFRS 16 in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a decrease to operating costs of £31.4 million and an increase to finance
costs of £52.7 million compared with lease-related expenses charged in the prior year under IAS 17.

**Overview**

We are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom and the second-largest grocery retailer
in the North of England, Scotland and Wales (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a
52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). We operate a significant store estate of
614 stores (excluding standalone PFSs) that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom.
We also have the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery
Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). The graph below
compares our total grocery market share with that of other major UK grocery retailers.

(Source: Kantar. Based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020. *Ocado Market share
shown.)

We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by
favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household
expenditure on food and beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through
economic fluctuations. Groceries are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe
generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail
markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in
recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic. See also
"Industry."

-----

One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is
in turn centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to "Every
Day Low Price" and our wholly-owned supplier, IPL, which enables us to take a vertically-integrated
approach to procurement and which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other
key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and well-established George Clothing and
George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers and our team of flexible and engaged
colleagues. Historically, we have benefited from the support of Walmart, our former parent company. We
will continue to receive support from Walmart over the next three years pursuant to the Transitional
Agreements negotiated in connection with the Acquisition. For more information about the ongoing support
to be provided by Walmart, please see "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—
_Transitional Agreements with Walmart" and "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are_
_risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart."_

We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, our revenue was approximately £22.9 billion (including petrol), of which approximately
£2 billion was online sales, and our Adjusted EBITDA was approximately £1.2 billion (including petrol).

The chart below presents the breakdown of our 2019 revenue by product category (food, general
merchandise, clothing and petrol), food category (ambient and fresh and produce) and channel (stores and
online (including George.com)).

(Source: ASDA information. Year ended December 31, 2019. Note: Does not include £61 million of other revenue.)
Our differentiated operating model has resulted in strong financial performance: our successful financial
profile is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA
less capital expenditure) and cash conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA)
in recent years. In 2018 and 2019, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.5% (including petrol), our
cumulative free cash flow was approximately £1.7 billion and our average cash conversion was
approximately 70%.

free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019.

We believe that our business, operating model and financial performance also benefit from our
significant freehold real estate asset portfolio. See "Brokers' Opinions of Pricing."

We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we
maintain a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom. Within
the UK value market, we have strong market shares across ambient products (13.0%), fresh/chilled
(11.6%) and total grocery (12.2%) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52
weeks ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). Our offer is strong across the full food basket: our

155


-----

category market shares range from 12% to 14% (except household and toiletries) (in each case in terms
of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). We
believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to
internal ASDA data, our prices are approximately 6% to 7.5% less expensive than our traditional grocer
competitors (on a 2020 year-to-date (weeks 1-42) average, based on total goods price gap percentage).

Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is
supplemented by a large clothing and general merchandise business. We offer our entire range of food
and non-food products to customers as a convenient "one-stop shop" experience that is supported and
enhanced by our strong online offer. We believe our omni-channel offer, through which we reach customers
at our brick-and-mortar stores, through our significant online offering and on our app, appeals to our
customers. In 2020, there were approximately 9.8 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with
approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days
ended February 28, 2020), and approximately 723,000 weekly orders post COVID-19 (based on the
average orders for the seven days ended September 30, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has increased
use of and engagement with our online platforms and we currently fulfil approximately 720,000 online
orders per week. Our online grocery business operates from 350 stores, we offer at-home delivery and
customers are also able to collect their purchases at one of approximately 460 ASDA Click & Collect sites.
We are also expanding our 1-hour Click & Collect offer. Our business model integrates our store-based
and online offer by leveraging our stores to fulfil online orders.

Our online grocery business is profitable and has been consistently gaining market share within one of
the world's most developed online grocery markets. We have consistently outperformed the UK online
grocery market and increased our online market share in the last three years. According to Kantar, we
currently operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, holding 18.2% of
market share (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) as of December 2019, which
grew to 19.8% as of December 27, 2020 (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales),
representing a 1.5% gain and the second-strongest share gain since December 2019 amongst our key
competitors. The chart below shows the evolution of our market share as compared with our key
competitors for the periods presented. See also "Industry."

Our online business is already of significant scale: the chart below shows the growth of our online sales,
including a breakdown of online grocery versus George.com sales, for the periods presented.

(Source: ASDA information.)

According to Kantar, we are the second-largest online clothing retailer overall by volume in the United
Kingdom and we held 6.0% of the total UK online clothing (excluding essentials, footwear and accessories)
market by volume for the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020. Combined sales for our online grocery
business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion (of which £1.5
billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £1.9 billion in 2019
(of which £1.6 billion were online grocery sales and £0.3 billion were George.com sales) to a total of £2.7
billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 (of which £2.4 billion were online grocery sales and
£0.3 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR of 26% between 2018 and September 30,
2020. Additionally, our toyou service allows customers to conveniently collect and return orders from
George.com and other partner retailers at our stores. We have partnered with 119 brands and process
more than 10 million parcels per year.

With our team of approximately 140,000 flexible and engaged colleagues serving approximately 15
million customers each week (based on the average of weeks 39 to 42 of 2020), we are committed to and
deeply invested in the UK food supply chain.

Our business model is supported by diversification. First, we are a mass market retailer that serves the
entire UK population, in terms of both customer demographics and geography, with our customer base
skewing slightly towards value-seeking families, younger shoppers and lower-income customers who are
attracted by our Every Day Low Price strategy and with strong market shares in the North of England,
Scotland and Wales. For more information about our customer mix, see "—Our Customers," and for more
information about the geographic distribution of our stores, see "—Our Real Estate Portfolio." Second, we
believe we are well-positioned geographically, with a strong regional footprint across the United Kingdom.
Our store footprint is strongest in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Our large and diverse store
estate offers customers a variety of differentiated shopping formats. We operate 30 supercentres, 396
superstores, 155 supermarkets and 33 ASDA Living stores. For more information on our stores, see "—
_Our Store Formats."_

Subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, our 18 standalone PFSs and 305 co-located PFSs (including
both their underlying real estate assets and their business operations) will be sold to EG Group pursuant
to the Forecourt Business Disposal. However, to the extent we are required to do so in order to obtain
regulatory approval for the Acquisition, we will sell all or part of our forecourt business to third parties. In
addition, we will transfer to Propco 2 (or an affiliate) the real estate relating to the Warehouse Assets, and
to the extent required pursuant to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, the Select Retail Assets
and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets promptly following the CMA Clearance Date. We
will continue to operate the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the
Substitute Retail Assets pursuant to the ASDA Leases which will be put in place in accordance with the
terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. For more information, see "The Transactions—The
_Post Completion Disposals." This "Business" section, including historical statements herein, principally_
relates the ASDA's business as it will be following the completion of the Transactions.

Following the completion of the Acquisition, we will continue to benefit over the next three years from
support provided by Walmart, the world's largest retailer, through the Transitional Agreements. See
"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart" and "Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA_
_from Walmart." In addition to the Transitional Agreements, we have also agreed with Walmart to set up_

separation planning working groups to ensure a smooth transition. Our ongoing relationship with Walmart
is expected to bring a number of benefits, in particular:

## • Information and technology support to facilitate the change from the Walmart ecosystem;

 • Deep research and development expertise and capabilities;

 • Global sourcing, leveraging Walmart's sourcing capabilities in clothing and general merchandise;

 • Best practices, leveraging Walmart's expertise and experience as a leading global retailer; and

 • Long-term support and continued partnership with Walmart's management and leadership.

The chart below shows our SG&A expenses (including petrol expenses) by type and as a percentage

**Segment Reporting**

We are engaged in a single reportable operating segment of business: the retailing of food, clothing,
general merchandise, petrol and services in a single geographical segment, the United Kingdom, and
online. All significant revenue is generated by the sale of goods through retail outlets in the United Kingdom
and through the Company's online channels. The operations of all product areas of the business are subject
to similar economic characteristics and are sold in a similar retail environment.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

Our results of operations are affected by a combination of factors. This section discusses key factors
that we believe have had a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition during the
periods under review, as well as those that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our results of
operations and financial condition in the future. While we believe that our results of operations and financial
condition, and particularly the results of operations and financial condition during the periods under review,
have been primarily affected by the following key factors, these factors are not exhaustive, and the entirety
of this Offering Memorandum should be reviewed, particularly the "Risk Factors" section. Additionally,
although we believe that the underlying operating trends that have benefitted our business in recent years,
as described further below, are relatively stable and will generally continue to drive relatively steady
patterns of revenue and EBITDA metrics, it is difficult to predict future performance with any degree of
certainty.

_COVID-19_

The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 was confirmed in the United Kingdom in early 2020 and is
resulting in a high level of uncertainty and disruption to UK economic, social and political activity. The
COVID-19 pandemic resulted in national and local authorities mandating or recommending various
restrictions and other measures throughout most of 2020, including mandatory business restrictions and
closures and social distancing, quarantine and lockdown measures. These restrictions and measures,
which were intended to slow the spread of the virus and protect lives, have resulted in significant job losses
across the United Kingdom and are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign

159


-----

economies for an unknown length of time. The effect of economic stabilisation efforts, including government
payments, relief and other support to affected citizens, businesses and industries, as well as future
lockdown and containment measures, is uncertain.

While our grocery operations have been classified as an essential business in all locations in which we
operate and have remained open to serve the needs of our customers since the outbreak in early 2020,
our business has been, and we expect will continue to be, significantly impacted by COVID-19.

The risks and uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 are broad, however below is a list of factors we
consider to be relevant, based on an assessment of the principal financial impacts which have affected us
since the start of the pandemic:

    - customer trends: changes in both the demand for our products as well as the methods in which

customers procure our products, including:

o a net increase in demand for groceries purchased through retail outlets during periods
of national and regional lockdowns and other disruptions, given restrictions in place
limiting customers' ability to purchase food from non-retail outlets, such as restaurants;

o a net increase in the demand for certain categories of products, such as staple cooking
ingredients and baking products, which correlate to apparent increases in at-home
cooking, baking and eating by consumers;

o a substantial increase in demand for and engagement with online grocery retail
offerings, including both home delivery and Click-and-Collect options, as a result of
government restrictions on movement and travel and customer fears of exposure to
COVID-19; and

o reduced customer demand for clothing lines, reflecting deteriorating consumer
sentiment;

    - supply chain: impacts on availability of, and significant short-term increases in customer demand

for, certain products, including;

o supply chain risks relating to goods produced in areas of significant COVID-19 outbreak
or other disruption from suppliers due to financial or operational difficulties;

o periods of increased customer demand for certain staple inventory items, such as toilet
paper, water, meat, beans, pasta and bread, as well as cleaning supplies and protective
equipment, which have at times been, and may in the future again be, in short supply
as a result of stockpiling and increased at-home consumption; and

o periodic increases in inventory levels to respond to increases in demand for certain
products, which may result in excess inventory, resulting in elevated working capital
levels and holdings of inventory that we may be unable to sell, or have to sell at
discounted prices if demand declines more abruptly than expected and which have,
resulted in compensatory payments to suppliers for reduced or cancelled orders;

    - colleagues: incremental costs related to COVID-19 related impacts on staffing needs and

compensation, including:

o a significant increase in colleague absences caused by illness, quarantine or
government mandates, resulting in increased overtime and other extraordinary labour
costs in order to compensate for such absences;

o extraordinary bonuses and other payroll increases or benefits paid to our front-line
colleagues; and

o additional payroll-related costs to meet increases in sales demand (particularly in order
to fulfil elevated numbers of online orders) and to ensure adherence to ASDA safety
initiatives, including the introduction of safety marshals across our store estate;

    - operational and other costs: increased operational and other costs incurred as a result of COVID
19 and measures taken in reaction thereto, as well as to protect the health and safety of
customers and colleagues, including:

o investments in personal protective equipment for our front-line colleagues, as well as

160


-----

enhanced and more frequent store sanitation practices, including application of antimicrobial protective coating to store trolleys and baskets;

o investments in our stores to ensure adherence to safety recommendations and
requirements, including placement of hand sanitising stations throughout stores,
addition of Perspex screens at checkouts and kiosks and placement of additional
signage and two-meter markers throughout stores to assist compliance with safety and
social distancing measures;

o one-off COVID-19 related costs, such as rental payment holidays granted to certain
concession vendors;

o charitable contributions to hunger relief to help feed families in need during the COVID19 pandemic and ensure that they get the food they need, which reflect ASDA's core
principles; and

o a temporary pause in our capital investment programme in order to protect customers,
colleagues and suppliers during the initial phase of the pandemic.

    - government: impacts of government measures taken to limit the spread of COVID-19, as well as

to mitigate the economic consequences of such government measures:

o adverse impacts on the ASDA Group's operations and costs as a result of laws,
regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, which have been and
continue to be uncertain and difficult to predict.

We consider that the principal risks and uncertainties associated with COVID-19 that have led, and
could continue to lead, to a significant financial impact on our business relate, in particular, to product
availability, colleague absence and restrictions on customers' ability to physically access stores. We have
implemented measures to address these principal risks, including plans in place to protect product
availability, to provide cover for increases in levels of colleague absence and to maximise access to ASDA
for customers who are considered most vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19.

We believe that during the first UK lockdown, consumers strongly favoured supermarkets and
convenience stores that were close to their homes as they responded to the UK government's "stay at
home" message. During the second lockdown, we believe that the change in message from "stay at home"
resulted in customers being willing to travel further during the lockdown, which supported footfall in out-oftown shops. As a result, we generally performed somewhat behind the market during first lockdown, which
we believe was largely driven by not having a convenience offering as well as by consumer hesitation to
venture far from home, while we generally performed somewhat ahead of the market during the second
lockdown, which we believe reflects greater consumer willingness to return to more ordinary shopping
habits as well as the appeal of one-stop shopping experiences, which we believe has benefitted us. This
appeal was further supported by strong promotional and pricing activity during the second lockdown period.

Structural shifts due to COVID-19 have led to increased overall growth in the grocery retail market.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, customer behaviour has changed, with a shift away from out-of-home
food consumption towards at-home food consumption, to the benefit of the UK grocery retail market. The
chart below shows COVID-19-accelerated channel shifts over the periods presented. For further
information on prevailing trends in the grocery retail market and, in particular, the recent channel shifts
which have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, please see "Industry."

(Source: Kantar Worldpanel, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a year-to-date basis ended December 27, 2020.)

Grocery sales have grown by 12.3% between December 1, 2019 and December 27, 2020, according
to Kantar, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales. Changes to consumer behaviour that have positively
benefitted the grocery market during the COVID-19 pandemic include: increased consumption of food at
home, a shift to online shopping channels, increased preference for shopping locally, in particular during
the first UK lockdown (which we believe benefitted retail groups with a strong convenience store presence),
and an increased focus on food safety, hygiene and health.

Despite significant challenges posed by COVID-19, our business has remained resilient, supported by
a well-developed online channel which saw significant growth through the government-imposed lockdowns
as customer behaviour evolved. We were able to quickly increase the capacity of our online offer in
response to increased demand driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, gaining market share and improving
the profitability of our online business.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have benefitted from healthy revenue growth driven by higher food
sales volumes (which were in turn driven by stockpiling and increased customer demand for in-home
groceries via the online grocery channel), while margins contracted due to adverse changes in sales and
product mix resulting from decreases in clothing sales, which impacted the George Clothing brand, the
temporary closure of 33 ASDA Living stores and the shift in product mix within the food category away
from higher-margin categories, such as food-to-go, and towards lower-margin categories, such as beer,
wine and spirits and meat, which factors were partially offset by lower levels of promotional activity and
stronger general merchandise sales. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product
categories generally have higher margins than our food product categories. Profitability was also adversely
impacted by COVID-19-related increases in operating costs, such as the increase in retail colleague wage
costs (driven by bonus payments, overtime wages and wages paid colleagues absent from work due to
COVID-19, as well as wages paid to colleagues who worked during such sick colleagues' absences, rather
than as a result of increased wage rates), increased cost incurred in connection with supplier goodwill
compensation paid to clothing suppliers, inventory markdowns on holiday ranges, enhanced cleaning and
related health and safety measures, as well as higher retail operating expenditures.

We have considered the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event: the
impact on future results and cash flows is difficult to estimate and we have therefore considered a range
of scenarios as described in "Accounting Policies" of the 2019 Financial Statements. See "Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—The impact of_
_COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to create uncertainty in_
_our market and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations for the_
_foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control."_

We believe that some of the changes that have arisen during and in response to the COVID-19
pandemic affecting our business and the United Kingdom as a whole, will be persistent and potentially
long-lasting, while others may be temporary and transient (for example, following the end of the pandemic,
there may be a shift of consumer preferences to more out-of-home dining). The ultimate significance of the
impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be dictated by the
severity of the circumstances imposed as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the length of time
that such circumstances continue, which will in turn depend on the currently unknowable extent and
duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the nature and effectiveness of governmental and other actions
taken in response.

In March 2020, as part of a number of measures to support businesses during the COVID-19
pandemic, the UK government, the Scottish government and the devolved administrations for Wales and
Northern Ireland announced full relief for rates charges applicable to certain eligible commercial properties
for the rates year beginning in April 2020 (and in the case of Northern Ireland, such support ended after
July 2020). This relief applied to a number of properties owned or leased by the Group and as such, no
rates charge has been recognised in these accounts for the period to which this relief applied. See "Risk
_Factors— Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—The_
_impact of COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to create_
_uncertainty in our market and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations_
_for the foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control."_

On December 3, 2020, we publicly announced that we would voluntarily pay business rates for the April
2020/21 year on the properties to which the relief applied. As rates relief was in place at September 30,
2020, no liability existed at that date and as such, our directors have concluded that the announcement on
December 3, 2020 is a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event per the guidance set out in IAS 10.
Discussions with the relevant local authorities relating to the timing of payment are ongoing.

_Competitive Environment_

We operate in the highly competitive UK grocery retail market, which we believe is undergoing a period
of significant structural change, characterised by factors such as strong growth and aggressive pricing on
the part of discounters (such as Lidl and Aldi) as well as the other traditional grocers, a shift away from
brick-and-mortar stores to online purchasing and the recent increase in like-for-like sales growth reported
by traditional grocers, all against the backdrop of the general political and economic uncertainty, as well as
the uncertain economic prospect of Brexit (including the risk that Brexit may, among other things, increase
regulatory and compliance costs for imports and products shipped from mainland Great Britain to Northern
Ireland, which we might pass through to customers) and the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the latter of
which has accelerated many of these trends.

Across all of our market channels, we compete with grocery retailers and other operators for customers,
employees, locations, products and other important aspects of our business. Our success depends on our
ability to satisfy customer needs more effectively than the competition. In order to do so, we have adopted
a strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and compete effectively against them on product
selection, quality, price, convenience of location and the overall shopping experience, among other things.
Our market differentiation strategy focuses on optimising our product offerings, monitoring our mix of
formats and store concepts, strengthening our brand identity through strategic partnerships and by seeking
out opportunities to increase omni-channel sales. Further, our strategy is based on what we believe to be
a well-established own-brand grocery offering, our large and diverse store estate that caters to our
customers' different preferences and our deployment of digital tools and online platforms and innovation
and a well-known and successful clothing brand, George, which was the number two clothing brand by
volume of units sold (excluding essentials, footwear and accessories) in the United Kingdom for the 52
weeks ended December 13, 2020, according to Kantar.

Competition may also affect the prices we charge for our products, which in turn impacts our revenue
and margins, although this is usually experienced on a product-specific basis. For example, a competitor
may cut its prices to attract footfall to its stores, which in turn may require us to respond with a similar price
reduction. We in turn have implemented various strategic initiatives, including our price investment in mid2020 and accompanying "That's ASDA Price" slogan and "pocket tap" PR market campaigns, investments
in new product development, particularly low cost/high-quality options, and accessing the convenience
market through our trial of the ASDA On the Move wholesale-convenience asset-light business model, to
help us remain competitive.

163


-----

Prices for most of our products are set on a national basis and, as a result of significant structural
changes to the UK grocery market, there has been substantial pressure on profit and EBITDA margins
across the industry, which has led market participants to engage in intense short-term promotional activity,
particularly through coupons and selective price cuts. At the same time, we have also experienced an
overall market trend of food and other input price inflation. For example, increases in the UK National
Minimum Wage and National Living Wage have led to grocery market wage inflation. Moreover, following
the Brexit referendum, the relative value of the pound sterling has declined as compared to other relevant
currencies, including the euro. As a result, we and other grocers have experienced inflationary pressures
relating to food prices, as the price of non-British sourced foods, in particular, rose in sterling-denominated
terms. In 2019, 45% of food consumed in the United Kingdom was imported, according to the UK
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Overall, we believe that UK food retailers are trying
to balance the retention of market share with their desire to maintain margins.

We manage this input cost inflation in several ways, such as by using our bargaining power with
suppliers, increasing or decreasing the prices of certain products to offset each other, through product reengineering, for example by maintaining the same price point and altering the weight or recipe, but without
compromising on quality and, in certain circumstances, passing through cost increases to consumers.
These changes, however, have put pressure on our profit and EBITDA margins during the periods under
review and we expect moderate input cost inflation to continue during the remainder of 2020.

We also monitor the competitive UK grocery retail market and trends at a regional and store concept
level and react to such trends by reinforcing our market differentiation strategy, as described above, and
adjusting pricing as appropriate in response to such trends. For example, consumer trends may include
sustained interest (despite COVID-19) in sustainably-sourced products and plant-based eating. We also
seek to identify and execute opportunities to increase our addressable market where appropriate, develop
new concepts and adapt our existing formats to meet customer demand and respond to market trends.

We also operate in the highly competitive UK clothing and footwear retail market through the George
Clothing brand, which offers a wide variety of low cost, high-quality clothing and apparel for babies,
children, men and women, including jewellery, footwear and hosiery selections. The George Clothing brand
was the number two clothing brand by volume of units sold (excluding essentials, footwear and
accessories) in the United Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020, according to Kantar, with
strong margins as compared to food categories and strong online growth in the past three years. However,
we face competitive challenges in the clothing and footwear retail market, which in the first half of 2020
experienced a significant downturn as a result of decreased clothing sales relating to the COVID-19
pandemic (see "Industry—UK Clothing and Footwear Retail Market"). Furthermore, we face competitive
challenges from competitors that continue to invest in their online and in-store presence. Such competitors
target some of George Clothing's key customer categories. As of September 2020, we completed a
reorganisation of the George business, which was aimed at developing an agile operating model in order
to enable us to retain and grow our customer base and further drive our value proposition. However, we
will continue to face steep competition on the basis of, among other things, the location of our stores; our
website and mobile applications, and their respective design; the breadth, quality, style, price and
availability of our merchandise; and the level of customer service offered. See "Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—Competitive pressures_
_in the apparel, footwear and homeware retail industries are high." For a further discussion of our_
competitive landscape, market share and consumer trends in the UK grocery retail business, see
"Industry—UK Grocery Retail Market Competitive Landscape."

_General Economic Conditions in Our Geographic Markets_

Our core grocery retail business generated 85% of our total sales (excluding petrol) for the year ended
December 31, 2019 and 87% of our total sales (excluding petrol) for the nine months ended September
30, 2020. The grocery retail business is generally relatively insulated from swings in demand related to
general economic conditions because consumer purchases of grocery and non-grocery staples tend to be
less discretionary than purchases in other retail categories. Certain of our other non-grocery offerings, on
the other hand, are more correlated to discretionary spending, and therefore, are more susceptible to
changes in general economic conditions. Such offerings, including George Clothing and general
merchandise, generated 15% and 13% of our total sales (excluding petrol) for the year ended December
31, 2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

Notwithstanding the overall resilient nature of our core grocery retail business, consumer tastes and
shopping practices are affected by specific economic conditions in the local markets in which we operate,
as well as, to a lesser extent, global economic conditions. Such conditions include employment levels,
inflation, GDP growth, average and minimum wage levels, real disposable income, currency exchange

164


-----

rates, consumer confidence and consumer willingness to spend. For example, we believe that when
consumers are confident about current and future economic conditions, our premium grocery offerings,
which carry higher margins, are more likely to attract shoppers. Moreover, we believe that consumers with
rising disposal incomes are more likely to make impulse purchases, which can be margin accretive and lift
average basket sizes. During times of economic stress, such as during the 2007-2009 global financial
crisis, basket sizes may tend to decrease while frequency of trips increases. Additionally, during a
recessionary environment, we may also record more purchases of our affordably-priced and attractive midtier and opening price point own-brand products relative to local and international third-party branded
goods.

According to data from the World Bank, the United Kingdom has some of the strongest macroeconomic
indicators globally and in Europe, ranking as the sixth largest economy globally, and the second-largest in
Europe by real GDP. According to the ONS, the United Kingdom's real gross domestic product ("GDP")
amounted to £2.3 trillion in 2019. According to Fitch Solutions, although the United Kingdom's GDP is
projected to have declined by 9.0% in 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, GDP is expected to rebound in
2021 and return to pre-COVID-19 levels and stabilise by 2023, with an average expected GDP growth of
approximately 1.7% from 2023 to 2025. Other general economic conditions in the United Kingdom have
also been favourable in recent years. According to Fitch, GDP increased by 1.7%, 1.3% and 1.3% between
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, which translated into stable household
expenditure on groceries. For the nine-month period ending September 30, 2020, GDP in the United
Kingdom declined by approximately 8.6%, according to ONS. Average weekly household spend on food
and non-alcoholic drinks as a percentage of total household spend was 10.5%, 10.6% and 10.6% between
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively.

For a further discussion of the macroeconomic conditions in the UK grocery retail market and the trends
affecting its growth, see "Industry."

Additionally, there are a number of ways in which Brexit could have an impact on our business, results
of operations and prospects. There are two areas in which we believe the potential for Brexit impacts on
our business to be most relevant: non-tariff barriers to trade and Northern Ireland. As regards non-tariff
barriers to trade, we believe that delays at port could pose a significant risk relating to fresh produce
imported from the EU. We believe that all of the major UK grocery operators are exposed to a similar risk
in this respect. We have a port delay risk mitigation plan in place, which we also would deploy in case of
other disturbance events and which we would use to re-direct shipments from Calais to other ports if
needed. As regards Northern Ireland, we operate 17 stores in Northern Ireland and we are eligible for the
special provisions for supermarkets as we operate in Northern Ireland only and do not have any stores in
the Republic of Ireland. While "supermarket solution" rules have been proposed, we believe that significant
bureaucratic hurdles may result. We note that the EU has granted the United Kingdom a six-month
exemption from its ban on prohibited and restricted goods for products (such as minced meat) being
transported into Northern Ireland. However, this means that alternative sourcing will be needed from July
2021. We also note that current proposals would require significant re-labelling and classification updates
to products in order to sell in Northern Ireland.

_Sensitivity of Our Cost Structure_

Excluding purchases of goods sold, we have a largely fixed cost base in the short- to medium-term,
which does not fluctuate with sales volumes. Instead, our costs generally increase from period to period
based on the sensitivity of certain costs to inflation. We are able to control some costs to a certain degree,
such as those related to marketing and labour (via short-term contracts as well as adjustments to the
number of hours our colleagues work), but must maintain sufficient sales levels to absorb the increase in
our expenses in order to maintain or improve our retail margins. We have also been able to reduce overall
costs by leveraging our vertically integrated procurement arm, IPL, which is a wholly-owned supplier that
serves us exclusively and provides us with a cost price advantage by eliminating the "middle man" in our
supply chain. However, even after taking such actions, certain expenses such as rent, the price of food
ingredients, energy costs, energy taxes and other direct and indirect taxation are outside of our control.
See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business—We are vulnerable to fluctuations in the availability
_and price of food ingredients commodities and packaging material, as well as to fluctuations in the price of_
_electricity and fuel."_

Labour costs represent a significant part of our cost structure. Whilst we can adjust the size of our
workforce, where we have proposals to reduce our headcount, we have legal obligations to consult with
colleague representatives (including trade unions) and engage other labour force actors before proposals
can be implemented. The obligation to consult with colleague representatives may result in amendments

165


-----

to proposed reductions in headcount and therefore take time before we can implement such changes
should they proceed. Additionally, we are subject to laws setting minimum wages. During the periods
presented, the UK government increased the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage, which
had an impact on our cost structure and generally increased our costs, although this has been in part offset
by cost saving and efficiency initiatives. In particular, as of April 2020, the National Living Wage increased
from £8.21 per hour for April 2019 to £8.72 per hour. Any further increase in wages, energy, maintenance
or any other input in our cost structure which is not mitigated, can also affect our results of operations. See
"Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our failure to attract and retain qualified
_colleagues, increases in labour costs and social charges and other changes to wage regulations could_
_adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition."_

_Investment in New Store Concepts and Channel and Product Innovation_

One of the drivers of our results of operations is our ability to maintain our traditional customer base
and attract new customers through our ongoing investments in fulfilment capacity and development of our
operations, including the evolution of our network of brick-and-mortar retail stores. Our retail store network
is largely mature; however, we regularly evaluate the performance of our stores and have repositioned and
remodelled stores under new store concepts to improve our customers' experience and respond to their
changing preferences. For example, we have refocused capital expenditure on remodelling our existing
stores, in particular to realign store space and offerings to enhance our customer proposition and better
respond to customers' shopping behaviour. In October 2020, we opened our first "sustainability store" at
our Middleton superstore location, which is a concept designed to encourage customers to reuse and refill
their products, allowing customers to bring and fill their own containers with products such as coffee, rice,
pasta and other goods, as well as offering second-hand clothing and increased recycling options. We
generally incur initial and ongoing capital expenditure and pre-opening costs with each new grocery retail
store, although these store concept improvements are expected to require a lower capital expenditure
investment than the format refurbishments we have completed in the past. We are further responding to
shifting customer preferences through our recent trial of the ASDA On the Move wholesale-convenience
asset-light business model. We believe that this store concept will allow us to access the smaller
convenience market and is responsive to changes in our customers' lifestyles. This represents our first
entrance into the growing convenience market, which we have undertaken with in an asset-light approach.
We have also dedicated significant investment into the expansion of our online grocery channel, ASDA
Groceries, and our Click & Collect and toyou services to access new and existing customers who are
increasingly shopping online, a trend that has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to
continue to target operating model improvements to our online channel supported by developments in our
IT infrastructure.

_The Online Grocery Market in the United Kingdom_

The UK online grocery market was estimated to have a value of £7.1 billion on a Retail Value RSP basis
in 2019 and has grown faster than the overall grocery market since its inception, according to PlanetRetail.
We believe it will continue to grow substantially in the mid-term, fuelled by consumers shifting to online
channels and at-home consumption, which have accelerated through the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe
our growth has been, and we expect our growth to continue to be in the medium term, ahead of the UK
online grocery market. We currently operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United
Kingdom, according to Kantar, representing 18.2% of the market (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total
Grocery Absolute Sales) as of December 2019, which grew to 19.8% as of December 27, 2020 (on a 52week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales), representing a gain of 154 basis points and posting
the second-strongest share gain of any online grocery retailer since December 2019 and throughout the
COVID-19 pandemic. See "—Overview" for further detail.

The UK online grocery market is intensely competitive. We compete with traditional grocery retailers
that are active in the online grocery retail market, including Tesco.com, Sainsburys.co.uk, Waitrose.com
and Morrisons.com, as well as with new competitors in the online grocery market, including broad-reaching
e-commerce companies such as Amazon, which recently began offering online grocery sales in the United
Kingdom, including through its Morrisons@Amazon offering, and which expanded the rollout of its online
grocery service through Amazon Prime more broadly across the United Kingdom at the end of 2020, as
well as pure online players like Ocado, which has recently added Marks & Spencer food products to its
grocery offerings following the creation of a joint venture between Ocado and Marks & Spencer. In order
to retain our competitiveness in the evolving UK online grocery market, we continue to develop innovative
customer solutions, such as our Express Collection service which enables customers to place an order for

166


-----

collection within one hour while other grocers also explore rapid delivery offerings (e.g. Ocado Zoom,
Sainsbury's Chop Chop). Furthermore, we continue to invest in strategic partnerships that lead to
innovation and which we believe will drive further increases in our market share, such as our partnership
with Uber Eats, which provides express and last-mile delivery options for convenience groceries. See
"Business—Our Online Platform" and "Business—Our Tenants and Strategic Partners" for further detail.
We believe these broad-ranging online options, and in particular our in-store picking model, has bolstered,
and will continue to bolster, the performance of our online channel and our ability to adapt to shifting
consumer demands.

_Significant Real Estate Asset Portfolio_

We are supported by a significant freehold real estate backing from properties across the United
Kingdom in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, with 71% of our retail sites being freehold
(calculated as gross square footage of freehold stores as percentage of gross square footage of total
stores, as of December 20, 2020; freehold percentage also includes certain properties that are freehold
with a partial leasehold or which are leasehold properties for which the leases have been classed as long
leasehold for the purposes of this calculation as those leases have nil or a peppercorn ground rent). We
believe we currently own a greater percentage of our real estate (by square footage) than all but one of our
traditional grocer peers. See "Brokers' Opinions of Pricing" and "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Financial,
_Reporting and Other Matters—We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates_
_made or procedures followed in the third-party brokers' opinions of pricing of our portfolio of real estate_
_assets are correct, accurate or complete."_

_Accounting Treatment of Properties Used in Our Business_

In accordance with IAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment), land and buildings are stated at cost less
accumulated depreciation and impairment losses except for certain items that were revalued to fair value
prior to January 1, 2004, the date of our transition to IFRS, which are measured on the basis of deemed
cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation. Items under construction are valued at cost
and not depreciated. Depreciation is charged from the date that the assets are available for use. Assets
acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of fair value and the present
value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and
impairment losses. Following the adoption of IFRS 16, these amounts are classified as right-of-use assets.
When an item is disposed of or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from its continued
use, any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement.

_Expanding Partnerships and Taking Advantage of Synergies_

Creating a platform of partnerships has been key to reaching new customers and consistently delivering
innovative customer propositions that draw shoppers to our stores, driving increased sales in our core
grocery retail business. We have commercialised our capabilities and years of learning derived from our
retail experience to partner with various service providers who can deliver access to, among other services,
new convenience and delivery channels, where we believe there are significant opportunities to serve our
customers in new and appealing ways. For example, since July 2020, we have been partnering with
UberEats in 100 of our stores to provide a new delivery option to our customers. Certain partnerships have
also allowed us to focus on our omni-channel proposition. For example, we are currently trialling an instore and click & collect concession with the DIY product retailer, B&Q, that expands our reach to customers
in the DIY and garden channel. Additionally, we have developed partnerships with general merchandise
retailers, that leverage their authority in certain categories and will attract customers to our stores. For
example, we have launched a trial with The Entertainer which will see them take over our offering in
children's toys. Partnerships across our various channels will continue to be an important focus for us as
we continue looking for new ways to reach existing and new customers and to capitalise on our customers'
growing desire for convenient lifestyles, whereby individuals seek to accomplish multiple missions at once.
See "Business—Our Tenants and Strategic Partners" for further detail.

In addition to rental income payable from EG Group to ASDA arising from EG Group's proposed roll out
of ASDA Food to Go outlets, we also anticipate synergies stemming from incremental uplift to ASDA's
wholesale margin from the roll out of the ASDA On the Move wholesale-convenience concept, which is
currently being trialled by EG Group at three of their sites. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months
ended September 30, 2020 reflects an adjustment of £7.0 million based on the Shareholders' estimates of
the total potential forward-looking run-rate synergies that we expect to realise in the first 24 months from
the anticipated uplift to ASDA related to incremental wholesale margin from the roll out of the ASDA On
the Move wholesale-convenience concept by EG Group across its network.

**Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Information**

The comparability of the Company's historical financial information is impacted by a number of factors.
This section discusses key factors that the Company believes have had a material effect on the
comparability of its results of operations and financial condition during the periods under review, as well as
those that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its results of operations and financial condition
in the future.

_Seasonality of Our Results of Operations_

Our sales and cash flows are affected to a relatively limited extent by seasonal variations due to
consumers' shopping habits and, to a lesser extent, weather conditions. Family groups represent a
significant proportion of our customer base. As a result, our revenue has historically been comparatively
higher during the Christmas and Easter periods. In general, revenue shifts due to weather tend to be
relatively short-term, with impacts occurring within a given month, rather than across a quarter or a longer
period. From time to time, we may also experience reduced sales revenue if inclement or severe weather
reduces in-store footfall and impulse purchases, without concomitant offset by online sales. At the same
time, adverse weather conditions, such as snow or flooding, can increase customer demand for our online
offerings, although they can also adversely affect our ability to deliver products to customers. In this case,
however, increased demand for online offerings would not likely offset reduced sales revenue in stores
resulting from inclement weather, as online sales account for a comparatively small portion of our total
revenue (excluding petrol) (9.8% in the year ended December 31, 2019 and 13.9% in the 12 months ended
September 30, 2020). In general, our fixed costs, including labour expenses (other than related to seasonal
workers), real estate leases and SG&A expenses, are more evenly distributed over the year. Additionally,
our procurement and sourcing activities are also generally more evenly spread throughout the year, except
for a build-up in preparation for the Christmas season. While our financial calendar generally aligns with
our operational profile, we experience calendar effects when, for example, the number of trading days or
payroll periods in a given period varies from period to period or year to year or certain holidays fall in
different periods from year to year. As a result of the foregoing, comparisons of consecutive interim periods
may not be a good indication of our performance, and the calendar effects we experience may have an
impact on year-on-year comparisons of interim periods.

_ASDA Group Pension Scheme Buy-In_

During the year ended December 31, 2019, the trustees of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme entered
into an agreement for a bulk annuity insurance buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme with Rothesay
Life. This agreement secures the benefits of members and the transaction is expected to de-risk and
simplify the Company's balance sheet, is entered into with Rothesay Life, and insures the long-term
benefits of approximately 12,300 members of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme. The buy-in transaction,
which was enabled by a one-off final contribution by ASDA of £0.7 billion and a loan facility made available
by the ASDA Group Pension Scheme's sponsor, ASL (see below), has taken place ahead of a full schemebuy-out that is expected to take place in the first half of 2021. The transaction removes future ASDA Group
Pension Scheme liabilities from the ASDA and Walmart balance sheets, simplifying the business. The
agreed buy-out will also mean ASDA Group Pension Scheme members will receive an individual annuity
policy, issued by Rothesay Life, which will pay members' pension benefits in full. See note 1 ("Accounting
_policies") and note 17 ("Employee benefits") of the 2019 Financial Statements._

At the time of the buy-in, it was agreed that certain of the assets of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme
did not meet the criteria for transfer to Rothesay Life pursuant to the buy-in transaction and were retained
by the ASDA Group Pension Scheme (the "Illiquid Assets"). The sponsor of the scheme, ASL, agreed to
make a loan facility available to the trustees in an aggregate principal amount of £467.0 million with the
principal purpose of providing liquidity to the ASDA Group Pension Scheme to allow the trustees to pay
the premium in full under the buy-in policy with Rothesay Life, and also to provide prudent reserves that
are available to fund the operation of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme up to completion of the buy-out
and eventual winding-up (the "Pension Scheme Expenses"). The loan facility was set up on arm's-length
terms, including in relation to interest. From completion of the buy-in transaction any proceeds realised in
respect of the Illiquid Assets are required to be applied by the trustees to fund interest and principal
payments under the loan facility, to the extent such proceeds are not required to be retained to maintain
prudent reserves with respect to the Pension Scheme Expenses. Pursuant to arrangements agreed in
connection with the Acquisition Agreement, payments received by ASL under the loan facility that are
attributable to the Illiquid Assets are required to be paid to Walmart. Accordingly, the risk and reward of
the performance of the Illiquid Assets has effectively been transferred to Walmart. To the extent that
realisations from the Illiquid Assets are insufficient to cover interest and principal payments owing to ASL

168


-----

under the loan facility, ASL is obliged under a separate agreement to provide sufficient funding to the ASDA
Group Pension Scheme to enable the trustees to fund such shortfall. As the amount of such funding
provided by ASL to the ASDA Group Pension Scheme would be applied to repay the loan facility owing to
ASL, the combined effect of such transactions would have no net impact on ASL. ASL reached an
agreement with the trustees of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme to make a cash contribution of £214.6
million to the ASDA Group Pension Scheme on December 30, 2020. Such amount was applied to repay
amounts due to ASL under the loan facility on the same day.

_IFRS 16 (Leases)_

With respect to the 2019 Financial Statements, the Company applied the new IFRS 16 (Leases)
accounting standard, effective from January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, as defined
by the IFRS 16 accounting standard. The cumulative effects of applying this new accounting standard were
therefore recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019 (the date of initial
application), while comparative figures were not restated. Additionally, previous lease-related balances
including operating lease prepayments, onerous lease provisions and straight-line rent accruals have been
derecognised as part of the Company's adoption of IFRS 16. The 2017 Financial Statements and the 2018
Financial Statements have not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16 and thus cannot be directly
compared to the 2019 Financial Statements, and the Company has not otherwise restated comparative
amounts as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2018. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification
of leases as either operating leases or finance leases for lessees and introduces a single lessee accounting
model with some exemptions for short-term and low-value leases. The lessee recognises a right-of-use
asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to
make lease payments. The effect of applying IFRS 16 is to align the presentation of leases more closely
to that of owned assets, rent expense is no longer deducted in arriving at operating profit or EBITDA and
instead profit before tax includes an interest charge on the unwinding of the lease liability and a
depreciation charge on the right of use asset.

_Impact on lessor accounting_

IFRS 16 does not change substantially how a lessor accounts for leases. Under IFRS 16, a lessor
continues to classify leases as either finance leases or operating leases and account for those two types
of leases differently. Where the Company is an intermediate lessor, the classification under IFRS 16 is
required to be made with reference to the right-of-use asset that arises under the head lease. On transition
to IFRS 16, there has been no change to how leases where the Company is a head or intermediate lessor
are accounted for.

_Practical expedients and policy choices_

The Company has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach which:

  - requires the Company to recognise the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 as an
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application; and

  - does not permit restatement of comparatives, which continue to be presented under IAS 17 and
IFRIC 4.

IFRS 16 allows for certain transition and accounting policy options for companies taking the modified
retrospective approach. The Company has applied the following practical expedients at January 1, 2019,
but no others:

  - to rely on the previous identification of a lease (as provided by IAS 17 or IFRIC 4) for all contracts
that existed on January 1, 2019; and

  - to exclude initial direct costs other than those arising on leases with lease buy-out costs from
lease buy-outs (see note 11 ("Intangible Assets") of the 2019 Financial Statements) from the
measurement of the right-of-use asset on January 1, 2019.

With respect to all leases previously classified as operating under IAS 17, the Company has elected to
measure right-of-use assets recognised on January 1, 2019 at an amount equal to the lease liability,
adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the
balance sheet immediately before January 1, 2019.

169


-----

The Company has taken the following ongoing policy choices from January 1, 2019:

  - to account for any lease with a term of less than 12 months as a short-term lease, recognising
cost in the income on a straight line basis over the lease term and not recognising a right-of-use
asset and lease liability at the contract date;

  - to apply the IFRS 16 low value asset exemption threshold based on the value of the asset when
new, on an individual asset basis if deemed appropriate;

  - to apply a materiality threshold to all leases on and post transition: costs relating to leases with
total undiscounted cash flows over the life of the lease below a documented threshold will be
expensed as incurred and no right-of-use asset or lease liability will be recognised at the contract
date; and

  - to elect to combine lease and non-lease components prospectively after January 1, 2019: this
applies to all leases with the exception of IT and printer leases.

For more information, see note 1 ("Accounting Policies") of the 2019 Financial Statements.

_Financial impact of adoption_

In the year ended December 31, 2019, the overall impact of adoption of IFRS 16 on the Company's
consolidated income statement was a decrease in profit before tax of £21.3 million, resulting in a decrease
in operating costs of £31.4 million and an increase in finance costs of £52.7 million. In addition, right of use
assets of £2,263.9 million and additional lease liabilities of £1,979.4 million were recognised on the
Company's consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019.

_The Transactions_

Historically, the ASDA Group has had little external indebtedness. On October 2, 2020, the
Shareholders announced they had reached an agreement with Walmart to acquire the Company pursuant
to the Acquisition Agreement. We estimate that, following the Transactions, the Restricted Group will have
total third-party debt of approximately £4,721.0 million (of which £750 million relates to the Forecourt Assets
Disposal Bridge, which is expected to be repaid in full during the course of 2021). In addition, we estimate
that the disposals of the Warehouse Assets by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower or
Propco 2, following the CMA Clearance Date and the consummation of the Post-Completion Disposals,
may trigger a gain upon disposal and result in a net tax liability for ASDA of approximately £40 million. See
"The Transactions" and "Capitalisation." Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations
following the Transactions will be impacted by interest costs related to this debt and may differ from the
historical financial condition and results of operations presented in this discussion as a result of the
Transactions.

**Description of Key Income Statement and Cash Flow Items**

Below is a summary description of the key elements of the line items of our income statement.

_Revenue_

_Results of operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine-_
_month period ended September 30, 2019_

Revenue

Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was £16,589.4 million, a decrease of £183.6
million, or 1.1%, compared to £16,773.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This
decrease was primarily due to COVID-19-driven impacts. Petrol sales decreased particularly through the
periods of lockdown when there was decreased travel by car. Clothing sales also decreased as consumer
shopping habits changed in response to COVID-19. These reductions were partially offset by increases in
food sales, particularly in edible grocery and fresh food, which were also COVID-19-driven, both due to
consumer stock up behaviour ahead of lockdown and due to food spending shifting away from restaurants
and takeaways.

Operating costs

Operating costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were £16,098.3 million, a decrease of
£290.5 million, or 1.8%, compared to £16,388.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.
This decrease was primarily due to lower cost of goods sold, driven by decreased petrol and clothing sales,
lower business rates as a result of government relief following COVID-19 and lower impairment charges
following the impairment of two home shopping centres in the period ended September 30, 2019. There
was also a reduction in the expense of share options in the period, primarily driven by lower increases in
the Walmart share price. These decreases in operating costs were partially offset by higher cost of goods
sold, due to increased food sales and increased employment costs due to COVID-19, including paying
colleagues that needed to self-isolate and the payment of an additional thank you payment to colleagues.
Food cost of sales was also adversely impacted by the mix of products sold, with an overall shift to lower

173


-----

margin products. There were also increased operating costs as a result of the increase in online sales
participation, which incurs more costs for the picking and delivery of orders.

Finance income

Finance income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was £38.5 million, a decrease of £2.8
million, or 6.8%, compared to £41.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease
in interest receivable on loans was primarily due to decreased bank interest receivable and was partially
offset by increased interest receivable on amounts owed from group undertakings.

Finance costs

Finance costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were £49.0 million, a decrease of £18.6
million, or 27.5%, compared to £67.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease
was primarily due to reduced net interest cost on the defined benefit pension scheme as a result of the buy
in of the ASDA Group pension scheme. Following the buy in there is no longer an additional minimum
funding liability and therefore no interest charge on this liability.

Income tax expense

Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 amounted to £83.4 million, an
increase of £40.3 million, or 93.5%, compared to £43.1 million in the nine months ended September 30,
2019. This increase was primarily due to increased profit before tax and decreased available tax relief
surrendered from elsewhere in the ASDA Group: in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 £24 million
less in losses were surrendered to the ASDA Group than in the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement

Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 amounted to a loss of £8.0 million, a change of £31.6 million, or 79.8%, compared to
a loss of £39.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This change was primarily due to
fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S.
dollars and the settling of those forward contracts that occurred in the relevant period: losses were caused
by the GBP strengthening versus the USD over the period of forward contracts, resulting in the contracts
being "out of the money." The reduced loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is a result of
the GBP strengthening less versus the USD over the average forward contract life in the nine months
ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Forward contracts
have historically been used by the ASDA Group to hedge purchases against movements in foreign
currency: these are mainly forward purchases of USD in GBP that upon settlement are used to pay for
imported non-food goods for resale. These are effective hedges, therefore any gain or loss on the forward
contracts is accounted for directly in equity and the cost of sale of the goods for resale is recorded at the
hedged forward FX rate in the income statement.

Cash flow hedges net (loss)/gain during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts

Cash flow hedges net gain during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 amounted to a net gain of £18.1 million, a decrease of £16.3 million, or 47.4%,
compared to a net gain of £34.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was
primarily due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to
purchase U.S. dollars in each financial year and the value of those contracts not settled at the period end
based on the exchange rate at the period end.

Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income

Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 was an expense of £1.7 million, a change of £3.2 million, compared to a credit of £1.5
million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This change was primarily due to the tax impact of
cash flow hedges changing from a net loss in 2019 to a net gain in 2020 as described above.

Other comprehensive (expense)/income for the period

Other comprehensive expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 amounted to £75.2
million, an increase of £30.5 million, compared to an expense of £44.7 million in the nine months ended
September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net expense items not to be
reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods following the defined pension buy in transaction and was
partially offset by items to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result of cash flow
hedges, as described above, changing from a net expense to a net credit.

_Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December_
_31, 2018_

Revenue

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was £22,899.2 million, a decrease of £17.3 million, or
0.1%, compared to £22,916.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily
due to decreases in non-edible grocery, fresh food, produce, clothing and general merchandise sales and
was partially offset by increases in petrol and edible grocery sales.

Operating costs

Operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were £22,315.0 million, an increase of £201.7
million, or 0.9%, compared to £22,113.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was
primarily due to higher costs of goods sold as a result of increased petrol sales, increased inventory loss,
increased impairment charges, due to the impairment of two home shopping centres in the year ended
December 31, 2019, and increased share-based payment charges and was partially offset by lower costs
of goods sold due to decreased non-edible grocery, clothing and general merchandise sales as well as the
impact of adopting IFRS 16. IFRS 16 results in lower operating costs, as the cost of leases that were
previously operating leases and expensed entirely within operating costs are now treated as finance
leases, whilst the depreciation component of the charge remains in operating costs, the interest component
is now charged to finance costs.

Finance income

Finance income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was £54.8 million, an increase of £16.9 million,
or 44.6%, compared to £37.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily
due to increased interest receivable on amounts owed from group undertakings and increased bank
interest receivables. The increase in interest receivable on loans was primarily due to Wal-Mart Stores
(UK) Limited: the loan to this intercompany entity increased over the year due to interest not being repaid,
as well as additional loans being made to that entity. There were also increased bank interest receivables
due to higher average cash balances in the year.

Finance costs

Finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were £82.4 million, an increase of £46.2 million
compared to £36.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the
impact of adopting IFRS 16 and was partially offset by increased interest income on the plan assets in
excess of the interest expense on the defined benefit obligation.

Income tax (expense)

Income tax for the year ended December 31, 2019 was an expense of £69.6 million, a decrease of
£24.9 million, or 26.3%, compared to an expense of £94.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.
This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in profit before tax and was partially offset by decreased
available tax relief surrendered from elsewhere in the ASDA Group: in the year ended December 31, 2019,
£9.0 million less in losses were surrendered to the ASDA Group than in the year ended December 31,
2018.

Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement

Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement for the year ended December
31, 2019 amounted to a loss of £38.0 million, a change of £62.2 million compared to a gain of £24.2 million
in the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange
rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars and the settling of those forward
contracts that occurred in the relevant period: losses were caused by the GBP strengthening versus the
USD over the period of forward contracts, resulting in the contracts being "out of the money." The loss in
the year ended December 31, 2019 is a result of the GBP strengthening versus the USD over the average
forward contract life, whereas the gain in the year ended December 31, 2018 is a result of the GBP
weakening versus the USD over the average forward contract life.

Cash flow hedges net (loss)/gain during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts

Cash flow hedges net loss during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts for the year ended
December 31, 2019 amounted to £12.9 million, a change of £51.2 million compared to a net gain of £38.3
million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was primarily due to fluctuations in the
USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars in each financial
year and the value of those contracts not settled at the end of the year based on the exchange rate at the
end of the year.

Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income

Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income for the year ended
December 31, 2019 was a credit of £9.5 million, a change of £21.4 million compared to an expense of
£11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was primarily due to the tax impact of
cash flow hedges changing from a net gain in 2018 to a net loss in 2019 as described above.

Other comprehensive (expense)/income for the period

Other comprehensive expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to £113.7 million, a
change of £193.8 million compared to an income of £80.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018.
This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in items not to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent
periods as a result of the buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme as described above and a decrease
in items to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result in cash flow hedges as described
above.

_Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December_
_31, 2017_

Revenue

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was £22,916.5 million, an increase of £696.7 million,
or 3.1%, compared to £22,219.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily
due to increases in grocery and petrol sales and was partially offset by decreases in clothing and general
merchandise sales.

Operating costs

Operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were £22,113.3 million, an increase of £628.9
million, or 2.9%, compared to £21,484.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was
primarily due to higher cost of goods sold due to increased grocery and petrol sales and increased
employment costs and was partially offset by lower share option expense primarily due to lower increases
in the Walmart share price.

Finance income

Finance income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was £37.9 million, an increase of £25.4 million
compared to £12.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase in finance income was
primarily due to increased interest receivable on loans to Wal-Mart Stores (UK) Limited: the loan to this
intercompany entity increased over the year, due to interest not being repaid as well as additional loans
being made to that entity. The increase in finance income was also due to higher average cash balances
in the year.

Finance costs

Finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were £36.2 million, an increase of £0.9 million, or
2.5%, compared to £35.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.

Income tax (expense)

Income tax for the year ended December 31, 2018 was an expense of £94.5 million, an increase of
£47.9 million compared to an expense of £46.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase
was primarily due to an increase in profit before tax, as well as a decrease in available tax relief surrendered
from elsewhere in the ASDA Group. In the year ended December 31, 2018, £28 million less in losses were
surrendered to the ASDA Group than in the year ended December 31, 2017.

Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement

Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement for the year ended December
31, 2018 amounted to a gain of £24.2 million, a change of £60.1 million compared to a loss of £35.9 million
in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP
exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars and the settling of those
forward contracts that occurred in each financial year.

Cash flow hedges - Net (loss)/gain during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts

Cash flow hedges net gain during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts for the year ended
December 31, 2018 amounted to £38.3 million, a change of £72.7 million compared to a net loss of £34.4
million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to fluctuations in the
USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars in each financial
year and the value of those contracts not settled at the end of the year based on the exchange rate at the

end of the year.

Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income

Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income for the year ended
December 31, 2018 was an inflow of £11.9 million, a change of £24.4 million compared to an expense of
£12.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This change was primarily due to the tax impact of
cash flow hedges changing from a net loss in 2017 to a net gain in 2018, as described above.

Other comprehensive (expense)/income for the period

Other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to £80.1 million, a
change of £145.1 million compared to an expense of £65.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017.
This change was primarily due to an increase in items not to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent
periods as a result of the change in value of the defined benefit pension scheme's assets and liabilities and
an increase in items to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result of cash flow hedges
as described above.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

The Company's liquidity needs have historically been met primarily by cash flows generated from
operations. In recent years, the Company's cash-generative business, due to the nature of the grocery
industry, together with the Company's relatively low capital expenditure, has driven cash flow generation,
including comparatively high unlevered free cash flow.

Our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is expected to be our operating cash flows and
borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities. Our ability to generate cash depends on our future
operating performance, which, in turn, depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry
and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. See "Risk Factors."

Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings
under our Revolving Credit Facilities, will be adequate to meet our anticipated working capital and general
corporate needs for the next 12 months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient
cash flows from operating activities or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount
sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes offered hereby, or to fund our other
liquidity needs. The availability of our Revolving Credit Facilities is dependent upon certain conditions,
including compliance with a springing maintenance covenant as described further under "Description of
_Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior Facilities Agreement."_

(1) IFRS 16 was adopted on January 1, 2019. The modified retrospective approach was taken: prior year comparatives have not
been restated. The table above is thus presented on an IFRS 16 basis for 2019 and an IAS 17 basis for 2018 and 2017.

Cash flows (used in)/ from operating activities

Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased by £502.0
million, from an inflow of £199.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to an inflow of
£701.5 million for nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to increased
operating profit, a lower decrease in trade and other payables for the nine months ended September 30,
2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, a lower increase in inventories for the
nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and
to the Company having paid no further defined benefit pension contributions in the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 following the buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme in 2019. This increase was
partially offset by a lower add back of non-cash charges due to lower impairment expense as compared to
the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The change in payables was due to timing, with the year
ended December 31, 2019 particularly impacted by December 31, 2018 having a high payables balance,
as this fell just before a weekly supplier payment run. Additionally, movement in payroll accruals had an
impact, with lower year-to-date reduction in accruals than in the prior year and increased gift card payables,
as a result of increased gift card use. The change in inventory is mainly due to September 2019 being a
higher than usual inventory value, due in part to issues with excess clothing inventory that were
subsequently resolved.

Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 changed by £1,329.8 million,
from an inflow of £1,291.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of £38.7 million for
the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was primarily due to the cash outflow associated with the
buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme of £827.1 million (see note 17 ("Employee benefits") of the
Company's 2019 Financial Statements for further details), a decrease in trade and other payables of £385.0
million in the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to an increase in trade and other payables of
£242.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of having 53 weekly supplier payment
runs in 2019, a higher benefit from negotiating improved payment terms with suppliers in 2018 than 2019
and, due to trading performance, a reduction in purchases contributing to lower trade and other payables
in 2019, compared to a growth in purchases in 2018 and a reduction in operating profit of £219.0 million
relating to decreases in non-edible grocery, fresh food, produce, clothing and general merchandise sales
that were partially offset by increases in petrol and edible grocery sales. This was further partially offset by
a change in cash flow classification arising from the implementation of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, which
results in a higher value of cash outflows associated with lease payments being recognised within net cash
flow from financing activities, rather than net cash flows from operating activities.

Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by £1.8 million,
from an inflow of £1,289.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an inflow of £1,291.1 million
for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased operating profit for
the year and a lower year on year increase in inventory, partially offset by an increase in trade receivables
for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to a decrease in the year ended December 31, 2017

178


-----

and a lower increase in the share-based payment liability for the year ended December 31, 2018 than the
increase recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017.

Cash flows used in investing activities

Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 decreased by
£148.7 million, or 78.1%, from an outflow of £190.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019
to an outflow of £41.6 million for nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due
to the cash inflow from the partial repayment of the loan made to the pension scheme as part of the pension
buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme as described above.

Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by £288.5
million, or 88.6%, from an outflow of £325.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of
£614.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the buy-in of the
ASDA Group Pension Scheme as described above (for which there was no impact in the year ended
December 31, 2018), which accounted for £308 million of this change and which was partially offset by
reduced capital expenditure.

Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by £48.9
million, or 13.1%, from an outflow of £374.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an outflow of
£325.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower capital
expenditures, as well as higher interest received on cash held and intercompany receivables between the
Group and Walmart.

Cash flows used in financing activities

Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased by
£1,178.3 million, from an outflow of £213.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to an
outflow of £1,391.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily
due to a dividend of £1.15 billion paid in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and no dividends
having been paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2019.

Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by £112.9
million, or 51.1%, from an outflow of £221.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of
£333.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to reclassification
of cash flows following the implementation of IFRS 16, and was partially offset by a lower increase in
intercompany receivables between the Group and Walmart for the year ended December 31, 2019 as
compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due to the Group providing lower loan amounts to other
Walmart companies in the year ended December 31, 2019 than in the year ended December 31, 2018.
Lease-related cash outflows classified as financing activities were £182.5 million (as compared to £11.8
million in the year ended December 31, 2018). Although the classification of lease-related cash outflows
was impacted by the implementation in the year of IFRS 16, as noted above, there was no significant
impact from IFRS 16 on total cash flows.

Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by £384.7
million, or 63.5%, from an outflow of £605.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an outflow of
£221.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in
intercompany payables between the Group and Walmart for the year ended December 31, 2018, as
compared to a decrease in intercompany payables between the Group and Walmart for the year ended
December 31, 2017.

_Revolving Credit Facilities_

As part of the Transactions, the Group entered into the Senior Facilities Agreement which provides for
the Senior Facilities, including the Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group expects to draw under the
Revolving Credit Facilities upon the completion of the Offering.

The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for multi-currency senior secured revolving credit facilities in
an aggregate amount equal to £690.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facilities may be utilised by any Original
Revolving Facility Borrower or Additional Revolving Facility Borrower (subject to certain exceptions) under
the Senior Facilities Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, a Lender may
also provide Letters of Credit, Fronted Ancillary Facilities or Ancillary Facilities (in each case as defined in
the Senior Facilities Agreement) on a bilateral basis in place of all or part of its Revolving Facility
Commitment.

Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, loans made under the Revolving Credit
Facilities may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time. Such loans will be available to be used

179


-----

for, amongst other purposes, general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group (as defined in
the Senior Facilities Agreement) and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, to fund certain
permitted acquisitions, capital expenditure, certain fees and other amounts payable in connection with the
Transaction (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) and to backstop existing ancillary facilities,
letters of credit and/or hedging arrangements of the Target Group (if applicable) and financing or
refinancing any other transactions contemplated in connection with the Acquisition (each as defined under
the Senior Facilities Agreement).

The Group will be subject to certain customary affirmative, negative and incurrence covenants under
the Senior Facilities Agreement, which impose restrictions on, among other things, incurrence of other
debt, making restricted payments, disposal of assets and granting of security, subject to certain agreed
exceptions and permissions, qualifications and thresholds. See "Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements."_

_Capital Expenditure_

The Company typically has relatively low capital expenditure requirements. Capital expenditure has on
average amounted to 1.5% of sales (excluding petrol) between the year ended December 31, 2017 and
the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and has mainly been invested in store remodelling and real
estate.

The table below presents our capital expenditure for the periods indicated. For more information,
including the definition of capital expenditure, see "Presentation of Financial and Other Information—Non_IFRS Measures."_

**Nine months ended** **Twelve months ended**

**Capital expenditure ..............** **352.3** **366.8** **378.3** **213.3** **217.7** **382.8**

(1) Capital expenditure is a measure of assets received by the company within the financial period whereas the purchase of
property, plant and equipment and the purchase of intangible assets is a measure of cash outflow relating to the purchase of assets.
The primary reason for the difference in these two items is due to the timing of when the assets are paid for.

During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 capital expenditure focused principally on
replacing essential assets and refreshing our store estate. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2018
we also opened one grocery home shopping fulfilment centre.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, work started on a third George.com fulfilment centre in the
North East of England, with other capital expenditure continuing to focus on replacing essential physical
and digital assets and implementation of the store refresh programme.

During the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, capital expenditure activity was impacted significantly
by COVID-19-driven programme delays, but recovered quickly in the third quarter of the 2020 financial
year, with a continued focus on our store refresh and asset replacement programmes, and on the
acceleration of strategic change programmes to transform our front end and counters propositions, as well
as increasing online fulfilment capacity.

Our capital expenditure requirements vary from year to year based on, among other factors, specific
reinvestment requirements in relation to our sites and specific initiatives to develop our technologies, and
as such, we cannot assure you that our level of capital expenditure will not increase significantly in the
future.

**Contractual Commitments**

Other than our debt obligations described above and the debt we will incur as a result of the
Transactions, our contractual commitments are principally related to lease obligations and financial
derivatives. The following table sets forth our total contractual obligations and commitments as of
September 30, 2020 after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on such date
(subject to the assumptions set forth in "Use of Proceeds").

**Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements**

As of September 30, 2020, the Company had no material off balance sheet arrangements or funding
arrangements that would be classified as a contingent liability under IFRS, except for a contingent liability
relating to the ongoing Equal Value Claims. With respect to these claims, the Company has not recognised
a provision on the basis that any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings cannot be
reasonably estimated and any potential liability is only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be confirmed
whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic
benefits. See note 13 ("Contingent liabilities") of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial
Statements for further information on contingent liabilities. See "Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal
_Value Litigation" and "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters—From time to time_
_we and/or our management are subject to claims that can result in litigation, arbitration, tax or regulatory_
_proceedings which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability."_

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Financial Risk Overview**

_Overview_

In the ordinary course of the Company's business, it is exposed to a variety of market risks arising in
relation to its financial assets and liabilities, including credit risk, interest rate risk, liquidity risk, foreign
currency risk and capital risk. The Company has a risk management programme in place through which
it seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of these market risks. Following consummation of the
Transactions, we may hedge interest and exchange rate exposure. We do not enter into financial
instruments for trading or speculative purposes.

_Credit risk_

We believe there is no significant credit risk within the Company. The maximum credit risk exposure
relating to financial assets is included in their carrying value as at the balance sheet date. See note 13
("Trade and other receivables") of the Company's 2019 Financial Statements for further information on
trade receivables and details of recoverability.

The Company has established procedures to minimise the risk of default in relation to trade receivables
including detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted. Historically, these procedures
have proven effective in minimising the level of impaired and past due receivables. Surplus cash is placed
on short-term deposit with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Company's treasury
function, which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit. Deposit limits
and approved financial institutions have historically been dictated by the investment policy of the ultimate
parent company. Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses

181


-----

model under IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) and no impairment is required.

_Interest rate risk_

The Company's short-term borrowings have historically all been held with entities which are part of the
Walmart Inc. group and have been at fixed rates of interest. Amounts owed to fellow subsidiaries (see
note 24 ("Related Parties") of the Company's 2019 Financial Statements) accrue interest at a rate of
5.448% to 6% in the year ended December 31, 2019 (which was also the case during the years ended
December 31, 2017 and 2018). As interest rates have been fixed on all of the Company's historical debt,
interest rate movements would not have an impact on profitability, cash flow or equity in prior periods.

Following the Transactions and subject to the assumptions set forth under "Use of Proceeds," our
indebtedness and other debt arrangements will be primarily composed of the Senior Facilities, including
the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and the Notes (all of which, other
than the Notes, will bear a floating interest rate based on EURIBOR or LIBOR, as applicable).

_Liquidity risk_

The Company's Treasury function ensures that the Company continues to have sufficient funding by
monitoring rolling forecasts of the Company's cash flows. The Company's objective is to maintain a
balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of operating cash flows and
intercompany balances. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no external borrowings, other than
lease liabilities.

At December 31, 2019, the Company held cash of £1,929.3 million (as compared to £2,916.1 million
at December 31, 2018 and £2,171.7 million at December 31, 2017), utilised along with overdrafts where
necessary, to secure short-term flexibility. At December 31, 2019, the Company had committed overdraft
facilities of £30.0 million (as compared to £30.0 million at December 31, 2018 and £30.0 million of
uncommitted overdraft facilities at December 31, 2017), standby credit facilities, including bonds of £96.7
million (as compared to £112.1 million at December 31, 2018 and £112.9 million at December 31, 2017),
and committed lines of credit facilities of £30.0 million (as compared to £125.0 million at December 31,
2018 and uncommitted lines of credit facilities £125.0 million at December 31, 2017). The Company also
has historically had access to an intercompany financing facility which gives ASDA the ability to borrow
from other Walmart entities and which is available to other subsidiaries of Walmart, the limit of which
depends on the usage by fellow subsidiaries. This intercompany financing facility will be terminated upon
the completion of the Acquisition.

_Foreign currency risk_

The Company purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling.
Cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US dollars and euro. Some
purchases in US dollars are managed through the use of forward contracts.

The Company implements hedge accounting and had forward currency hedging contracts outstanding
at December 31, 2019, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars.
The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases.
The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the
commitments and none exceed a period of more than 12 months after December 31, 2019. Amounts
recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged
transaction affects profit or loss.

The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as
at December 31, 2019, a net unrealised loss of £11.8 million (as compared to a net unrealised gain of
£29.6 million as at December 31, 2018 and a net unrealised loss of £21.0 million as at December 31,
2017) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of hedging contracts. The net loss recognised in other
comprehensive income during the year in respect of these hedging contracts was £41.4 million (as
compared to a net gain of £50.6 million as at December 31, 2018 and a net loss of £57.8 million as at
December 31, 2017). This consists of £38.0 million of gains reclassified to the income statement during
the year (as compared to £24.2 million of losses as at December 31, 2018 and £35.9 million of gains as
at December 31, 2017), a £12.9 million loss on not-yet-matured contracts during the year (as compared
to a £38.3 million gain as at December 31, 2018 and a £34.4 million loss as at December 31, 2017) and
a £9.5 million taxation credit (as compared to a £11.9 million charge as at December 31, 2018 and £12.5
million credit as at December 31, 2017).

182


-----

Under the Company's hedging policy, the only items for which forward currency contracts are in place
are forecast purchases of goods for resale. The Company hedges up to 95% of forecast cash flows. Gains
and losses attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an
expense within the income statement upon maturity of the forward contract. Forward contracts entered
into which are not in line with forecast cash flows would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness.
No instances of this occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 (which was also the case during
the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018), therefore amounts recognised in the income statement
in relation to ineffective hedges were nil (which was also the case during the year ended December 31,
2018).

The Facility B will be denominated in euro and the Senior Secured Notes, Senior Notes, Facility A and
the Forecourt Assets Disposal Bridge Facility will be denominated in pounds sterling, and changes in
foreign exchange rates will therefore give rise to foreign exchange exposure with respect to the Facility
B.

As the Company manages more than half of its foreign currency exposure through the use of forward
currency contracts, changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on shortterm profitability or cash flow. It is anticipated that a 5% movement in the US dollar/pounds sterling
exchange rate, which represents management's assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give
rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of £29.7 million (as compared to a movement of £36.6
million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and £42.1 million during the year ended December 31,
2017).

_Capital risk_

The Company is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth
of its business. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company has historically had the
option to adjust the amount of intercompany loans payable or receivable to and from the Walmart Inc.
group of companies. There were no changes to the Company's approach to capital management during
the year ended December 31, 2019. Full details of the Company's approach to capital management and
how the Company defines capital is provided in the Strategic Report that is included in the 2019 Financial
Statements. Full details of the amount of intercompany loans payable or receivable to and from the
Walmart Inc. group of companies are disclosed in note 24 ("Related Parties") of the Company's 2019
Financial Statements.

**Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates**

In the application of its accounting policies, the Company is required to make judgements, estimates
and assumptions that affect the application of its accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical
experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant. Actual results may differ from these
estimates. Significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates are set out in note 1 ("Accounting
_policies") of the Company's 2019 Financial Statements, as included elsewhere in this Offering_
Memorandum.

**Overview**

The retail sector in the United Kingdom, across all sales channels, was estimated by Euromonitor in the
Retailing 2020 edition to have had sales of approximately £384.4 billion in 2019 (based on a Retail Value
Retail Sales Price basis excluding sales tax ("Retail Value **RSP") in current value terms) and to have grown**
at a CAGR of 2.2% between 2007 and 2019. According to Euromonitor, grocery retail – referring to the
sum of hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, and food and
drink e-commerce – is the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom and in 2019 it
represented £163.1 billion of Retail Value RSP (comprising approximately 42% of total retail sales). In the
past twelve years, grocery retail in the United Kingdom has not experienced negative year-on-year ("YoY")
growth, despite macroeconomic uncertainties and periods of food deflation measured by the consumer
price index ("CPI"), according to the OECD.

We operate in the retail market, offering a wide range of both food and non-food products and services
from our supercentres, superstores, supermarkets and ASDA Living stores, as well as through various
online platforms. The origins of our business are in the UK grocery retail market and, while our business
has grown and diversified into other markets including clothing retail and general merchandise retail, we
remain focused on offering high-quality, value-based grocery retail options to our customers.

Within the UK grocery retail market, we hold the third-largest market share, representing 12.2% of total
expenditure by households in the United Kingdom on specific grocery sectors (fresh & chilled, ambient,
frozen, alcohol, household, toiletries and healthcare) ("Total Grocery Absolute Sales"), calculated on a
52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar.

**UK Grocery Retail Market Sizing**

The following chart sets forth the growth of the UK grocery retail market size on a Retail Value RSP basis
in each calendar year from 2007 to 2019 according to Euromonitor.

(Source: Euromonitor: Retailing 2020 Edition. Note: The UK grocery retail market refers to the sum of channels, including
hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail as well as food and drink e-commerce.)

In 2019, grocery retail was the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom and was
valued at £163.1 billion on a Retail Value RSP basis, according to Euromonitor. Between 2007 and 2014,
the UK grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 4.3%. Between 2014 and 2019, the market experienced
limited growth, in part due to stagnant or marginally declining selling prices, which led to a CAGR of 1.6%
over that period. Generally, however, we believe that sales in the UK grocery retail market have
demonstrated resilience and stability through economic cycles.

The UK grocery retail market is expected to continue to grow in spite of the macroeconomic challenges
posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, both of which are likely to drive recessionary shopping
patterns.

According to the ONS, the United Kingdom's real gross domestic product ("GDP") amounted to £2.3
trillion in 2019. The following chart sets forth the historical and projected YoY real GDP growth in the United
Kingdom for the period from 2007 to 2023. According to Fitch Solutions, although the United Kingdom's
GDP is projected to have declined by 9.0% in 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, GDP is expected to rebound
in 2021 and return to pre-COVID-19 levels and stabilise by 2023, with an average expected GDP growth
of approximately 1.7% from 2023 to 2025.

According to the ONS, as set forth in the following chart the United Kingdom's population reached 66.8
million in 2019 and is expected to grow at an approximate CAGR of 0.4% between 2019 and 2031.

(Source: ONS.)

In 2019, UK households spent, on average, £61.90 per week on food and non-alcoholic drinks,
comprising 10.6% of average weekly household expenditure according to the ONS. Between 2007 and
2019, the percentage of average household expenditure spent on food and non-alcoholic drinks ranged
from 11.3% to 10.4%, as shown in the following chart.

(Source: ONS.)

Furthermore, the split between at-home and out-of-home ("OOH") food and drink consumption in the
United Kingdom has remained relatively stable in recent years. While the percentage of at-home food and
drink consumption as compared to OOH food and drink consumption increased by approximately 200 basis
points from 2007 to 2012 as a consequence of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the split remained
relatively stable from 2007 to 2019, as illustrated in the following chart.

Moreover, as shown in the following chart, the UK grocery retail market has continued to show positive
YoY market growth for the past twelve years. This growth too is reflective of the relatively essential nature
of grocery purchases, which represent a necessary and regular household expenditure as compared to
more discretionary spending categories, such as clothing, footwear and electronics.

(Source: Euromonitor: Retailing 2020 Edition. Note: The UK grocery retail market refers to the sum of channels including
hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, and food and drink e-commerce.)

While the overall UK grocery retail market has in recent years remained stable in many respects, market
channels and customer habits have been changing. Customer preference has shifted away from larger,
out-of-town formats towards smaller, proximity formats, with customers prioritising convenience and
shopping habits shifting towards smaller basket sizes coupled with increased frequency of purchases. The
industry has also seen the rapid growth of discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and Lidl) that compete
through differentiation on price coupled with a more limited selection of own-brand products. In addition to
these changes within the physical store channels, the UK grocery retail market has also seen an increasing
shift away from physical stores towards online purchasing. More recently, according to Kantar, COVID-19
has accelerated the shifts towards these online and convenience formats since lockdown measures were
first introduced in the United Kingdom earlier this year, as shown in the chart below. Underlying all of these
trends is a shift towards at-home food and drink consumption away from OOH food and drink consumption,
which has led to an 12.3% YoY increase in the value of the overall UK grocery retail market on a Total
Grocery Absolute Sales basis for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020. For more information, see "—

**UK Grocery Retail Market Competitive Landscape**

The following chart illustrates the UK grocery market breakdown by channel on a Retail Value RSP
basis and its development between 2007 and 2019, as well as the CAGRs between the years 2007 and
2014, 2014 and 2019, and 2007 and 2019.

(Source: Euromonitor Retailing 2020 Edition. Note: The UK grocery retail market refers to the sum of channels including
hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, and food and drink e-commerce.)

Grocery retail sales in the United Kingdom are made via multiple channels, including hypermarkets,
supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retailers and online. We currently operate in the
hypermarket, supermarket and online channels.

Hypermarkets are larger-format retail stores, frequently located on out-of-town sites or as anchor stores
in a shopping centres, with a primary focus on selling food, beverages, tobacco and other groceries while
offering a wide variety of non-grocery products, such as general merchandise and clothing. Supermarkets
are smaller-scale retail stores that offer a wide variety of food, beverages and household products.
Hypermarket formats are offered by the traditional grocers, while supermarket stores are offered by the
Co-op, Waitrose and M&S, in addition to the traditional grocers. Based on Euromonitor data, the sum of
hypermarket and supermarket channels constitute the largest share by Retail Value RSP of the UK grocery
retail market, representing 61.1% of grocery Retail Value RSP in 2019. However, in the last five calendar
years, growth for the sum of these two channels has declined, with a combined CAGR of -0.4% between
2014 and 2019, according to Euromonitor.

In contrast, over the past fifteen years convenience stores such as Tesco Express, Sainsbury's Local,
Co-op On the Go, Little Waitrose and M&S Simply Food, have gained popularity. In 2019, they represented
19.0% of Retail Value RSP and are the second-largest channel in the grocery retail market, according to
Euromonitor.

The 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the resulting weakened customer sentiment thereafter helped
discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and Lidl) to gain a strong foothold in the UK grocery retail market.
Between 2007 and 2014, discounters gained considerable scale and market share due to new store
openings and increased footfall resulting primarily from product offerings targeted at increasingly priceconscious customers. According to Euromonitor, the discounters channel represented 11.4% of the total
grocery retail market on a Retail Value RSP basis in 2019. For more information see "— UK Grocery Retail
_Key Trends."_

The UK grocery retail market has seen an increasing shift away from physical stores to online
purchasing, with online grocery sales having grown significantly faster than those of physical stores in
recent years. According to Euromonitor, in 2019 the online channel (food & drink e-commerce) comprised
5.1% of the UK grocery retail market. The online channel, which has also reported strong Retail Value RSP

-----

growth historically, with a 11.0% CAGR between 2007 and 2019, is driven by shoppers' growing appetite
for convenience and digital connectivity, as well as by service enhancements in online operations.
Following the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, this growth has been bolstered as customers
increasingly turn to online groceries in order to maintain social distance, a trend which may result in a
sustained change in preferences going forward.

On the basis of Total Grocery Absolute Sales for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020, we are the
third-largest player in the UK grocery retail market with a 12.2% market share, according to Kantar. Other
key players are Tesco (with a 24.0% market share), Sainsbury's (with a 13.4% market share) and Morrisons
(with a 9.3% market share), in each case on the basis of Total Grocery Absolute Sales for the 52 weeks
ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar. Together, the traditional grocers comprise 58.8% of the
total market on the basis of Total Grocery Absolute Sales for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020,
according to Kantar. Other grocery retailers include Aldi, Co-op, Lidl, Waitrose and M&S Food. Waitrose
and M&S Food operate at the premium end of the market and command lower shares of the market, with
4.6% and 3.3%, respectively, while discounters hold market shares of 6.9% and 5.2%, respectively, in each
case according to Kantar and on the basis of Total Grocery Absolute Sales for the 52 weeks ended
December 27, 2020.

The following chart sets forth the UK grocery market share of each main UK grocery retailer on the basis
of Total Grocery Absolute Sales for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar.

**_UK Online Grocery Retail Market_**

The following chart sets forth the UK online grocery market share of the top six UK grocery retailers on
the basis of Total Grocery Absolute Sales for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020 as compared to
the 52-week periods through December 31 for the years 2017 to 2019, according to Kantar.

(Source: Kantar as of December 27, 2020.)

The largest players in the UK online grocery retail market are Tesco, ASDA, Sainsbury's, Morrison's
Waitrose and Ocado (which operates a 50/50 joint venture between Ocado Group and M&S). According to
Kantar, we had a 19.8% market share in the UK online grocery market measured on the basis of Total
Grocery Absolute Sales for the YTD as of December 27, 2020, while Tesco, Sainsbury's and Ocado had a
market share of 35.8%, 19.5% and 14.3%, respectively.

**_UK Food Inflation_**

The UK grocery retail market experienced industry-wide price deflation from 2014 to 2016, with deflation
at -0.2% in 2014, -2.6% in 2015 and -2.4% in 2016, respectively, according to the OECD (measured by the
CPI). Low or no inflation or deflation, along with weakening customer demand and lower real wage growth,
contributed to discounters gaining a stronger foothold in the UK grocery retail market as they competed
through low prices and store openings to attract more price-conscious customers. These combined factors
resulted in downward pressure on our LFL sales growth from 2014 to 2016, as set forth in the following two
charts.

However, as food inflation in the United Kingdom has increased in more recent years, our LFL
performance has improved.

**UK Clothing and Footwear Retail Market**

The following chart below sets forth the development of the UK clothing and footwear retail market from
2007 to 2019 on a Retail Value RSP basis, including the breakdown between in-store and online sales,
according to Euromonitor.

(Source: Euromonitor: Retailing 2020 Edition. Note: The UK Clothing and Footwear Retail Market is referring to the sum of Apparel
and Footwear Specialist Retailers and Apparel and Footwear E-Commerce.)

In addition to the grocery retail market, we operate in the UK clothing and footwear retail market, which
includes the sale of all types of clothing, footwear and accessories, through the George Clothing brand.
According to Euromonitor, the UK clothing and footwear retail market was valued at £42.3 billion on a Retail
Value RSP basis in 2019. During the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the UK clothing and footwear retail
market declined as a result of rising unemployment, pressure on discretionary spending and weakened
customer confidence. Furthermore, the market experienced a period of price inflation between 2010 and
2012. Over the past five years, the UK clothing and footwear retail market has grown at a CAGR of 2.8%,
with much of the growth driven by online channels, which had a CAGR of 12.1% between 2014 and 2019
in comparison to a CAGR of only 0.1% for in-store channels, each on a Retail Value RSP basis, as stated
by Euromonitor. These results reflect an overall trend toward increased access to, and usage of, the internet
coupled with a greater propensity to buy online and growing usage of social media to influence and facilitate
clothing and footwear retail sales.

The UK clothing and footwear retail market experienced a significant downturn in the first half of 2020
due to COVID-19 related lockdowns and reduced consumer demand for non-essential purchases which
included clothing and footwear. During the first of such lockdowns which lasted from March 23, 2020 to
July 4, 2020, all non-essential retail stores including all clothing and footwear stores were ordered to close
by the UK government. Subsequently, the value of retail sales of clothing and footwear at current prices
(seasonally adjusted) decreased by 12.6% in the first quarter of 2020 and 54% in the second quarter of
2020 respectively as compared to the same period a year earlier, according to ONS. The third quarter of

-----

2020 saw a gradual recovery with an 17.8% decrease in the value of retail sales of clothing and footwear
at current prices (seasonally adjusted) compared to the same period a year earlier, according to ONS. As
a result of COVID-19 related lockdowns, the UK clothing and footwear retail market also experienced a
significant shift from in-store purchasing to online channels. However, in-store sales began to recover in
the third quarter of 2020 as lockdowns were eased. For a further discussion of ASDA's position in the
clothing market, specifically relating to the George Clothing brand, see "Business—Our Brands" and "Key
_Strengths—The George Clothing and George Home offers are profitable and well-established."_

**UK Homeware Retail Market**

The following chart sets forth the development of the UK homeware retail market from 2007 to 2019 on a
Retail Value RSP basis, including the breakdown between in-store and online sales.

(Source: Euromonitor: Retailing 2020 Edition. Note: The UK Homeware Retail Market is referring to the sum of Homewares and
Home Furnishing Stores and Homewares and Home Furnishing E-Commerce.)

We also operate in the UK homeware retail market, which includes the sale of all types of home furniture
and furnishings, homewares, floor coverings and soft furnishings through the George Home brand.
According to Euromonitor, the UK homeware retail market was valued at £12.8 billion on a Retail Value
RSP basis in 2019. Between 2007 and 2019, the UK homeware retail market experienced growth at a 0.3%
CAGR on a Retail Value RSP basis as stated by Euromonitor. In the past five years, the UK homeware
retail market has grown at a CAGR of 2.9%, with growth mainly driven by the online channel, which had a
CAGR of 9.5% between 2014 and 2019, each on a Retail Value RSP basis, as stated by Euromonitor.
While online sales continue to grow, traditional in-store formats remain important in the UK homeware and
home furnishing retail market as customers combine online research and purchasing with in-store visits as
part of their buying process. Between 2014 and 2019, the in-store segment experienced marginal growth
with Retail Value RSP of 1.1% over that period, according to Euromonitor.

Similar to the UK clothing and footwear market, the UK homeware market also experienced a significant
downturn in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-19 related lockdowns and reduced consumer demand for
non-essential purchases. During the initial COVID-19 lockdown which lasted from March 23, 2020 to July
4, 2020, all non-essential retail stores including all homeware stores were ordered to close by the UK
government. Subsequently, according to ONS, the value of retail sales of homeware at current prices
(seasonally adjusted) decreased by 11.3% in the first quarter of 2020 and 50.1% in the second quarter of
2020 respectively as compared to the same periods a year earlier. According to ONS, the UK homeware
market gradually rebounded in the third quarter of 2020 with a 5.3% increase in the value of retail sales of
homeware at current prices (seasonally adjusted) compared to the same period a year earlier as lockdown
restrictions eased. The increased time spent by consumers at home due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the
United Kingdom has led to higher demand for home office equipment and home improvement activities,
resulting in the gradual homeware market rebound in the third quarter of 2020. For a further discussion of
ASDA's position in the homeware market, specifically relating to the George Home brand, see "Business—
_Our Brands" and "Key Strengths—The George Clothing and George Home offers are profitable and well-_

**UK Grocery Retail Key Trends**

The UK grocery retail market has been undergoing a fundamental shift in recent years, driven by
changing customer lifestyles, technological changes, evolving competitive dynamics and socio-economic
factors. These trends have led to a shift towards discounters, convenience stores and online channels,
amongst other changes.

We believe there are five key trends that may shape the future of the UK grocery retail market: the
increased focus on value-based propositions and the growth of the discounters, the growth of the online
channel, the shift to convenience, the redefinition of service expectations and the increased demands for
social responsibility.

**_Increased focus on Value-Based Propositions and Growth of the Discounters_**

Since the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, customers have become increasingly price sensitive. Such
customers, however, still desire high-quality offerings. In response, discounters developed a range of valuebased propositions focused on delivering high quality at low prices, which appeal to this growing number
of UK shoppers who seek a good 'value'. These propositions have helped discounters to achieve a strong
presence in the UK grocery retail market. For example, discounters Aldi and Lidl have increased their
combined market share (on a Total Grocery Absolute Sales basis) from 3.7% in the calendar year 2007 to
12.1% in the calendar year 2019, according to Kantar and as reflected in the following chart.

(Source: Kantar.)

From 2013 to 2019, discounters gained considerable scale and market share as a result of new store
openings and continued price consciousness from customers. According to Euromonitor and relevant
public reporting, discounters' store count grew from approximately 1,118 in 2013 to approximately 1,664 in
2019, as set forth in the following chart.

(Source: Euromonitor: Retailing 2020 edition (with the exception of the 2019 numbers, which are taken from competitor public
disclosure).)

As discounters have increased their store counts, they have won market share from other market
players.

193


-----

According to Kantar, as of December 27, 2020, we had significant market share in the same geographic
areas where discounters already commanded a relatively high market share - the North of England,
Scotland and Wales - on a Total Grocery Absolute Sales basis. We believe that, as discounters seek to
increase their market share through expansion in new areas, they are likely to consider expanding into new
regional markets - particularly in London, South of England and East of England - where we have a lower
market share, a trend that we believe is supported by the information about market share by geography
set forth in the following chart. We also believe the majority of ASDA's stores have discounters in their
catchment area.

(Source: Kantar as of December 27, 2020.)

**_Growth of Online Channel_**

ASDA, along with Tesco, Sainsbury's, Morrisons and Waitrose, offer groceries and non-food items for
purchase and delivery online alongside "Click & Collect" services for purchases made through our
websites. Pure online players, such as Ocado and Amazon Fresh, also compete in the UK online grocery
market.

The strong growth of online grocery sales in the United Kingdom is supported by multiple drivers,
including:

  - Increasing population of tech-aware customers with a higher propensity to buy online;

  - Higher internet penetration (driven by increased usage of mobile and faster connections)
combined with an increasing propensity to use the internet to buy online;

  - Technological advances significantly improving the online proposition for customers (such as better
interfaces, mobile apps, convenient digital wallets and payment systems);

194


-----

  - Improving product offerings as technology improves and competition increases (for example,
greater availability of products online compared to in-store); and

  - Improving delivery options as density of deliveries improves (resulting in cheaper, faster deliveries
and improved availability of more predictable, flexible and diverse delivery timeslots).

Growth in online grocery has been accelerated by the onset of COVID-19 as customers have
increasingly prioritised factors such as social distancing and convenience and government restrictions have
encouraged customers to find ways to remain at home.

**_Shift to Convenience_**

Another significant customer trend shaping the UK grocery retail market is customers' increasing
prioritisation of convenience. As part of that, there is an increasing preference amongst customers for more
frequent but smaller shopping trips, with numerous top-ups through the course of the week at smaller, more
conveniently located stores. This trend can be partly explained by a preference for reduced food waste in
light of growing environmental concerns, smaller households, less pre-planned lifestyles and a growing
preference in general for convenience. This trend has also been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic
as shoppers increasingly seek conveniently located stores in order to avoid longer travel for health and
safety reasons and comply with government restrictions put in place since the outbreak of the pandemic.

**_Redefined Service Expectations_**

Increasing digitalisation and evolving customer dynamics have shaped an increasingly fast-paced
market. Customers are now seeking a transparent and frictionless experience to improve and expedite
their grocery retail experience. This is reflected in the increased usage of self-checkout, "Scan & Go," "Click
& Collect" and online services as customers opt to use these facilities to tailor and improve their shopping
experiences. In line with the growing desire for convenience and efficient shopping experiences, there is
increasing demand for combined and differentiated service offerings in the grocery retail market, which
allow customers to fulfil multiple needs in one convenient location such as parcel collection and drop-off,
pharmacy services and selections of household items, all in addition to traditional grocery retail offerings.
Grocery retailers, like ourselves, have responded with increased service offerings such as "toyou," which
takes advantage of customers' growing online shopping habits to create a service that allows customers to
return or collect online purchases while on a regular trip to a brick-and-mortar grocery retailer.

**_Increased Demand for Social Responsibility_**

Dedication to social responsibility is increasingly relevant to customers, particularly for Gen Z and
Millennial customers, and a commitment to social responsibility has become a necessary factor if retailers
want to meet customers' expectations. There is a growing share of customers who have concerns about
animal welfare, environmental sustainability and ethical sourcing, and who view their purchasing decision
as a lifestyle statement. In line with these concerns, customers are increasingly demanding traceability and
information about production methods, driving the popularity of fair trade and organic products that can
meet these needs. In response, retailers are adapting their business models in order to meet customers'
demand.

**BUSINESS**

**OVERVIEW**

We are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom and the second-largest grocery retailer
in the North of England, Scotland and Wales (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a
52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). We operate a significant store estate of 614
stores (excluding standalone PFSs) that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom. We
also have the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery
Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). The graph below
compares our total grocery market share with that of other major UK grocery retailers.

(Source: Kantar. Based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020. *Ocado Market share
shown.)

We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by
favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household
expenditure on food and beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through
economic fluctuations. Groceries are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe
generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail
markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in
recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic. See also
"Industry."

One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is
in turn centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to "Every
Day Low Price" and our wholly-owned supplier, IPL, which enables us to take a vertically-integrated
approach to procurement and which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other
key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and well-established George Clothing and
George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers and our team of flexible and engaged
colleagues. Historically, we have benefited from the support of Walmart, our former parent company. We
will continue to receive support from Walmart over the next three years pursuant to the Transitional
Agreements negotiated in connection with the Acquisition. For more information about the ongoing support
to be provided by Walmart, please see "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—
_Transitional Agreements with Walmart" and "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are_
_risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart."_

We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended
December 31, 2019, our revenue was approximately £22.9 billion (including petrol), of which approximately
£2 billion was online sales, and our Adjusted EBITDA was approximately £1.2 billion (including petrol).

online (including George.com)).

(Source: ASDA information. Year ended December 31, 2019. Note: Does not include £61 million of other revenue.)
Our differentiated operating model has resulted in strong financial performance: our successful financial
profile is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA
less capital expenditure) and cash conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA)
in recent years. In 2018 and 2019, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.5% (including petrol), our
cumulative free cash flow was approximately £1.7 billion and our average cash conversion was
approximately 70%. The charts below show our EBITDA Margins, Adjusted EBITDA Margins, Unadjusted
Cash Conversion ("Unadjusted Cash Conversion" is calculated as Unadjusted Free Cash Flow divided
by EBITDA) and Unadjusted Free Cash Flow ("Unadjusted Free Cash Flow" is calculated as EBITDA
less capital expenditure) for the years ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2019 and our cash
conversion and free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019.

We believe that our business, operating model and financial performance also benefit from our
significant freehold real estate asset portfolio. See "Brokers' Opinions of Pricing."

We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we
maintain a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom. Within
the UK value market, we have strong market shares across ambient products (13.0%), fresh/chilled
(11.6%) and total grocery (12.2%) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52
weeks ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). Our offer is strong across the full food basket: our
category market shares range from 12% to 14% (except household and toiletries) (in each case in terms of
Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). We
believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to
internal ASDA data, our prices are approximately 6% to 7.5% less expensive than our traditional grocer
competitors (on a 2020 year-to-date (weeks 1-42) average, based on total goods price gap percentage).

Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is
supplemented by a large clothing and general merchandise business. We offer our entire range of food
and non-food products to customers as a convenient "one-stop shop" experience that is supported and
enhanced by our strong online offer. We believe our omni-channel offer, through which we reach customers
at our brick-and-mortar stores, through our significant online offering and on our app, appeals to our
customers. In 2020, there were approximately 9.8 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with
approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days
ended February 28, 2020), and approximately 723,000 weekly orders post COVID-19 (based on the
average orders for the seven days ended September 30, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has increased
use of and engagement with our online platforms and we currently fulfil approximately 720,000 online orders
per week. Our online grocery business operates from 350 stores, we offer at-home delivery and customers
are also able to collect their purchases at one of approximately 460 ASDA Click & Collect sites. We are
also expanding our 1-hour Click & Collect offer. Our business model integrates our store-based and online
offer by leveraging our stores to fulfil online orders.

Our online grocery business is profitable and has been consistently gaining market share within one of
the world's most developed online grocery markets. We have consistently outperformed the UK online
grocery market and increased our online market share in the last three years. According to Kantar, we
currently operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, holding 18.2% of
market share (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) as of December 2019, which
grew to 19.8% as of December 27, 2020 (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales),
representing a 1.5% gain and the second-strongest share gain since December 2019 amongst our key
competitors. The chart below shows the evolution of our market share as compared with our key
competitors for the periods presented. See also "Industry."

2020 as compared to the 52-week periods through December 31 for 2017, 2018 and 2019.)

Our online business is already of significant scale: the chart below shows the growth of our online sales,
including a breakdown of online grocery versus George.com sales, for the periods presented.

(Source: ASDA information.)

According to Kantar, we are the second-largest online clothing retailer overall by volume in the United
Kingdom and we held 6.0% of the total UK online clothing (excluding essentials, footwear and accessories)
market by volume for the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020. Combined sales for our online grocery
business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion (of which £1.5
billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £1.9 billion in 2019 (of
which £1.6 billion were online grocery sales and £0.3 billion were George.com sales) to a total of £2.7
billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 (of which £2.4 billion were online grocery sales and
£0.3 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR of 26% between 2018 and September 30, 2020.
Additionally, our toyou service allows customers to conveniently collect and return orders from George.com
and other partner retailers at our stores. We have partnered with 119 brands and process more than 10
million parcels per year.

With our team of approximately 140,000 flexible and engaged colleagues serving approximately 15
million customers each week (based on the average of weeks 39 to 42 of 2020), we are committed to and
deeply invested in the UK food supply chain.

Our business model is supported by diversification. First, we are a mass market retailer that serves the
entire UK population, in terms of both customer demographics and geography, with our customer base
skewing slightly towards value-seeking families, younger shoppers and lower-income customers who are

attracted by our Every Day Low Price strategy and with strong market shares in the North of England,
Scotland and Wales. For more information about our customer mix, see "—Our Customers," and for more
information about the geographic distribution of our stores, see "—Our Real Estate Portfolio." Second, we
believe we are well-positioned geographically, with a strong regional footprint across the United Kingdom.
Our store footprint is strongest in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Our large and diverse store
estate offers customers a variety of differentiated shopping formats. We operate 30 supercentres, 396
superstores, 155 supermarkets and 33 ASDA Living stores. For more information on our stores, see "—
_Our Store Formats."_

Subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, our 18 standalone PFSs and 305 co-located PFSs (including
both their underlying real estate assets and their business operations) will be sold to EG Group pursuant
to the Forecourt Business Disposal. However, to the extent we are required to do so in order to obtain
regulatory approval for the Acquisition, we will sell all or part of our forecourt business to third parties. In
addition, we will transfer to Propco 2 (or an affiliate) the real estate relating to the Warehouse Assets, and
to the extent required pursuant to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, the Select Retail Assets
and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets promptly following the CMA Clearance Date. We
will continue to operate the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the
Substitute Retail Assets pursuant to the ASDA Leases which will be put in place in accordance with the
terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. For more information, see "The Transactions—The
_Post Completion Disposals." This "Business" section, including historical statements herein, principally_
relates the ASDA's business as it will be following the completion of the Transactions.

Following the completion of the Acquisition, we will continue to benefit over the next three years from
support provided by Walmart, the world's largest retailer, through the Transitional Agreements. See
"Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart" and "Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA_
_from Walmart." In addition to the Transitional Agreements, we have also agreed with Walmart to set up_
separation planning working groups to ensure a smooth transition. Our ongoing relationship with Walmart
is expected to bring a number of benefits, in particular:

## • Information and technology support to facilitate the change from the Walmart ecosystem;

 • Deep research and development expertise and capabilities;

 • Global sourcing, leveraging Walmart's sourcing capabilities in clothing and general merchandise;

 • Best practices, leveraging Walmart's expertise and experience as a leading global retailer; and

 • Long-term support and continued partnership with Walmart's management and leadership.

**HISTORY**

Headquartered in Leeds, we are an omni-channel retailer across England, Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. We have built our business on listening to our diverse range of customers, offering what
they need at the best value and bringing innovation to the UK market.

We were founded in 1965 through the merger of the Asquith family grocery business with the Associated
Dairies company in Yorkshire. Our name is derived from this historic merger, combining "Asquith" and
"Dairies" to form "ASDA."

Founded in the North of England, we have a rich history, heritage and culture. The Asquith family has
deep ties to the grocery business, W.R. Asquith having run a butchers shop in Knottingly, West Yorkshire,
which eventually expanded to seven shops. W.R. Asquith's sons, Peter and Fred, went on to create the
United Kingdom's first self-service supermarket in Castleford, introducing food discounting to the UK
grocery market, and eventually co-founded ASDA. In parallel to the growth of the Asquith family business,
a group of West Riding dairy farmers joined forces, eventually becoming Associated Dairies & Farm Stores
Limited led by Arthur Stockdale. Arthur's son, Sir Noel Stockdale, went on to co-found ASDA with Peter
and Fred Asquith.

In 1965, we acquired GEM, a major U.S. discount retailer operating in the United Kingdom. With the
addition of general merchandise to the former GEM stores, we introduced the superstore to the UK market,
a landmark event in the development of UK retailing. To complement this offer, Peter Asquith also
introduced the first discounted petrol filling station.

By 1970, we operated over 30 stores and were poised to expand beyond our original home in the North
of England. Throughout the 1970s, we grew our presence in the South of England, opening stores in
Newport, Plymouth and Gosport. In 1977, we launched our "ASDA Price" TV adverts, featuring the "pocket

200


-----

tap" which came to be the official sign language for ASDA. By the end of the 1970s, we were operating
over 80 stores and opened our 100th store in 1981.

Throughout the 1980s, we focused on expanding our distribution capabilities, opening seven new
distribution centres strategically located throughout the United Kingdom by 1985. In 1987, our flagship
Watford store opened, another landmark in UK retailing, and featured the longest-ever checkout bank at
the time, with 45 checkouts. In 1988, we opened our headquarters in Leeds, with Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher overseeing the opening ceremonies. In 1989, George Davies was asked to produce a line of
clothing for us that was high-quality, high-value and had its own identity: the pioneering George brand was
born.

In the 1990s, we developed the ASDA Way of Working, an innovative framework for a new
organisational structure that focuses on our stores and promotes colleague involvement, which set the
stage for the ASDA culture of today. In 1996, we opened our first ASDA Pharmacy location in Harrogate,
North Yorkshire and launched our "Tickled Pink" campaign to raise money for the fight against breast
cancer, a partnership that continues to this day. In 1998, we began our online retail operations with a
dedicated depot in Croydon.

In 1999, we joined the Walmart family, becoming part of the world's largest retailer. Throughout the
early 2000s, we continued to grow and innovate, expanding our online and Click & Collect offers, opening
our first ASDA Living store and our first Eco Store, winning awards for the value we offer customers as well
as for the positive environment we create for colleagues, launching our Free From and Extra Special offers,
launching standalone PFSs as well as ASDA Opticians. In 2015, we celebrated our 50th birthday and
George's 25th birthday. In 2016, Roger Burnley joined our team as Chief Operating Officer and Deputy
Chief Executive and was promoted in 2018 to President and CEO. ASDA has continued to roll out
innovations, including the United Kingdom's first parcel tower, which allows customers to collect online
orders in less than 60 seconds, and voice-activated shopping through Google Home.

Our values are rooted in service to our customers, respect for the individual, striving for excellence and
acting with integrity. We pursue our values with the support of our colleagues, culture and technology.

**KEY STRENGTHS**

We believe that we benefit from the following strengths, including being a business of significant scale
with a history of resilient performance, a differentiated operating model, a successful financial profile and
a significant asset backing, as further described below.

**_We are a business of significant scale with a history of resilient performance_**

_We operate in a large, historically stable, resilient and growing industry with favourable macroeconomic_
_tailwinds_

We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market, which has demonstrated
resilient performance underpinned by favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population,
consumer confidence and household spend on food and beverages. Since the 2007-2009 global financial
crisis, UK GDP growth has shown stable development: annual GDP growth has ranged between 1.3% and
2.9% between 2010 and 2019, according to ONS. In 2020, GDP growth in the United Kingdom is expected
to reflect a sharp decline due to the impact of COVID-19. However, it is predicted by ONS to quickly recover
to growth of approximately 5.5% in 2021 and, post-2021, UK GDP growth is expected to stabilise to an
average of 1.9% in subsequent years through 2025. The UK grocery retail market is also characterised by
favourable demographic characteristics, including a growing population. According to ONS, the UK
population is projected to grow from 67 million in 2019 to 70 million by 2031, which is expected to result in
an overall increase in the consumer base for groceries.

In addition to its historical stability, the UK grocery retail market is also resilient. Groceries are a
necessary and stable consumer expenditure, which generally allows the grocery retail market to weather
economic downturns better than certain other retail markets that involve more discretionary spending. For
example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history
during and following the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The UK
grocery retail market peaked at 6.2% year-over-year growth in 2011, with a CAGR of 5.1% between 2007
and 2011, in each case according to Euromonitor. Additionally, during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis,
according to ONS, the percentage of average weekly household spend on food and non-alcoholic drinks
remained fairly consistent at approximately 11.0%, demonstrating the market's resilience during periods of
macroeconomic difficulty. According to ONS, this percentage has remained relatively flat following the
2007-2009 global financial crisis and the 2011 sovereign debt crisis, averaging 10.6% between 2012 and
2019, which we believe underscores the largely non-discretionary nature of grocery purchases. According
to Kantar, the UK grocery market's year-over-year growth increased to 12.3% (on a Total Grocery Absolute

201


-----

Sales basis for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020), although growth in 2020 has been principally
driven by the impact of COVID-19 (mainly consisting of an increase in the consumption of food and drink
products at home during lockdowns), rather than long-term underlying growth drivers.

_We are the United Kingdom's third-largest grocer, holding sizeable market share_

According to Kantar, we are the third-largest grocery retailer in the United Kingdom, with 12.2% of
market share and the second-largest grocery retailer in the North of England, Scotland and Wales (based
on Total Grocery Absolute Sales over 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020), with revenue of approximately
£19.6 billion and £20.0 billion (excluding petrol) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the 12 months
ended September 30, 2020, respectively. We have a network of 614 stores (excluding standalone PFSs)
throughout the United Kingdom, with a particular focus on superstores, supermarket and online formats.
We are also the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom by value (in terms of Total
Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar) and have been
growing faster than our competitors except for Sainsbury's in this channel, having increased our market
share over many years and particularly throughout 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we
believe that we are well-positioned as a large and established business with a clear set of peers.

We also believe that our multi-format, omni-channel offer positions us well to compete effectively and
to continue growing our market share. Despite not operating convenience formats, our Adjusted EBITDA
in the year ended December 31, 2019 was £1.2 billion (including petrol), which we believe indicates that
we have headroom for growth in the convenience market. We also cater to a broad target demographic,
which we believe provides us a long-term competitive advantage. In contrast to discounters, we provide a
broad range of branded as well as own-brand offers, while also having a more developed and established
online platform.

**_We believe we have faced the greatest impacts of discounters on our market_**

The adverse impact of discounters (primarily Aldi and Lidl) on the traditional grocers in recent years has
been significant but, while we believe that discounters will continue to put pressure on the market, we
believe that we have already faced the greatest impacts of this competition in the markets in which we
operate and that the discounters pose a greater challenge to other traditional grocers, who we believe are
more geographically exposed to the areas where discounters are likely to focus in the near-term.

As compared to our traditional grocer peers, our geographical concentration in the North of England,
Scotland and Wales, as evidenced by our number two market shares in those regions. The discounters
have already penetrated these areas and we expect the discounters to shift the focus of their expansion to
the South of England, the East of England and London, where we operate fewer sites as compared to the
Midlands, the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Furthermore, the catchment areas of 76% of our
stores already contain both major discounters, Aldi and Lidl, which is a higher percentage than any of our
traditional grocer competitors (the boundary used is a 10-minute drive-time radius around each point, which
is consistent regardless of location type or size of store and stores are only included in the count where
there is both Aldi and Lidl stores present within the drive-time boundary). Therefore, we believe that our
current performance already factors in the adverse impact of discounters to a large extent.

**_We have demonstrated resilience through downturns_**

Just as our market has proven resilient in times of economic difficulty and uncertainty, our business has
also proven resilient during recent economic and market downturns, including during the 2007-2009 global
financial crisis, as well as through a more recent period of low food inflation in the United Kingdom and the
rise of discounters in the UK grocery retail market in more recent years, particularly during 2014 to 2016.
During the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, we continued to perform well, achieving an average like-forlike sales (excluding petrol) growth rate of 6.1% for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2008 and 2009.
Our EBITDA margins have also remained stable, ranging from 5.1% to 6.6% between 2007 and 2019.
During this same period, we also experienced stable revenue growth, at a CAGR of 2.5%.

**_We have performed well and have benefitted from an improved reputation through COVID-19_**

Despite the significant social and economic shifts driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, our business has
experienced strong overall performance, particularly in our online and supermarket formats. While large
stores did not perform as well as smaller formats during the first UK lockdown, they have remained
instrumental in supporting the growth of our online retail grocery business, with online grocery orders being
largely fulfilled from our stores. We also believe that the "one-stop stop" offer of our stores appeals to
customers seeking to leave their homes and fulfil multiple missions efficiently. Overall, our food business
has performed relatively consistently throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, despite an initial increase in
sales due to panic buying and customers stocking-up on key staples at the outset of each of the first three
lockdown periods. Following an initial decline at the beginning of the first lockdown, our general

202


-----

merchandise business has also generally performed well throughout these lockdown periods, due to
increasing purchases of homeware products. While our clothing business was initially negatively impacted
during the early stage of the first UK lockdown period, we have recently experienced improved performance
in this business in line with an overall improvement of the general economy and a rebound in consumer
confidence. Finally, we have also taken steps throughout the COVID-19 pandemic to enhance our
reputation with our stakeholders through various initiatives, including meal donations, priority delivery
services to care homes and additional leave provided to staff affected by COVID-19, which we believe have
had an overall positive impact on perceptions of our brand and business.

**_We benefit from a differentiated operating model_**

_We operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, which is profitable and_
_winning market share_

The United Kingdom has one of the most developed online grocery retail markets in the world, with one
of the highest rates of the population using the internet. There has been a significant shift in the grocery
retail market away from brick-and-mortar stores to online purchasing as demographic trends, greater
mobile and device usage, improved service proposition and technological advances in applications and
customer interfaces have driven increasing penetration rates in the online grocery retail market. We believe
we are poised to take advantage of these favourable consumer trends, as we have already established
ourselves in the rapidly growing UK online grocery retail market and our store and warehouse footprint is
strategically positioned across attractive geographic areas to service the growing demand for groceries
online.

According to Kantar, we are the second-largest online grocery retail platform in the United Kingdom,
holding 19.8% of market share (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) for the 52-week period ended
December 27, 2020. Relative to our competitors, we have posted the second-strongest share gain since
December 2019 and through the COVID-19 pandemic, with an industry-leading 3.3% increase in our share
of the online grocery retail market between December 2017 and December 2020 and an increase of 154
basis points between December 2019 and December 2020, according to Kantar (based on Total Grocery
Absolute Sales for the 52-week periods through December 31 for 2017, 2018 and 2019 and the 52-week
period ended December 27, 2020).

As a result of our significant gain in online market share, our online sales, combined sales for our online
grocery business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion (of
which £1.5 billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £1.9 billion
in 2019 (of which £1.6 billion were online grocery sales and £0.3 billion were George.com sales) to a total
of £2.7 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 (of which £2.4 billion were online grocery sales
and £0.3 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR of 26% between 2018 and September 30,
2020.

We believe there is greater scope for our online profitability to improve further. We expect that the
demand for online groceries will continue to be strong as customers increasingly adopt online shopping as
a more permanent and preferred way to purchase groceries following the initial lockdowns.

_We benefit from vertically integrated procurement through IPL_

We believe that we have a competitive advantage in food sourcing via our captive sourcing arm, IPL,
which enables us to take a vertically integrated approach to procurement. We believe that IPL provides us
with valuable sourcing differentiation as compared to our competitors. IPL is the largest importer of produce
in the United Kingdom and, while IPL is a group company, it is also our largest supplier. The aim of our
vertically integrated procurement model is to consolidate import activity for key products and reduce our
overall costs. In 2019, we purchased £1.5 billion of our products through IPL. The foundation of IPL's costprice advantage is that it eliminates the "middle man" who typically serves as the intermediary in the supply
chain, thereby giving us greater control of costs, quality and supply of a diverse range of products. We
have an extensive IPL footprint across the United Kingdom, with ten processing facilities across the country
and more than 4,200 colleagues. Our IPL product mix is diversified according to our needs, with a mix of
61% in produce, 27% in protein, 9% in beverages and 3% in grocery in 2019. Additionally, we have been
able to build upon and benefit from our supplier relationships to deliver supply chain continuity and make
progress in our sustainability agenda. We also believe that IPL will provide greater stability and allow us
greater control over our supply chain now that the United Kingdom has left the European Union's single
market and customs union.

_The George Clothing and George Home offers are profitable and well-established_

We launched our clothing offer, George, in 1990 and it is the second-largest clothing brand in the United
Kingdom by volume of units sold (excluding essentials, footwear and accessories) for the 52 weeks ended
December 13, 2020 and is the leading UK childrenswear brand with 21% market share by volume of units
sold as of December 13, 2020, in each case according to Kantar. Despite challenges to this product
category overall, our online clothing sales have increased from £104.3 million for the year to December 31,
2016 to £308.6 million for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, with more than two-thirds of all sales
now made via mobile devices. We believe this demonstrates our strength in the online segment, which is
a key part of our operating model. Additionally, we have expanded the George branded offer to include
general merchandise. The George Home brand generated approximately £530 million in sales and
contributed approximately 38% of our total general merchandising sales for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2019. Sales by the George Home brand grew at a CAGR of approximately 3% between the years
ended December 31, 2016 and 2019. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product
categories generally have higher margins than our food product categories.

_We have well-developed own-brands_

We believe that our own-brand offers have been a key strength of our business and continue to offer
growth opportunities. We have an extensive own-brand product range in our food business, with
approximately 7,000 own-brand SKUs, while our premium "Extra Special" offer is our fastest growing ownbrand product line. Our award-winning approach to range development and innovation enables us to meet
changing customer needs: we launched approximately 850 new lines in 2020 and approximately 2,500
lines having been reformulated in 2020. In addition to our diverse and extensive product offer with our ownbrand range, we have also been able to drive growth through service and price positioning. We leverage
our IPL sourcing model to deliver value, especially in our produce, cooked meats and wine segments.

_We are driven by our commitment to Every Day Low Prices_

We believe our commitment to Every Day Low Prices is a significant competitive advantage as we aim
to lead on price while staying competitive on assortment. We believe that we are the least-expensive fullselection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal ASDA data, our prices are
approximately 6% to 7.5% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on a 2020 year-to-date
(weeks 1-42) average, based on total goods price gap percentage). Our low prices are supported by
rigorous cost control and a commitment to Every Day Low Prices, which enables us to control expenses
so that we can pass cost savings on to our customers.

**_We have achieved a successful financial profile_**

We have achieved a successful financial profile that is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA
margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure) and cash conversion
(defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. In 2018 and 2019, our average
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.5% (including petrol), our cumulative free cash flow was approximately
£1.7 billion and our average cash conversion was approximately 70%. This strong financial performance
is driven by our Every Day Low Price model, diverse product offer, strong own-brand grocery offer and
well-established George-branded product categories. Our Adjusted EBITDA margins have benefitted from
our cost transformation programmes, which have generated SG&A cost savings without compromising the
low prices we offer our customers. Our active working capital management has resulted in approximately
£400 million of improvements over the past three years. Furthermore, we have pursued a disciplined
approach to our capital expenditure over time, with the aim of maintaining and improving our real estate
platform. Our well-invested store real estate portfolio underpins our strong, ongoing cash flow generation.

**_We are supported by a significant asset portfolio_**

We are supported by a well-invested and geographically diversified store estate, with 71% of our retail
sites being freehold (calculated as gross square footage of freehold stores as a percentage of gross square
footage of total stores, as of December 20, 2020; freehold percentage also includes certain properties that
are freehold with a partial leasehold or which are leasehold properties for which the leases have been
classed as long leasehold for the purposes of this calculation as those leases have nil or a peppercorn
ground rent). Subject to the facts, assumptions and qualifications set out in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing
and summarised in "Brokers' Opinions of Pricing." We believe we currently have a greater freehold
percentage than all but one of our traditional grocery competitors.

As shown in the charts below, our business is also unencumbered by significant unfunded pension
liabilities, following the bulk annuity insurance buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme, with no further
contributions anticipated. We do not anticipate significant future pension contributions and this will help us
to continue delivering quality cash conversion.

(Source: ASDA information.)

**BUSINESS STRATEGY**

Our primary strategy is designed to "win on price" by narrowing our price gap with discounters (such as
Aldi and Lidl) while providing good value and maintaining our price leadership position against our
traditional grocery peers, which we expect to further enhance customer loyalty. We aim to provide a
consistent, trusted experience, incentivising customers not to shop elsewhere, through the creation of
attractive store propositions and partnerships that increase our appeal to customers. We serve our
customers with our team of flexible and engaged colleagues, while increasing the number of self-serve
opportunities and transforming the in-store experience. We focus our growth where customers care,
expanding our addressable markets in online grocery, wholesale and community convenience.

**_Winning on price with value equivalent to the discounters_**

We are already well established as the lowest-price full-selection retailer in the United Kingdom and we
comfortably lead the traditional grocers in terms of lowest price. Moving forward, we intend to narrow our
price gap to the discounters and further expand our existing price gap with other traditional grocers. We
aim to achieve this by simplifying our core customer proposition to offer a curated range in food, general
merchandise and clothing that responds to customers' demonstrated willingness to shop a tighter range of
offers in-store. We will also create a more hassle-free customer experience in-store with our digital
transformation. For example, we intend to implement more customer self-serve options, such as moving to
a checkout model which features 80/20 self-checkout solutions and we plan to optimise our in-store
fulfilment operations. We believe this will enable us to deliver a simplified operating model and end-to-end
supply chain efficiencies to drive further investment in value for the customer at the shelf edge, driving
greater traffic and therefore sales growth, which will in turn stimulate greater volume, thereby creating a
positive effect for our overall business.

We are assessing our approach to further reward customer loyalty by exploring non-traditional and
digitally-based loyalty mechanisms so that we can identify more customers in more transactions. We
believe that this approach will allow us to grow our customer analytics platform to bring better, faster, and
deeper customer insights to our largest investment decisions and to improve the overall customer
experience by personalising our offer.

**_Develop ASDA as a platform by forming relevant partnerships_**

We aim to grow ASDA as a platform through simplification of the store proposition by forming
partnerships that enable us to provide a broader set of relevant branded products and services, while also
building upon our existing capabilities, such as logistics and our customer-facing toyou proposition. We
believe adding partners to our platform will result in the creation of appealing "one-stop-shop" store
destinations for more customer missions. We are attracting relevant partners with our existing customer
base and scale, particularly with respect to the George brand clothing and general merchandise offers. For
example, our own-brand general merchandise proposition, led by the George Home brand, will become
more omni-channel focused as we grow those categories in which we believe we already have a strong
position and can maintain or gain leading market share. Meanwhile, in other categories, we will extend
product ranges with partners who specialise in those categories, have a strong affinity fit with our existing
customers and bring complementary expertise and reputation, such as in toys with The Entertainer. We
believe these partnerships will not only provide additional income through rent and revenue share models,
but will also create a positive effect on our overall business.

**_Growth where customers care, expanding our addressable market_**

We have grown our online grocery channel ahead of the market in 2020, having achieved 80% yearover-year growth as compared to the 66% year-over-year growth (in terms of value) achieved by the overall
UK online grocery market, according to Kantar (based on the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020).
However, we believe there is further headroom for growth based on continued channel shifting, demand
and customer "stickiness." We plan to continue to drive growth and market share gains in the online channel
through the acceleration of our online grocery channel's capacity to meet increased demand. We continue
to seek to optimise our online grocery operating model and further develop our already profitable economic
model through the ongoing assessment of our online product range and promotions, further monetisation
of our e-commerce assets, as well as other initiatives.

In addition to growing our core online grocery business, we are targeting further growth by expanding
the reach of our online platform and expanding our delivery services. We expect to provide customers with
greater and more convenient access to our product range by accelerating our last-mile delivery capabilities
via partnerships: for example, we have recently expanded our partnership with UberEats to over 100 of our
stores, with a further 100 planned in early 2021.

We believe that customers seeing ASDA in new locations and new formats will help us broaden our
customer base, thereby benefitting our core proposition (which is composed of our in-store and online food
and non-food offerings, and does not include trials, such as the ASDA On the Move wholesale-convenience
concept). We also believe that we can further expand our addressable market by accessing wholesale and
community convenience channels in an asset-light manner. We are looking to extend the reach of our
products delivered through wholesale and more specifically through partnerships that would provide
wholesale delivery services by using the logistics and distribution capabilities of IPL. We aim to broaden
our reach to existing and new customers through further convenience channel trials, using our established
partnerships to access the convenience channel within local communities. For example, ASDA On the
Move is our first entrance into the convenience market, where we are carrying out an initial trial with the
EG Group at three store locations in Ashby, Leamore and Primley. ASDA On the Move is a wholesale
arrangement whereby ASDA's own brand products as well as branded products will be sold in third-partyowned smaller convenience store formats.

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

**COVID-19 Update**

Structural shifts due to COVID-19 have led to increased overall growth in the grocery retail market.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, customer behaviour has changed, with a shift away from out-of-home
food consumption towards at-home food consumption, to the benefit of the UK grocery market. The chart
below shows COVID-19-accelerated channel shifts over the periods presented. For further information on
prevailing trends in the UK grocery retail market and, in particular, the recent channel shifts which have
been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, please see "Industry."

(Source: Kantar Worldpanel, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a year-to-date basis ended December 27, 2020.)

Grocery sales have grown by 12.3% between December 1, 2019 and December 27, 2020, according
to Kantar, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales. Changes to consumer behaviour that have positively
benefitted the grocery market during the COVID-19 pandemic include: increased consumption of food at
home, a shift to online shopping channels, increased preference for shopping locally, in particular during
the first UK lockdown (which we believe benefitted retail groups with a strong convenience store presence),
and an increased focus on food safety, hygiene and health.

Despite significant challenges posed by COVID-19, our business has remained resilient, supported by
a well-developed online channel, which saw significant growth during government-imposed lockdowns as
customer behaviour evolved. We were able to quickly increase the capacity of our online offer in response
to increased demand driven by the pandemic, gaining market share and improving the profitability of our
online business.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have benefitted from healthy revenue growth driven by higher food
sales volumes (which were in turn driven by stockpiling and increased customer demand for in-home
groceries via the online grocery channel), while margins contracted due to adverse changes in sales and
product mix resulting from decreases in clothing sales, which impacted the George Clothing brand, the
temporary closure of 33 ASDA Living stores and the shift in product mix within the food category away from
higher-margin categories, such as food-to-go, and towards lower-margin categories, such as beer, wine
and spirits and meat, which factors were partially offset by lower levels of promotional activity and stronger
general merchandise sales. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product categories
generally have higher margins than our food product categories. Profitability was also adversely impacted
by COVID-19-related increases in operating costs, such as the increase in retail colleague wage costs
(driven by bonus payments, overtime wages and wages paid colleagues absent from work due to COVID19, as well as wages paid to colleagues who worked during such sick colleagues' absences, rather than
as a result of increased wage rates), increased costs incurred in connection with goodwill compensation
paid to clothing suppliers, holiday markdowns, enhanced cleaning and related health and safety measures,
as well as higher retail operating expenditures.

We have considered the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event: the

207


-----

impact on future results and cash flows is difficult to estimate and we have therefore considered a range of
scenarios as described in note 1 ("Accounting Policies") of the 2019 Financial Statements. See "Risk
_Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—The_
_impact of COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to create_
_uncertainty in our market and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations_
_for the foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control."_

We took significant steps during the first twelve weeks of the first lockdown period in the spring of 2020
to protect our most vulnerable colleagues, asking them to remain home on contracted pay in order to
ensure their safety, while we increased social-distancing and protective measures at our stores. When we
welcomed these colleagues back, we carried out individual risk assessments and conducted socialdistancing training for them. In September 2020, we further tightened our safety measures across our
stores to provide an enhanced level of protection to our customers and colleagues, introducing new door
marshals at the front of stores and increasing security presence in the aisles of larger stores; marshals also
provide sanitised baskets to customers as they enter stores. Colleagues continue to be on hand to help
customers with safety queries and reiterate government guidelines to wear a face covering and maintain
social distancing while they shop. Customers who do not have a face covering when they enter the store
are offered a pack of disposable masks that they can pay for as they complete their shopping. Additional
hand sanitisation stations are in place in the busiest sections of all stores in addition to the multiple cleaning
points already found throughout stores.

Should current safety guidelines continue, we believe that it is unlikely that we will continue to incur a
significant portion of the additional costs in the future that we incurred in responding to the COVID-19
pandemic during the first two lockdowns, as many of these costs incurred were one-off in nature. The chart
below shows the COVID-19 impacts for ASDA on a year-to-date basis as of September 30,
2020.

(1) "GNFR" refers to goods not for resale.

(Source: ASDA information.)

In March 2020, as part of a number of measures to support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic,
the UK government, the Scottish government and the devolved administrations for Wales and Northern
Ireland announced full relief for rates charges applicable to certain eligible commercial properties for the
rates year beginning in April 2020 (and in the case of Northern Ireland, such support ended after July 2020).
This relief applied to a number of properties owned or leased by the Group and as such, no rates charge
has been recognised in these accounts for the period to which this relief applied. On December 3, 2020,
we publicly announced that we would voluntarily pay business rates for the April 2020/21 year on the
properties to which the relief applied. As rates relief was in place at September 30, 2020, no liability existed
at that date and as such, our directors have concluded that the announcement on December 3, 2020 is a
non-adjusting post-balance sheet event per the guidance set out in IAS 10. Discussions with the relevant
local authorities relating to the timing of payment are ongoing.

**OUR BUSINESSES**

We are an omni-channel retailer centred around a brick-and-mortar store network, which is
geographically diversified across the United Kingdom, and our websites (primarily through
groceries.asda.com and George.com). Our retail business comprises a food (which in turn comprises
produce, ambient products and fresh food products) and a non-food offer (which in turn comprises clothing,
homeware and general merchandise offers). We also offer our customers other services, including, among
other things, a mobile phone service, various financial products, parcel drop and collection and in-store
pharmacies and opticians.

**Our Retail Business**

Our retail business comprises a food segment, which consists of our grocery business, and a non-food
segment, which includes our well-known George Clothing and George Home brands, as well as a general
merchandise and health and wellness offer. We offer over 90 product groups for sale across 22 categories
(excluding petrol).

We operate our retail business through both brick-and-mortar retail sites and through online sales made,
primarily, via groceries.asda.com and George.com.

Our physical retail business operates under four distinct formats: supercentres and superstores,
supermarkets, ASDA Living and PFSs. We also recently entered the convenience market, with the launch
our ASDA On the Move wholesale-convenience concept. The concept is being trialled by EG Group at
three of their sites and is based around a wholesale approach. Our standalone PFSs and co-located PFSs
will be sold to EG Group pursuant to the Forecourt Business Disposal, or to the extent we are required to
do so to obtain regulatory approval for the Acquisition, we will sell all or part of our forecourt business to
third parties. For more information on our store formats, see "—Our Store Formats" and for more
information on how the Transactions will impact our PFS business, see "The Transactions."

We aim to develop ASDA as a platform by forming partnerships that enable us to provide a broader set
of relevant branded products and services while also building on our existing capabilities such as logistics
and the customer-facing toyou proposition. We believe adding partners to our platform will result in the
creation of attractive store destinations, in which more customer missions can be accomplished under one
roof. See "—Business Strategies."

Food

In 2019, our food segment accounted for 85% (£16.6 billion) of our total sales of £19.6 billion (excluding
petrol). Within our food segment, in 2019, ambient food items and non-edible items accounted for 53%
(£8.8 billion), and fresh/produce accounted for 47% (£7.8 billion), of our food sales.

_Ambient_

Our ambient product category includes core grocery items (such as rice, pasta, baking supplies, canned
goods, condiments and cereals), impulse grocery items (such as snacks, confectionary treats, biscuits and
soft drinks), beer, wine, spirits, baby and toiletry items, non-edible grocery items (such as paper products,
pet care supplies, cleaning supplies and laundry-related items), newspapers, magazines and other kiosk
items, pharmacy (including health products and ambient medicines) and optical products. We believe that
certain of our own-brand ambient products, such as our Little Angels nappies and our Shades toilet rolls,
are among the most popular products of their kind on the market.

We have recently expanded the range of our plant-based and vegan food products within our overall
ambient food selection. In September 2020, we rolled out new offers and dedicated space in our stores to
over 70 plant-based products, in addition to our already strong Free From offer. New items offered include
vegan and plant-based proteins, cooking sauces, condiments, snacks and sweets. Our goal is to provide
vegan and plant-based foods at affordable prices and our intention is that these new vegan items will
eventually be rolled out across approximately half of our store network.

_Fresh_

Our fresh product category includes core chilled products (such as cheese, cooked meats, pies, salads
and dips, eggs and dairy products), fresh proteins (such as fresh beef, fresh pork, fresh poultry, bacon,
sausage and pre-packed fish), bakery (such as cakes, breads and morning goods bought and produced in
store), in-store café (such as beverages, main meals, snacks and drinks), food to go (such as sandwiches,
snacks, confectionary treats, salads and drinks) serve-over and self-serve counters (such as rotisserie,
pizza, Greggs, Panku, Sushi Daily, Kulaba Kitchen, ASDA takeaway and various local partners), frozen
(such as frozen meat, chips, vegetables, desserts, ice cream and frozen meal solutions) fresh ready meals,
soups and pizzas.

209


-----

_Produce_

Our produce product category includes fruit, vegetables, salads, nuts, plants and flowers.

Non-Food

In 2019, our non-food segment accounted for 15% (£3.0 billion) of our total sales of £19.6 billion
(excluding petrol and other), with clothing and general merchandise accounting for 8% and 7% of our total
sales (excluding petrol), respectively.

_Clothing_

Our clothing product category includes the George Clothing line which offers a wide variety of clothing
and apparel, including for baby, children, men, women, jewellery, footwear, socks and hosiery.

_General merchandise_

Our general merchandise product category includes George Home (kitchenwares, housewares,
electrical appliances, furniture, lighting, bath, kids items and furnishings and bedding), seasonal and
occasions products and toys (cards, celebration products, stationary, toys, hobby items and festive and
Halloween products), outdoor and essential items (sporting goods, automotive, hardware, paint, access
products and home and garden products) and entertainment (electronics, books and telecoms products).

**Our Other Services**

ASDA Pharmacy and ASDA Opticians

We operate complementary pharmacy and optical businesses that offer enhanced customer
experiences and diversify our cash flows.

We have 254 ASDA Pharmacies offering NHS, locally commissioned and private services to our
patients. These services include dispensing NHS and private prescriptions, electronic prescriptions and
collection services as well as our ASDA Pharmacy flu vaccine service for NHS and private
patients. Examples of NHS services we offer include our New Medicine Service in England, Pharmacy First
in Scotland and our Common Ailment scheme in Wales, each of which are commissioned by the home
nations.

ASDA Opticians offers our customers access to optical services and products in 156 stores and has a
dedicated online site selling contact lenses. In our stores, we complete eye examinations, contact lens
examinations and provide additional NHS services. Our in-store spectacle pricing model does not charge
extra to patients for prescription needs, including varifocals. We offer a wide contact lens portfolio of various
brands, designs and modalities. We also offer safety spectacles, sunglasses, eye care products,
accessories and contact lens solutions.

ASDA Money

We offer certain financial and insurance products on a commission-only basis. All products are provided
through third-party partnerships. The products we offer include home insurance, car insurance, travel
insurance, pet insurance, money transfer, breakdown cover, third-party gift cards, personal loans, credit
cards and travel money. See also "Regulation—Regulation Relating to our Money and Insurance Offers."

ASDA Gift Cards

We offer ASDA branded gift cards for sale in our stores and on our dedicated websites, which can be
used to buy goods in-store, on George.com or to purchase online groceries. Our gift card offer includes
ASDA's Christmas Savings Card, an ASDA-branded card that pays a bonus to customers in November
based on how much they have saved on their card up to that date. We also participate in pre-paid card
schemes through our business-to-business gift card programme, through which a commission is paid to
businesses to encourage end-users to shop at ASDA. Businesses who purchase ASDA gift cards can also
receive a discount on bulk purchases.

ASDA Mobile

ASDA Mobile operates as a Mobile Network Virtual Operator, offering pay-as-you-go mobile services
to customers. The ASDA Mobile network is currently powered by EE. In 2020, we entered into an exclusive
five-year agreement with Vodafone to begin operating ASDA Mobile. We expect our mobile network to be
transitioned to Vodafone during the first half of 2021. Existing customers using EE's services will be asked
to migrate over to the new network, which will have additional features and benefits not currently available
through the EE network.

-----

We sell our SIM cards in our stores at dedicated bays alongside mobile handsets. We also operate a
dedicated website where customers can order a SIM card. See also "Regulation—Regulations Relating to
_our Mobile Offer."_

Other Service Offers

We also offer our customers other services, including our toyou service, which allows customers to
collect and return orders from partner retailers at ASDA locations, ASDA Tyres (which sells tyres and
connects customers to local tyre fitting services via a dedicated online shop), and ASDA Media
Partnerships (an advertising service helping brands to reach and influence ASDA's customers through
digital, social, in-store and out-of-store advertising opportunities).

**Our Online Platform**

We offer online grocery shopping through our online ASDA groceries platform, including delivery
services for our customers' online orders, as well as our Click & Collect service. We also offer our popular
George Clothing and homeware range online through George.com.

ASDA groceries

ASDA groceries is our online groceries business. We sell our groceries through groceries.asda.com
and our mobile application. Customers place an order either for delivery or for collection from one of
approximately 460 Click & Collect sites. Delivery orders are fulfilled either from our home shopping centres,
which are dedicated fulfilment centres for online grocery orders, or from ASDA stores, depending on the
customer's location. This in-store online model proved effective in responding to rapid increases in demand
during the recent COVID-19-related lockdowns in the United Kingdom and we believe this demonstrates
our ability to scale our online offering quickly to meet customer demand.

Delivery to customers is primarily made by ASDA colleagues using our van fleet. For deliveries,
customers book a delivery slot and can choose to either pay per delivery or to sign up for unlimited
deliveries across a period of time for a fixed cost.

Online innovation continues to be a priority for us, as evidenced in our strategic partnership with
UberEats to enable convenience groceries to be delivered to customers quickly and our Express Collection
offer, which enables customers to place an order for collection within an hour.

In 2020, there were approximately 9.8 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with approximately
488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended February
28, 2020), and approximately 723,000 weekly orders post COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the
seven days ended September 30, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has increased use of and engagement
with our online platforms and we currently fulfil approximately 720,000 online orders per week.

George.com

We sell George Clothing and George Home products online through George.com.

Customers place an order either for delivery or collection from one of approximately 460 Click & Collect
sites. Delivery of orders is provided by third-party couriers, with orders prepared at our three fulfilment
centres. George.com also delivers to customers around the world. Following the Separation, it is intended
that Walmart will agree to permit us to continue to use the George brand internationally. For more
information about where we will be able to use the George brand following the Separation, see "Certain
### Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart—Trade Mark Agreement."

In 2019, we launched the George Rewards loyalty scheme, through which customers earn points as
they shop online and can use the points to unlock discounts.

**OUR CUSTOMERS**

We believe that our value proposition is particularly attractive to value-seeking families, younger
shoppers and lower-income customers. The chart below presents the life stage and income bracket
distribution of our customer base.

(Source: Kantar. Based on numbers of shoppers in the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020.)

**OUR BRANDS**

We operate generally under our well-known ASDA brand, for groceries, and George brand, for clothing,
footwear and homeware.

**_Own-branded food products_**

We have particular strength with our own-brand food products, including, among others, ASDA
Smartprice (our opening price point brand), ASDA (our mid-tier brand), ASDA Farm Stores (our line of highquality fresh and affordable food drawing on ASDA's long-standing farming heritage and working closely
with our approved farms, growers and suppliers), ASDA Extra Special (our premium product offer) and
ASDA Free From (our food offer for specific dietary requirements, such as gluten-free diets).

In the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020, our own-brand products accounted for 58% of our food
volumes and 47% of our sales value. Our own-branded product offer includes more than 7,000 SKUs.

Our award-winning approach to range development and innovation enables us to meet changing
customer needs; we launched approximately 850 new lines in 2020, with approximately 950 new lines
planned for 2021. Approximately 2,500 lines were reformulated in 2020. We are focused on building more
inclusive product ranges, as demonstrated by the launch of ASDA Plant Based (our range of plant-based
products).

In our own-brand products, we are committed to sustainability: we have set goals of using an average
minimum of 30% recycled content across all of our own-brand plastic packaging and to having 100%
recyclable own-brand packaging by 2025.

212

**_George_**

The George brand is another point of strength for us: George Clothing, which we sell in our stores and
on George.com, was the number two clothing brand by volume of units sold (excluding essentials, footwear
and accessories) in the United Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020 and is a
complementary offer to our grocery business. We also sell George homewares in stores and online. The
George brand was launched in 1990 and launched online in 2008, George includes George Clothing and
George Home. George Clothing is a sizeable, well-established and profitable business, with a leading
market share and position in childrenswear. The graph below shows our market position and market share
in the UK clothing market by volume of units sold for the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020.

(Source: Kantar. Based on volume for the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020.)

Clothing is a core component of our non-food offer and is a business line that benefits from strong
margins when compared to food categories. In 2019, 52% of the value of our non-food sales were George
Clothing sales and 20% of the value of our non-food sales were George Home sales.

The George Clothing product line is a sizeable business with strong online growth. According to Kantar,
in the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020, 25% (29.3 million units) of our 115.5 million units in clothing
(excluding essentials, footwear and accessories) sales were made online, with the remaining 75% (86.2
million units) being made in our stores. In 2020, we reorganised the George business, in part to respond
to trends across the clothing market which we believe have caused declining performance in our clothing
business in recent years, with the aim making buying operations more agile and re-evaluating our
markdown structure. We believe that these trends have impacted the UK clothing retail market generally,
with certain players being more seriously impacted, which we believe may result in increased capacity in
the market, which could favour our strategy for rebuilding margins.

Online sales participation for George.com has improved in recent years. The chart below shows the
online sales participation and year-on-year growth of George.com clothing sales for the periods presented.

(Source: ASDA information.)

The George Home brand is growing, having expanded to over £530 million of general merchandise
sales since inception six years ago and contributing approximately 38% of general merchandise sales in
the year ended December 31, 2019.

**OUR STORE FORMATS**

We believe we have a well-invested and geographically diversified store estate, 71% of which is freehold
calculated as gross square footage of freehold stores as a percentage of gross square footage of total
stores, as of December 20, 2020; freehold percentage also includes certain properties that are freehold
with a partial leasehold or which are leasehold properties for which the leases have been classed as long
leasehold for the purposes of this calculation as those leases have nil or a peppercorn ground rent.

The map below presents the geographic split of our market shares by sales by region and site numbers
and the accompanying chart presents the geographic split of our site network (including 614 stores and 18
standalone PFSs).

(Source: ASDA information.)

We have historically operated four distinct store formats. The principal formats of our retail stores
include:

  - _Supercentres and superstores: Supercentres are our largest-format stores, which offer food and_
non-food products and typically include concessions (such as McDonalds and Subway), petrol as
well as in-store dining and refreshment facilities. We operate 30 supercentres (approximately 5%
of our total stores), 82% of which are freehold or long leasehold and which accounted for 11% of
our store-based revenue (which is all revenue that is derived from stores (including grocery home
shopping orders fulfilled from stores, as opposed to the home shopping centres), and excluding
George.com, income from the distribution network and grocery home shopping orders fulfilled from
home shopping centres) in 2019. Supercentres generally have net square footage of 65,000 to
101,000 square feet and an average sales area of approximately 83,000 square feet. Superstores
are large-format stores featuring a food-led offer, as well as a non-food offer, including general
merchandise, clothing, concessions and in-store dining and refreshment facilities, with petrol being
offered at most of our superstores. We operate 396 superstores (approximately 65% of our total
stores), 73% of which are freehold or long leasehold and which accounted for 82% of our storebased revenue in 2019. Superstores generally have net square footage of 15,000 to 75,000 square
feet and an average sales area of approximately 42,000 square feet.

  - _Supermarkets: supermarkets are small-format stores focused on food, with a limited general_
merchandise and George Clothing offer. We operate 155 supermarkets (approximately 25% of our
total stores), 83% of our supermarkets are freehold or long leasehold and our supermarkets
accounted for 5% of our store-based revenue in 2019. Supermarkets generally have net square
footage of 5,000 to 15,000 square feet and an average sales area of approximately 9,000 square
feet.

214


-----

  - _ASDA Living: ASDA Living stores are dedicated non-food stores that include general merchandise,_
George Clothing and George home offers. We operate 33 ASDA Living stores (approximately 5%
of our total stores), none of which are freehold or long leasehold and which accounted for 1% of
our store-based revenue in 2019. ASDA Living stores generally have net square footage of 15,000
to 39,000 square feet and an average sales area of approximately 27,000 square feet.

  - _Petrol filling stations (PFSs): PFSs include the current network of standalone petrol filling stations,_
including 42 small convenience stores with a limited range of food and non-food offers. We have
historically operated 305 co-located PFSs and 18 standalone PFSs, 81% and 94% of which are
freehold or long leasehold, respectively. PFSs generally have net square footage of 500 to 2,500
square feet. These standalone PFSs and co-located PFSs will be sold to EG Group pursuant to
the Forecourt Business Disposal or, to the extent we are required to do so to obtain regulatory
approval for the Acquisition, we will sell all or part of our forecourt business to third parties. For
more information, see "The Transactions—The Post Completion Disposals."

**OUR TENANTS AND STRATEGIC PARTNERS**

We work with a number of tenants and strategic partners that operate retail locations within our stores,
such as McDonalds, Gregg's, Sushi Daily, Timpson, Decathlon and Claire's, or provide other services to
our customers, such as UberEats, which provide grocery home delivery, B&Q, with which we are trialling
in-store and click & collect concession, and Music Magpie, with which we are trialling an offer of a range of
used DVDs, as well as EG Group, who are trialling our ASDA On the Move format, which is a wholesale
arrangement whereby ASDA's own brand products as well as branded products will be sold in third-partyowned smaller convenience store formats.

**OUR COLLEAGUES**

As of December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 140,000 individuals. Typically, our total number
of colleagues increases during peak retail periods, such as Easter and Christmas, due to seasonal hires.

We are committed to providing colleagues the training, education and incentives they need to
strengthen their skills and become part of our community.

Our colleagues are subject to standard employment terms, depending on their role, and are provided
with colleague handbooks (where relevant) and policies. We have union agreements in both the retail and
distribution parts of our business with the GMB Union and the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied
Workers.

We are committed to offering competitive compensation in line with market practices. For information
related to certain ongoing legal proceedings relating to wages, please see "—Legal Proceedings—Equal
_Value Litigation." We also offer variable compensation to colleagues, including those working in retail and_
distribution, to encourage performance based on the fulfilment of business targets.

**OUR SUPPLIERS AND LOGISTICS**

We operate a "hub and spoke" logistics network, with two hubs and two deconsolidation centres serving
33 depots throughout the United Kingdom. Our logistics model is designed to support our extensive store
and online businesses. This approach starts with suppliers that provide goods to our hubs and depots as
well as directly to our stores for certain products. Our hubs and depots supply our stores via our fleet. In
addition to in-store purchasing, ASDA and ASDA Logistics Services also offer customers home delivery
and Click & Collect services.

_Hubs: Our two hubs are split by category: our Lutterworth hub handles general merchandise and_
ambient goods, while our Doncaster hub, which is operated by a third party, handles general merchandise
and ambient products.

_Suppliers: We had more than 4,400 active suppliers as of September 30, 2020, the top 20 of which_
(excluding IPL and petrol) reflected approximately 35% of cost of goods sold (excluding VAT, for the
October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 period). These suppliers deliver goods either to a hub (such as for
ambient and non-edible products and non-food products), direct to depots (such as for fresh food, produce
and fast-moving ambient) or direct to stores (such as for bread). New suppliers undergo a number of checks
and procedures managed via the shared service centre team. If a supplier is identified as a third-party
intermediary, which is typically only relevant to goods not for resale suppliers presenting a bribery and
corruption risk, further procedures are required as part of the on-boarding and ongoing management
processes for that supplier, focused on anti-corruption. During the on-boarding of goods not for resale
suppliers, we undertake a compliance risk review covering topics including, among others, modern slavery,
information security and privacy. If compliance risks are identified, then we agree on and implement

215


-----

appropriate mitigation measures. Relationships with goods for resale suppliers are managed by the
relevant buying team within the commercial team. Our buyers are responsible for negotiating key terms,
including pricing, promotional activity, supplier income arrangements, and payment terms. For goods not
for resale suppliers, the applicable business owners manage the contract terms and arrangements. We
leverage supplier relationships to deliver supply chain continuity.

_Ordering process: the purchase order process varies according to the category of goods._

## •Goods for resale: Automatic orders are generated with suppliers based on stock levels / stock
availability, historical demand trends and forecast trends. This is applicable for the majority of food
orders. The supply team has manual override capabilities for automatic orders, albeit limited and rarely
required. Non-food products typically operate on a longer lead time. The orders are based on forecast
sales numbers provided to the supply team by the buying team and the commercial finance team.

## •Goods not for resale: Purchase orders are raised by the procurement team or the applicable colleague
and reviewed by the budget holder (the individual who is responsible for the budget to which the
associated cost relates) within that colleague's team.

_Logistics facilities: logistics facilities_ receive, process, warehouse and distribute goods for sale at our
stores. IPL, Forza and Kober are treated as suppliers and largely deliver to depots. In addition, we operate
home shopping centres, which are fulfilment centres for online grocery orders.

_Fleet: ASDA drivers deliver goods to stores and customers using fleet vehicles (approximately 1,150_
leased tractors and approximately 2,300 leased trailers), home shopping vans (approximately 2,800 leased
vans) or occasional spot-hire or use of third-party hauliers (figures as of January 6, 2021).

_Stores: aside from in store purchasing, we also offer our customers home delivery and Click & Collect_
service.

**IPL**

We believe we have a competitive advantage in food sourcing via IPL and its two subsidiary companies,
Forza and Kober, which enables a vertically integrated approach to procurement. IPL is an important asset
that provides valuable sourcing differentiation. In 2019, £1.5 billion was purchased through IPL, reducing
our overall costs.

Our 2019 product mix sourced from IPL was 60% produce, 28% protein, 8% beverages and 3% grocery.
IPL employed over 4,000 colleagues as of December 31, 2019 across its group of companies, and only
serves us. IPL receives products directly from producers and centralises sourcing, processing and
packaging. This disintermediation of export agents, import agencies, suppliers and packers is the
foundation of IPL's cost price advantage: IPL sources produce, cooked meats, wine, nuts and dried fruit,
plants and flowers and has a national footprint of nine processing facilities across the United Kingdom,
supported by seven overseas technical/logistical operations. IPL's overseas offices provide us with the
benefit of being close to our foreign suppliers and sources, which we believe gives us greater insight and
control over our supply chain, conferring on us a competitive advantage as compared to competitors that
do not benefit from comparable vertically integrated procurement.

IPL operates with five business units: produce (sourcing approximately whole and prepared fruit, whole
vegetables, potatoes and onions, plants and flowers), protein (sourcing cooked meat and bacon),
beverages (sourcing wine), grocery (sourcing snack nuts, desserts and baking, cereal and other nuts and
dried fruit) and central functions (employing colleagues across IT, finance, legal and compliance and HR
functions). The key countries of origin from which we source products via IPL are: the United Kingdom,
Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark and other European Union countries, South Africa, Thailand, Brazil,
Vietnam and Bolivia.

**OUR QUALITY CONTROL SYSTEM,** **HEALTH AND SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES**

**Quality Control**

We are committed to providing customers with safe and high-quality products, including both our ownbrand products and name brand products. We have a due diligence framework in place which covers,
among other things, our supplier audit framework, our governance policies, product testing and our
specification management system. Our supplier audit framework measures compliance, supplier
performance against food safety hazard analysis and critical control point principles. In addition, we have
a quality management system that measures how our products perform in terms of quality.

To control the quality of the products we sell, we execute a number of quality control initiatives. We
conduct regular quality controls on the acceptance of fresh food at our depots. In addition, we analyse ownbrand product samples in our in-house sensory kitchens and through a third-party, Cambridge Market
Research, to ensure that our products meet our customers' expectations.

We conduct quarterly food safety audits at our stores to ensure that each store meets our required
standards for food safety and hygiene. We conduct annual refresher trainings for store colleagues to ensure
that they are trained in all relevant aspects of food safety, including allergen management.

All new own-brand suppliers must be Global Food Safety Initiative accredited and must pass a new
supplier audit before proceeding. In addition, all own-brand suppliers will have an annual unannounced
ASDA bolt-on food safety audit that measures supplier adherence to ASDA policy.

217


-----

When deciding whether to work with an own-brand supplier, we monitor the quality of its products based
on a control of samples delivered by the supplier during the selection phase. Following selection, we
regularly evaluate the quality of the products the supplier offers, including through randomly selected
samples. Our general supplier terms and conditions include a section dedicated to quality, safety, labelling
and traceability. By signing these terms and conditions, our suppliers confirm that they are fully aware of,
and comply with, our safety and quality standards. Furthermore, suppliers must adhere to our technical
manufacturing guide and associated policies for food as well as work with our own-brand technical teams
to ensure compliance with this guide and these policies.

**Health, Safety and Environmental Policies and Ethics**

We are committed to maintaining high standards of health and safety practices for our colleagues,
customers, visitors, contractors and anyone affected by our business activities. We therefore consider good
health, safety and environmental management as an essential part of our business performance and
culture. We formally monitor health and safety incident rates. Our health and safety policies and procedures
include:

        - managing risk and promoting a corporate culture that emphasises the benefits of health and
safety;

        - appropriate training and education of all colleagues to support legal compliance and best
practices; and

        - proactively conducting regular risk assessments and root cause analyses to provide and
maintain safe and healthy working environments to significantly reduce occupational injuries
or illnesses.

We carry out a range of monitoring activities to provide assurance of the effectiveness of our policies
and procedures. These activities are completed by both internal teams and external experts. We have a
wide variety of health and safety and ethics policies that address topics such as Food Safety, Food
Contamination, Warehouse Safety, Product Safety, Privacy, Environment and Environmental Services,
Anti-Money Laundering and Licences and Permits, among others.

We also have a number of policies that relate specifically to waste management issues, such as Food
and Drink Waste, Confidential Waste, Optical Waste and Pharmacy Waste.

**Our Environmental, Social and Governance Goals**

We are committed to reducing our environmental impact and having a positive social impact in the
communities we serve and we have a governance programme in place to support us achieving this aim.
With respect to our environmental goals, we strive to reduce carbon emissions, promote sustainable
farming and fishing practices, sustainably source ingredients like palm oil that make their way into our
products, reduce food, product and packaging waste throughout our supply chain and deliver a greener
proposition to customers at a great value. We have a demonstrated track record of giving back to local
communities through our ASDA Foundation, among other dedicated community initiatives, while also
striving to tackle wider social issues through fundraising efforts with long-standing partners such as Breast
Cancer Now and BBC Children in Need. In line with our commitment to public health, we also aim to
increase the proportion of low fat, salt and sugar content products within our own-brand offering. We
manage our commitments to environmental and social impact goals with our established governance
structure. We have compliance policies in place regarding privacy and ethics, grocery supply standards,
anti-corruption, anti-trust, licences, consumer protection and health and safety, all of which are managed
by qualified and experienced audit and legal teams. We also maintain clear work standards across our
supply chain and collaborate with our stakeholders as well as across industries and organisations to
improve working conditions, including through initiatives to promote the dignity of workers as well as combat
modern slavery. As a result, we have been recognised for our overall compliance with the Groceries Supply
Code of Practice. In addition, we have been actively engaged in passing on our best practices through our
ASDA Local Supplier Development Academies, which help small suppliers develop their capabilities in
logistics and sustainability.

**OUR TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS**

Our information systems are critical to our business operations. They provide management, analytical
and performance evaluation tools that assist management at all levels to undertake business processes.
Our technical infrastructure and computer applications are also used for the day-to-day management of
our business, including purchasing, sourcing, distribution, online sales, data exploitation, invoicing, cash
collection, reporting, consolidation and electronic data interchange. Our business depends on the ability of
our colleagues to process transactions on secure information systems and our capacity to store, retrieve,

218


-----

process and manage information. Our information systems are highly integrated, covering most of our
fundamental business service areas. The majority of our core systems are currently provided and managed
by Walmart, and we aim to migrate off of these systems onto alternative solutions following the Separation,
as part of a three-year transition process. We believe that our information systems are robust, adequate to
support our activities and operate at standards that are comparable to other operators in our industry. See
"Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation of
_ASDA from Walmart" and "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional_
_Agreements with Walmart."_

**OUR PUBLICITY,** **MARKETING AND CUSTOMER SERVICE**

Marketing is an integral part of the promotion of our brand, stores and products. We carry out a number
of branding and advertising initiatives through our stores, websites and mobile applications, as well as
through print, social and broadcast advertising campaigns. We work these through owned, earned and
paid channels. The key focus of our messaging to our customers is an emphasis on value, the innovative,
high-quality and well-priced products we offer and brand sentiment, services and ways to shop as well as
a focus on corporate social responsibility. We also have an online and paper magazine, ASDA MAG/Good
Living, through which we promote our products and brand values, as well as encourage customer
engagement with our brands and offers. Our ASDA Price News publication (which is available in online
and paper formats) promotes our value offer and competitive deals. We receive publicity for our innovations
in product range and quality across own-brands, which helped us to win 543 product awards, 200 food
awards, 343 beer, wine and spirits awards and 15 retailer awards in 2019.

Customer service is key to winning and retaining customers. We make customer service available in
our stores, online and by telephone. We also offer our customers loyalty programmes, such as George
Rewards.

**OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY**

We use a variety of trade names, service marks and trade marks in our business and rely on trade mark
and copyright laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual
proprietary rights. Our key brands are, among others: ASDA, George and George Home.

We believe that the brand names of each of our various banners enjoy high brand recognition and are
material to our business. Our intellectual property policy is centred around the protection of our brands,
associated logos and our domain names. This policy involves filings and reservations on either a local
country basis or in the full range of countries where we operate or wish to preserve and protect our rights.

Certain intellectual property rights related to ASDA, including trade marks, are owned solely by Walmart.
In particular, intellectual property rights relating to the George Clothing brand are owned by a Walmart
group company and used by both Walmart and ASDA. Following the Separation, Walmart will grant ASDA
a licence to use the George brand in the United Kingdom (for sale, marketing and distribution purposes on
an exclusive basis) and in certain specified countries in Europe (on a non-exclusive basis) where it is
currently used as part of ASDA's business (and is expected to grant ASDA a licence to use the George
brand in certain other territories outside the United Kingdom and such specified European countries (on a
non-exclusive basis) in substantially the same way as and to the same extent the brand was used by ASDA
immediately prior to the date of the Acquisition Agreement, as specified in, and subject to the terms of, the
TMA), in each case on and subject to the terms of the TMA, while Walmart will continue to own the brand
and use it in other territories. See "Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional
_Agreements with Walmart," "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated_
_with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart."_

**INSURANCE**

We maintain insurance coverage against the risks inherent in our various businesses. Our insurance
policies are currently placed by Walmart pursuant to an umbrella policy, which covers marine and cargo,
directors and officers, core property, terrorism and political, cyber, employment practices and crime risks.
Following the Separation, we will replace the umbrella policy that has historically been provided by Walmart
with our own insurance policies. We also carry combined liability (employee liability, public liability, products
liability, medical malpractice (for our pharmacy business) and motor, marine (for our toyou offer), non-core
property (material damage and property owners' liability), machinery movement and health insurance
policies in addition to the umbrella policy. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There
_are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart."_

To support our insurance programme (in particular the self-funding/deductible and aggregate
provisions), letters of credit are provided to our insurers for each policy year. These are amended from time
to time to reflect the existing and anticipated book value in each policy.

219


-----

We consider our policies adequate to cover the major risks of our business, and we believe that the
level of insurance which we maintain is comparable, in each case, to that maintained by other companies
in our primary markets operating in the same business area, but there can be no assurance that this
coverage will be sufficient to cover the cost of defence or damages in the event of a significant claim. See
"Risk Factors—We may incur liabilities that are not covered by insurance and could be exposed to
_significant financial risks if our insurance coverage proves to be inadequate."_

**REGULATION**

We are subject to a wide variety of laws, regulations and industry standards administered by local,
national and other government entities. The following provides a brief description of the main laws and
regulations that govern our activities. References and discussions to directives, laws, regulations and other
administrative and regulatory documents are entirely qualified by the full text of such directives, laws,
regulations and other administrative and regulatory documents themselves.

We are in regular contact and dialogue with relevant regulators and have subject matter experts across
the business who monitor and manage compliance with the regulatory frameworks within which we operate.

**Controlled Land Order**

We are subject to the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 (the "Controlled
**Land Order") which is UK legislation designed to limit the ability of large grocery retailers to prevent land**
being used by their competitors for grocery retailing in the future. The Controlled Land Order is administered
by the CMA.

**Groceries Supply Code of Practice and Groceries Code Adjudicator**

We are subject to the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (the "GSCOP"), which is UK legislation
designed to regulate the relationship between designated retailers and their grocery suppliers. GSCOP
provides detail on how retailers should manage their relevant supplier relationships fairly.

The Groceries Code Adjudicator (the "GCA") is the independent regulator of GSCOP.

**Food Safety, Hygiene, Labelling and Nutrition and Consumer Protection**

We have a food safety team, which forms part of our compliance team, to ensure food handling
procedures are monitored closely to guarantee product safety, quality standards and compliance with all
applicable food safety and hygiene laws and regulations. Scheduled internal and external audits are
conducted by qualified, third-party food safety experts to ensure procedural compliance and adherence
with our policies. This verification programme identifies and evaluates the hazards that are significant for
food safety and hygiene, taking account of the Food Safety Act 1990, the Food Information Regulations
2014 (as amended) and Food Safety and Hygiene Regulations in place across England, Scotland, Northern
Ireland and Wales.

**Regulation Relating to our Health and Wellness Offers (ASDA Pharmacy and ASDA Optical)**

With respect to our Optical offer, we are regulated by the General Optical Council ("GOC"). ASL is a
registered Body Corporate with the GOC, which allows us to provide Optical services subject to the GOC
Business Standards and the Opticians Act of 1989. Our professionals are registered as individual
registrants with the GOC and are subject to GOC Standards for Individuals and the Opticians Act of 1989.

We hold NHS mandatory contracts for all of our ASDA Opticians locations and are subject to the terms
of these contracts. In some of our English ASDA Opticians locations, we also hold Enhanced Services
contracts and are subject to the NHS standard contracts and local service level agreements.

With respect to our pharmacies, we are regulated by the General Pharmaceutical Council ("GPHC").
Each of our individual pharmacies is registered with the GPHC. This allows us to carry out pharmaceutical
activity from our registered premises subject to the Standards for Registered Pharmacies. Our pharmacists
are registered with the GPHC as individual registrants and are subject to the GPHC Professional
Standards.

**Regulation Relating to our Money and Insurance Offers**

_Financial Conduct Authority-authorised Entities_

ASL has been authorised by the FCA since 2017 and currently holds a limited permission to carry on
credit brokerage activities (limited to secondary broking). As a result of this authorisation, ASL is regulated
and supervised by the FCA.

_Appointed Representatives_

The Group includes two introducer-appointed representatives: ASL and ASDA Financial Services
Limited.

In addition to the FCA authorisation noted above, ASL is also payment services directive agent and
introducer-appointed representative that is currently involved in credit, insurance and payments
intermediation.

ASDA Financial Services Limited is an introducer-appointed representative which is currently involved
in credit and insurance intermediation.

In respect of these roles, ASL and ASDA Financial Service Limited are not directly authorised by the
FCA but may instead perform certain regulated activities and act as agent for firms that are directly
authorised by the FCA.

**Regulations Relating to our Mobile Offer**

_OFCOM Regulations_

ASDA is selling mobile communication services to consumers under the ASDA Mobile brand using EE's
network pursuant to a mobile virtual operator agreement with EE. See also "Our Businesses—Our Other
_Services—ASDA Mobile." The sale and supply of mobile communication services are regulated primarily_
by the Office of Communications ("OFCOM"), an independent regulator and competition authority for the
UK communications industries, within the framework set by the various European directives, the UK
Communications Act 2003 and other UK and European Union regulations and recommendations. ASDA
does not require a licence to operate the mobile communication services, however, it must comply with the
provisions of OFCOM's General Conditions of Entitlement that apply to such services.

**Regulations Relating to Electricity Purchasing**

We currently purchase our electricity on a wholesale basis via a dedicated subsidiary, which sells
electricity back to the rest of the ASDA Group companies. These electricity purchases are regulated by the
Office of Gas and Electricity Markets ("OFGEM"), which is the government regulator for gas and electricity
markets in Great Britain. In addition to OFGEM, we are also regulated by Elexon, which is the administrator
of the Balancing and Settlement Code. Therefore, the subsidiary which procures our power is subject to
the Performance Assurance Reporting and Monitoring System (PARMS) reporting regime which must be
submitted to Elexon on a monthly basis.

We are also required to submit certain returns to various government departments pursuant to
legislation including the Climate Change Levy Return submitted to HMRC, the Monthly Sales Report
submitted to the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and the Demand Forecast
Submission to the National Grid.

In 2021, following the Separation, we aim to transition from our existing wholesale purchasing model for
electricity, which is currently arranged through Walmart, to purchasing electricity on a retail basis. See
"Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation of
_ASDA from Walmart."_

**Data Privacy Regulations**

Through our in-store and online business, as well as certain of our other services (such as our money
and pharmacy offers), we have access to and may process personal data relating to our customers and
colleagues or any other individual in connection with the provision of our services (the "Relevant Data").
As such, we are subject to applicable laws and binding regulations on data protection and data privacy,
including the General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 ("GDPR") (such laws and binding
regulations together with the GDPR, "Applicable Privacy Laws"), which will form part of domestic law of
the United Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal Act) 2018 following the end of the Brexit
transition period. We will continue to review and develop existing processes to ensure that we comply with
Applicable Privacy Laws in relation to our processing of any Relevant Data.

221


-----

**Miscellaneous Regulatory Matters**

In addition to the foregoing regulations, in the ordinary course of our business, our operations and
properties are subject to international, national, regional and local laws and regulations of general
applicability, such as labour laws, laws on advertising, regulations governing our relations with our suppliers
and distributors, environmental, health and safety regulations, among others.

We operate a vehicle fleet that is subject to an Operator's Licence issued by the relevant local Traffic
Commissioner, the conditions of which are enforced through the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency. We
are also subject to road transport legislation and regulations that determine, among other issues, the
maximum weight that large goods vehicles and light vans can carry, and the maximum number of hours a
driver can work or drive over defined periods. See also "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and
_Regulatory Matters."_

**LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**

At any given time, we may be party to litigation or be subject to non-litigated claims arising out of the
normal operations of our business, including but not limited to colleague claims, disputes with our suppliers
and customers and disputes with our lessors as part of our real estate management operations. A
description of material legal proceedings and investigations to which we are party is below. See also "Risk
_Factors—From time to time we and/or our management are subject to claims that can result in litigation,_
_arbitration, tax or regulatory proceedings which could distract management from our business activities_
_and result in significant liability."_

**Equal Value Litigation**

ASL is a defendant in over 40,000 equal value claims (the "Equal Value Claims") that began in 2008
and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the "Employment Tribunal") in the
United Kingdom on behalf of current and former ASDA store colleagues, and further claims may be
asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by colleagues in ASDA's retail stores
is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of colleagues
working in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities, that the difference in pay between these job
positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in
warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants
are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities
and higher wage rates on a prospective basis.

In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could
compare their positions in ASDA's retail stores with those of colleagues in ASDA's warehouse and
distribution facilities. ASDA appealed the ruling and the oral argument was held before the Supreme Court
of the United Kingdom in July 2020. We are awaiting a decision.

Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will
determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by
colleagues in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities.

At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably
estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, we can provide no
assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and any losses that may arise from these
proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations
or cash flows. We believe we have substantial factual and legal defences to these claims, and intend to
defend the claims vigorously.

Under a separate indemnity undertaking, the Seller has agreed to indemnify the Purchaser in respect
of certain costs and losses incurred by the ASDA Group from Equal Value Claims filed with employment
tribunals, up to an agreed cap. As a result of these indemnity arrangements, even if the ASDA Group is
ultimately unsuccessful in defending any of the Equal Value Claims, we do not believe that such an
outcome would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations nor
our ability to meet our debt service obligations, including on the Notes, or other financial obligations as they
become due.

As of September 30, 2020, the Company had no material off balance sheet arrangements or funding
arrangements that would be classified as a contingent liability under IFRS, except for a contingent liability
relating to the ongoing Equal Value Claims. With respect to these claims, the Company has not recognised
a provision on the basis that any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings cannot be
reasonably estimated and any potential liability is only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be confirmed
whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic

Statements for further information on contingent liabilities. See "Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal
_Value Litigation" and "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters—From time to time_
_we and/or our management are subject to claims that can result in litigation, arbitration, tax or regulatory_
_proceedings which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability."_

Prior to the completion of the Transactions, Able Holdings Limited (a company owned by Zuber Vali
Issa CBE and Mohsin Issa CBE), Optima Group S.à r.l., Bellis TopCo Limited and Property Newco will
enter into a shareholders' agreement (the "Shareholders' Agreement"), which will govern various rights
of the shareholders of Bellis TopCo Limited and Property Newco in relation to their direct shareholding in
Bellis TopCo Limited and Property Newco and indirect shareholding in the Group.

Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, Able Holdings Limited (the "Individual Investors
**Shareholder"), on the one hand, and Optima Group S.à r.l. (the "TDR Shareholder"), on the other hand,**
will be entitled to appoint or remove directors in certain circumstances. The Individual Investors
Shareholder and the TDR Shareholder will each be entitled to appoint and remove (i) two members of the
board of directors of Bellis TopCo Limited and Property Newco so long as such shareholder, together with
its affiliates, hold 35% or more of the share capital of Bellis TopCo Limited or Property Newco (as

long as such shareholders, together with its affiliates, hold between 15% and 35% of the share capital of
Bellis TopCo Limited or Property Newco (as applicable). The maximum number of directors for the board
of Bellis TopCo Limited or Property Newco (as applicable) will be five and, subject to certain actions which
required the consent of the Individual Investors Shareholder and the TDR Shareholder, as summarised
below, all decisions of the board of directors may be made by a majority of the votes cast.

228


-----

The Shareholders' Agreement will provide that certain actions in relation to the Group may not be taken
without the consent of either of the Individual Investors Shareholder (or any of the directors appointed by
it) and the TDR Shareholder (or any of the directors appointed by it). These include amendments to the
organisational documents of any member of the Group, variations to the rights attaching to the shares in
any member of the Group, the declaration or payment of any dividend or distribution by any Group company
(other than to Bellis TopCo Limited, Property Newco or another Group company which is wholly-owned by
Bellis TopCo Limited or Property Newco), a material change in the nature or scope of the Group's business
and the winding-up or dissolution of Bellis TopCo Limited, Property Newco, any of their subsidiaries or any
other Group company.

The Shareholders' Agreement will contain certain restrictions on the transfer by the Individual Investors
Shareholder or the TDR Shareholder of its shares in Bellis TopCo Limited, Property Newco or any other
member of the Group, including (other than transfers to certain permitted transferees, including affiliates)
an obligation to first offer any shares to the other shareholder before offering them for sale to a third party.

At any time on or after the third anniversary of the Acquisition Completion Date either the Individual
Investors Shareholder or the TDR Shareholder may propose an exit event involving the Bellis Group and
the Group, including the sale of shares in Bellis TopCo Limited and Property Newco; the sale by Bellis
TopCo Limited, Property Newco or any other member of the Group of all or substantially all of its business,
assets and undertaking; any public offering in respect of any shares in Bellis TopCo Limited, Property
Newco or any other Group company; the reorganisation of Bellis TopCo Limited or any other Group
company and the winding up of Bellis TopCo Limited in each case, on specified terms and subject to the
occurrence of certain conditions (an "Exit"). The recipient of such proposal regarding an Exit shall consider
such proposal in good faith, but shall not be obliged to accept such proposal. At any time on or following
the fifth anniversary of the Acquisition Completion Date either the Individual Investors Shareholder or the
TDR Shareholder may propose an Exit involving the Bellis Group and the Group. The recipient of such
proposal shall be required to accept such proposal provided that certain conditions are satisfied.

**Walmart Senior Shares and Special Participation Share**

On the Acquisition Completion Date, Bellis TopCo 2 Limited, Bellis TopCo Limited and Global Pinnacle
Corporation (among others) expect to enter into a shareholders' agreement (the "Topco 2 Shareholders'
**Agreement"), which will govern various rights of the shareholders of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited in relation to**
their direct shareholding in Bellis TopCo 2 Limited and indirect shareholding in the Group. The terms of the
Topco 2 Shareholders' Agreement will provide for Global Pinnacle Corporation to hold two classes of
shares: (i) the Senior Shares; and (ii) the Special Participation Share. Unless otherwise agreed between
the shareholders of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited (or where such transfer is made to a permitted transferee in
accordance with the terms of the Topco 2 Shareholders' Agreement or with the consent of the
shareholders), neither the Special Participation Share nor any of the Senior Shares may be transferred to
any person unless there is a simultaneous transfer of all of the Senior Shares and the Special Participation
Share to the same transferee.

Pursuant to the Topco 2 Shareholders' Agreement, Global Pinnacle Corporation, as holder of the Senior
Shares, will be entitled to appoint or remove one director to or from the board of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited
(the "Senior Shareholder Director"). The holder of the Senior Shares will have no voting rights as
shareholders of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited, other than in relation to certain matters that would materially
adversely affect the rights of the holder of the Senior Shares.

The holders of the Senior Shares will have the right to receive an annual fixed cumulative senior
dividend. Such dividend is payable on the principal amount of the Senior Shares plus accrued but unpaid
dividends. Bellis TopCo 2 Limited may elect to pay such dividend in cash or for such dividend to accrue
unpaid.

The Senior Shares will be mandatorily redeemed by Bellis TopCo 2 Limited upon the occurrence of
certain events, including upon an exit event involving Bellis TopCo 2 Limited. Such exit events include: the
sale of the ordinary shares in Bellis TopCo 2 Limited; the sale by Bellis TopCo 2 Limited or any other
member of the Group of all or substantially all of its business, assets and undertaking; any public offering
in respect of any shares in Bellis TopCo 2 Limited or any other Group company; or a change of control of
Bellis TopCo 2 Limited. The Senior Shares will further be mandatorily redeemed by Bellis TopCo 2 Limited
on the seventh anniversary of the issuance of the Senior Shares. Bellis TopCo 2 Limited may voluntarily
redeem the Senior Shares at any time subject to paying a make-whole amount.

229


-----

Pursuant to the Topco 2 Shareholders' Agreement, Global Pinnacle Corporation, in its capacity as
holder of the Special Participation Share, will have no right to appoint or remove directors to the board of
Bellis TopCo 2 Limited, but will have the right to appoint a board observer if no Senior Shareholder Director
has been appointed. The holder of the Special Participation Share will have no voting rights as a
shareholder of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited, other than in relation to matters that would materially adversely
affect the rights of the holder of the Special Participation Share.

The holder of the Special Participation Share will have the right to participate in 10% of any dividends
paid by Bellis TopCo 2 Limited to the ordinary shareholders and any exit proceeds payable to the ordinary
shareholders. On the occurrence of a public offering in respect of any shares in Bellis TopCo 2 Limited, the
holder of the Special Participation Share will have the right to redeem the Special Participation Share at a
price equal to 10% of the listing value of the fully diluted issued share capital of Bellis TopCo 2 Limited
following the completion of such public offering, subject to a minimum hurdle amount.

**CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS**

The Group enters into transactions with certain related parties or the Group's affiliates from time to time
and in the ordinary course of the Group's business.

**Transitional Agreements with Walmart**

On or around the Acquisition Completion Date, ASL and Walmart expect to enter into an ancillary
services agreement (the "ASA"), a trade mark agreement (the "TMA"), a transitional services agreement
(the "TSA"), ASL and Walmart (or, if agreed between the parties prior to the Acquisition Completion Date,
a Walmart affiliate) expect to enter into a global sourcing agreement (the "GSA"), the Company and
Walmart expect to enter into a deed of termination and release (the "Termination Deed") and the Seller,
the Purchaser and Walmart (among others) expect to enter into a transitional pensions deed (the "TPD").
In addition, a Transitional Electricity Supply Agreement (the "TESA") is expected to be entered into between
a subsidiary of Walmart (Texas Retail Energy LLC ("TRE")) and an ASDA entity called Power 4 All, on or
around the Acquisition Completion Date. The ASA, the TMA, the TSA, the Termination Deed, the GSA, the
TPD, and the TESA are referred to collectively in this Offering Memorandum as the "Transitional
**Agreements."**

**_Ancillary Services Agreement_**

Under the ASA, Walmart will agree to share (at quarterly meetings with ASL, or more frequently if
requested by ASL, acting reasonably) information on information technology developments, research,
know-how and innovation (collectively, "Innovation") that may be relevant to ASL's business in the United
Kingdom and which Walmart is using or intends to use within the Walmart Group from time to time. Walmart
will grant ASL a limited, non-exclusive licence of Walmart's intellectual property rights in respect of any
Innovation disclosed to ASL to enable ASL to evaluate such Innovation for use by ASL in the United
Kingdom. If ASL wishes to implement any Innovation, the parties will enter into good faith discussions on
the terms of that implementation (including the relevant charging model) which will be documented in a
separate written licence or agreement between the parties. Although Walmart's obligation to share
Innovation-related information will be effective from the Acquisition Completion Date, Walmart will not be
required to assist ASL with the implementation of any Innovation unless the parties agree otherwise and
reach a separate agreement.

The ASA will include customary warranties on the corporate existence and capacity of the parties. No
fee will be payable by ASL for the information-sharing services set out in the ASA. Walmart's liability to
ASL will be excluded in respect of the provision or receipt of the information-sharing services (subject to
certain exceptions including for fraud and for wilful breach of the ASA). The liability of both parties in relation
to the wider agreement will be excluded in respect of indirect or consequential loss or any loss of profit or
revenue, and ASL's liability to Walmart will be excluded where the loss is attributable to a breach by
Walmart of the ASA or TSA (both preceding exclusions subject to certain exceptions including for fraud).
The ASA will remain in force for two years following the date of its execution unless it is terminated by one
of the parties following the insolvency of its counterparty, a material breach of its terms (subject to a notice
requirement and a 30-day cure period, to the extent the breach is remediable) or by one of the parties
following its counterparty undergoing a force majeure event which has a material effect on the performance
of the counterparty's obligations.

**_Trade Mark Agreement_**

Under the terms of the TMA, Walmart, as licensor, will grant ASL a licence to continue to use certain of
Walmart's trade marks, domain names and brand-related intellectual property. The scope of the TMA is
expected to include licences of the George, Scan & Go, Smart Price and Rollback brands, certain domain
names, including George.com, as well as certain other Walmart-owned trade mark rights used by a
member of the ASDA Group between October 2019 and the Acquisition Completion Date (the "Licensed
**IP"). The TMA is expected to permit ASL to sub-license the use of the Licensed IP to specified permitted**
sub-licensees, including members of the ASDA Group, existing franchisees to which ASL has granted a
licence of the Licensed IP under franchise agreements in place as at the date of the Acquisition Agreement
and certain specified companies that are also owned by the Shareholders or funds managed by TDR
Capital LLP, provided Walmart is given written notice and the sub-licence fulfils certain conditions, including
that it is on terms that are no less onerous than the TMA. Additionally, the TMA is expected to provide that
Walmart cannot unreasonably withhold, delay or condition consent for ASL to sub-license the Licensed IP
to certain other entities including those that are controlled by the shareholders of ASL's ultimate holding
company, provided that the sub-licence fulfils certain conditions, including that it is on terms no less onerous
that the TMA.

231


-----

Manufacturing or packaging of goods bearing the Licensed IP may take place worldwide. The scope of
the licence for sale, marketing and distribution purposes is expected to be the United Kingdom only (on an
exclusive basis) and, for the George brand only, also specified countries in Europe in which ASL has been
using the George brand prior to the date of the Acquisition Agreement (on a non-exclusive basis). These
licences are perpetual and irrevocable, subject to the termination rights summarised below. The TMA is
also expected to include a non-exclusive licence to use the George brand in substantially the same way as
the brand was used immediately prior to the date of the Acquisition Agreement in certain territories outside
the United Kingdom and the specified European countries in which ASL has been selling George-branded
goods under a specified third-party e-commerce fulfilment contract immediately prior to the date of the
Acquisition Agreement (the "George RoW Licence"). Walmart is expected to grant ASL: (i) a limited
transitional non-exclusive royalty-free licence in the United Kingdom in respect of the Walmart spark logo
to allow ASL to continue to print (packaging for products for sale in the United Kingdom for a period of four
months from the Acquisition Completion Date (and then to sell down those products, provided that ASL
uses commercially reasonable efforts to sell off all products bearing such logo as soon as reasonably
practicable following the expiry of a 12-month period and in any event within two years of the Acquisition
Completion Date, although it is expected that ASL will not be required to remove from sale or destroy any
packaging bearing such logo on goods which are available for purchase within any of ASL's stores at the
end of the two year period); and (ii) a limited non-exclusive royalty-free transitional licence to use the phrase
"Save Money Live Better" (in respect of new marketing communications and new internal communications
in the United Kingdom) until the end of 2021 or, if earlier, the implementation of ASL's new business
purpose. All use of the Licensed IP (other than use of the George mark in the United Kingdom) is expected
to be required to be in the same manner and style of usage as used between October 2019 and the
Acquisition Completion Date, except in respect of the George RoW Licence and licence of the Walmart
spark logo, which must be used in the same way as such branding was used immediately prior to the date
of the Acquisition Agreement and the Acquisition Completion Date respectively.

The TMA is also expected to include: (i) an exclusive, royalty-free licence from ASL to Walmart of the
Extra Special brand (that is owned by ASDA) to enable Walmart to continue selling, marketing and
distributing products sold by Walmart under such brand on a perpetual and irrevocable basis in specified
countries in Central America and in Mexico; and (ii) a transitional, non-exclusive, royalty-free licence from
ASL to Walmart of other ASDA-owned brands for 12 months to continue printing packaging in respect of
any other products sold, marketed or distributed by Walmart under such ASDA-owned brands, and in
respect of the territories in respect of which such products were sold, marketed or distributed by Walmart,
between October 2019 and the Acquisition Completion Date (and then a licence to sell down those
products, provided that Walmart uses commercially reasonable efforts to sell off all products in packaging
bearing such brands as soon as reasonably practicable following the expiry of such 12-month period and
in any event within two years of the Acquisition Completion Date, although it is expected that Walmart will
not be required to remove from sale or destroy any packaging bearing such logo on goods which are
available for purchase within any of Walmart's stores at the end of the two year period). In respect of (ii)
above, the relevant ASL brands must be used by Walmart in the same way and to the same extent as used
by Walmart immediately prior to the Acquisition Completion Date. The licence to Walmart of the ASL brands
referred to above is expected to be subject to similar sub-licencing and termination provisions as the licence
to ASL of Licensed IP.

ASL is expected not to be required to pay any royalties in respect of the above licence of the George
brand (other than George RoW Licence), the licences of the Scan & Go, Rollback and Smart Price brands
or the transitional licence of the Walmart spark logo and "Save Money Live Better" (other than a nominal
£1 royalty fee). The George RoW Licence is expected to be royalty-free for up to 12 months (or earlier if
ASL achieves a $25 million threshold of net sales revenue in respect of its use of the George brand under
the George RoW Licence outside the United Kingdom and the European countries specified in the TMA)
and thereafter subject to the parties, discussing in good faith and at arm's-length with a view to agreeing a
commercially reasonable royalty (otherwise the George RoW Licence will be terminated). In respect of all
other Licensed IP, ASL will be required to pay an annual royalty equal to 3.5% of the net sales revenue
received by ASL and any sub-licensees in connection with the use of such Licensed IP.

The TMA is expected to include restrictions and quality control covenants from ASL including ensuring
that the products sold by ASL under the Licensed IP maintain certain standards, complying with brand
guidelines in relation to visual style and formatting and limiting ASL's use of the Licensed IP and its ability
to register the Licensed IP. These covenants are expected to include not committing or knowingly omitting
acts which would bring the Licensed IP into disrepute or damage, or weaken or be detrimental to the
Licensed IP in any material respect. ASL is also expected to be prevented from maintaining an online or ecommerce presence of any of the businesses (excluding the George business in the United Kingdom) in
respect of which the Licensed IP is permitted to be used except in substantially the same manner and to
substantially the same extent as the presence those businesses had in the period between October 2019

232


-----

and the Acquisition Completion Date (or in respect of the George RoW Licence, immediately prior to the
date of the Acquisition Agreement). ASL is also expected to indemnify the Walmart Group against any
losses resulting from use of the Licensed IP in material breach of the TMA and losses related to actual or
alleged defect in products or services using the Licensed IP (other than the Scan & Go or Rollback
branding), recalls of defective products and actual or alleged mislabelling or food safety issues related to
the Licensed IP (other than the Scan & Go or Rollback brands). There is expected to be no cap on ASL's
liability under these indemnities or limit on the heads of loss recoverable. The TMA is expected to include
warranties on the corporate existence and capacity of the parties to enter into the TMA but no other
warranties or representations (and any implied warranties, terms or conditions implied by statute or
common law are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law).

The term of the TMA is expected to be perpetual (other than: (i) the George RoW Licence, which will
terminate after 12 months if royalties are not agreed and which Walmart may terminate on a per country or
per goods/services basis where Walmart itself intends to use or authorise the use of the relevant Licensed
IP in that country (or if required by law), and (ii) in respect of the transitional licences described above).
Either party is expected to be able to terminate the licences expected to be granted to ASL under the TMA
on a per-licence basis following the insolvency of its counterparty or a material breach or repeated nonmaterial breaches of the terms of the TMA (in respect of the relevant licence and/or the relevant Licensed
IP) (subject to a notice requirement and a 30-day cure period, to the extent applicable). Walmart is also
expected to have the right to terminate the licences granted to ASL under the TMA on a per-licence basis
if ASL challenges the validity of the relevant Licensed IP or following certain change of control events, or
with respect to specific trade marks or specific categories or sub-categories of goods or services on 30
days' notice if the relevant Licensed IP is not put to material use for a period of two years. ASL, but not
Walmart, is expected to be permitted to terminate the licences granted to ASL under the TMA at any time
without cause subject to a three-month notice period. The licence to Walmart of ASDA-owned brands is
expected to be separately terminable, under similar terms.

**_Transitional Services Agreement_**

Under the TSA, Walmart is expected to agree to provide certain information technology services to ASL
on a transitional basis with effect from the Acquisition Completion Date. The services are expected to
comprise all information technology and telecommunications services (and related operational system
processes) that Walmart Group Companies provided to the ASDA Group in the 12 months prior to the
Acquisition Completion Date, and each such service is expected to be supplied by Walmart until the earlier
of (i) migration of the relevant service as part of the separation of ASL from Walmart; and (ii) termination of
the TSA in accordance with its terms by one of the parties (as summarised below). The services are
arranged into six categories (referred to as "service towers," which relate to stores, supply chain,
merchandising, back office, e-commerce and infrastructure/security) for charging and migration purposes.

ASL is expected to have the right to terminate any service tower, or the TSA in its entirety, on three
months' notice. In addition, either party is expected to have the right to terminate the TSA following the
insolvency of its counterparty or a material breach of the terms of the TSA (subject to a notice requirement
and a 30-day cure period, to the extent applicable).

The TSA is expected to include customary warranties concerning the corporate existence and capacity
of the parties and an undertaking to provide information and participate in discussions in connection with
the delivery of the services. Walmart is expected to agree to provide each service to a standard and in a
manner that is consistent with Walmart's provision of the equivalent service in the 12 months prior to the
Acquisition Completion Date. Walmart is not expected to be required to provide the services to, or to meet,
any more onerous standard or service level.

Walmart is expected to be required to use reasonable endeavours to obtain and maintain third-party
consents that are required for the provision of the services. Where a third-party consent is not obtained or
maintained, Walmart is not expected to be required to provide the relevant service (and the TSA will
terminate in respect of the relevant service without liability on the part of Walmart) and the parties will work
together to agree a workaround (including replacement, in-sourcing or early migration) in order to enable
ASL to continue to receive the benefit of the affected service. All reasonable one-off or ongoing costs of
obtaining and maintaining third-party consents or implementing workarounds are to be borne by ASL,
subject to Walmart consulting with ASL before incurring these costs.

The TSA is expected to require ASL and Walmart to agree to a separation plan within 120 days after
the Acquisition Completion Date and cooperate in achieving separation. Separation costs (excluding
internal costs of the Walmart Group) are to be borne by ASL.

The charges for the TSA services for the first year following the Acquisition Completion Date are
expected to be initially equal to and are capped at £142 million (excluding any VAT) (which the TSA is
expected to state has been calculated according to the actual amount of the 2019 intra-group charges

233


-----

incurred by the ASDA Group in respect of the equivalent services), subject to specified adjustments set out
in the TSA, and the cap on service charges subsequently rises by 1% per year thereafter. The charges
payable for services in subsequent years are expected to be equal to the charges for such services for the
previous contract year (subject to any reduction as summarised below) subject to an inflationary increase
of 2% per year. The charges per service tower are split on a fixed cost and variable cost basis. The variable
proportion of the charges is expected to reduce to the extent that ASL is able to achieve certain agreed
milestones in its separation plan and ramp down usage of the relevant service tower. If ASL requires any
service to be provided beyond a long stop date of three years from the Acquisition Completion Date, the
charges for any remaining services will ratchet up by 10% every six months.

The liability of the parties under the TSA is expected to be limited, where service-specific, to the amount
of fees paid or payable in respect of the relevant service tower during the relevant contract year. In the
case of liabilities that are not related to a specific service tower, the liability of the parties under the TSA is
expected to be limited to the total amount of fees paid or payable during the relevant contract year. Each
party's aggregate liability for each contract year is expected to be limited to the amount of fees paid or
payable during the relevant contract year. These limitations are expected to be subject to limited
exceptions, including in the case of fraud. Neither party is expected to be liable for any indirect or
consequential losses or loss of profit or loss of revenue and, to the extent Walmart's breach is caused by
a third-party default, Walmart's maximum liability to ASL is expected to be limited to the amount that
Walmart can recover from the third party (or an equitable proportion thereof to reflect the loss suffered by
the ASDA Group as compared to the Walmart Group). Walmart is not expected to be liable to ASL to the
extent the relevant liability is caused by a failure on the part of the ASDA Group to perform its obligations
under the TSA.

**_Global Sourcing Agreement_**

Under the GSA, Walmart (or, if agreed between the parties to the GSA, an affiliate of Walmart) is
expected to provide ASL with (or to procure the provision to ASL of) global sourcing services in relation to
apparel and non-apparel, including identifying manufacturers and suppliers on behalf of ASL and
supporting ASL's buyers in ASL's negotiation of prices, placing of orders and arranging of shipments. The
term of the GSA is expected to be two years from the Acquisition Completion Date unless the parties agree
to extend the GSA or the GSA is terminated earlier (in accordance with the termination rights summarised
below). During the initial two-year term, ASL is to pay to Walmart a commission of 5% of the net first cost
of merchandise procured by Walmart under the GSA. If the term is extended beyond the initial two-year
term, ASL will pay a new rate of commission agreed between the parties.

The GSA is expected to include customary warranties on the corporate existence and capacity of the
parties. ASL is expected to indemnify Walmart against claims for product liability or intellectual property
infringement resulting from goods sourced under the GSA (other than claims arising from the gross
negligence or intentional tort of Walmart under the GSA).

Each party is expected to have a right to terminate the GSA for material breach (subject to a notice
requirement and a 30-day cure period) or insolvency of the other or a force majeure event which has a
material adverse effect on the performance of the other party's obligations. Walmart is also expected to
have the right to terminate (subject to a notice period) if ASL is not making material use of the services
(determined by reference to a minimum purchase spend in respect of apparel and non-apparel shipped to
ASL in a rolling 12-month period). ASL is expected to have the right to terminate the GSA for convenience
on six months' written notice to Walmart.

Neither party is expected to be liable in respect of loss of profit or revenue and indirect or consequential
loss, and each party's liability to the other party is expected to be limited to an amount equal to 100% of
the aggregate of all commission that has been paid or would be payable to Walmart in, in the case of the
first contract year, that year, or, in any subsequent year, in the previous year (both preceding limits on
liability subject to certain exceptions including liability for fraud, gross negligence of Walmart or any of its
subcontractors and non-payment by ASL of due and undisputed charges).

**_Transitional Electricity Supply Agreement_**

Under the TESA, a subsidiary of Walmart, TRE, is expected to continue following the Acquisition
Completion Date to support Asda in the purchase of electricity and services that surround that purchase.
TRE have been providing this service since 2008 to an Asda entity called Power 4 All ("P4A"). P4A is a
licensed electricity supplier under the Electricity Act 1989 and that leads to a level of reporting which TRE
will continue to support for the term of the TESA. There are also multiple forward purchase trades of energy
in place with counterparties that are backed by Walmart Group guarantees. The intent is for Asda to procure
electricity and services from a new third party and when those arrangements are in place it is intended that
the trades are novated to the new supplier and the guarantees in respect to them will fall away. In addition,
Walmart is expected to retain some additional Walmart Group guarantees in favour of Distribution Network

234


-----

Operators in respect to P4A payment obligations for the term of the TESA to allow Asda to arrange for
replacement security (if required) to be put in place.

As of the date of this Offering Memorandum, the specific services TRE will offer, the price and service
levels are being negotiated. However, the principle has been agreed that TRE will continue to provide the
services that it is currently supplying for the term of the TESA, together with some transitional support to
allow Asda to take over the management of P4A. The parties intend the TESA to run until March 31, 2021
and no further.

**_Transitional Pensions Deed_**

Under the TPD, the Seller is expected to indemnify the Purchaser in respect of any losses incurred by
ASDA in respect of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme, provided that the indemnity will not apply if the
losses arise from a voluntary act by the Purchaser (or any other affiliate of Bellis TopCo Limited), including
failure by ASDA to comply with its obligations under the documentation governing the ASDA Group Pension
Scheme Buy-In (described in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations above). Walmart is party to the TPD and is expected to guarantee the obligations of the
Seller in respect of this indemnity. The Purchaser and Bellis TopCo Limited are expected to agree to
indemnify ASDA and Walmart in respect of any losses incurred by either of them in respect of the ASDA
Group Pension Scheme if the losses arise from a voluntary act by the Purchaser (or any other affiliate of
Bellis TopCo Limited), including failure by ASDA to comply with its obligations under the documentation
governing the ASDA Group Pension Scheme Buy-In. Liability under both indemnity arrangements is
expected to terminate on the later of: (i) three years after completion of the buyout of the ASDA Group
Pension Scheme; (ii) the date of completion of the winding-up of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme; or (iii)
(in respect of losses relate to tax only) five years after the Acquisition Completion Date. As described in in
Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations above, as part
of the arrangements in respect of the buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme ASL agreed to make a
loan facility available to the trustees of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme. Under the TPD, in the event
that a funding obligation arises under the loan facility which ASDA it is unable to satisfy, Walmart Inc is
expected to agree to use reasonable endeavours to provide short-term funding to ASDA to allow ASDA to
meet the funding obligation. Under the TPD, Bellis TopCo Limited and ASDA are expected to agree to use
all reasonable endeavours to complete the buyout of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme as soon as
reasonably practicable and to keep Walmart informed of progress towards completion.

**_Deed of Termination and Release_**

Under the terms of the Termination Deed, Walmart is expected to unconditionally and irrevocably agree
in respect of itself, and on behalf of each other Walmart Group Company, and the Company is expected
to unconditionally and irrevocably agree in respect of itself, and on behalf of each other member of the
ASDA Group that any intra-group arrangement between any one or more Walmart Group Companies and
any one or more members of the ASDA Group immediately prior to Completion are terminated upon
Completion and each member of the Walmart Group and each member of the ASDA Group is released
and discharged from all claims or demands by the other under, or in connection with, such intra-group
arrangements (including without limitation claims for negligence but excluding liability for fraud), whether
arising at or before the termination of such intra-group arrangement, in each case whether known or
unknown to Walmart or ASDA (excluding amounts outstanding, or which are to be invoiced, under the
terms of such intra-group arrangements by or from one party to the other for services performed prior to
the Acquisition Completion Date). Certain arrangements are expected to be carved-out from this
termination and release notably the (i) Acquisition Agreement, (ii) documents entered into pursuant to the
Acquisition Agreement (including the Transitional Agreements), (iii) intra-group arrangements relating to
the ASDA Group Pension Scheme; and (iv) any arrangements or guarantees between TRE, any member
of the Walmart Group and/or any third party(ies) relating to the supply of energy or energy-related services
in favour, or for the benefit, of ASDA. The Termination Deed is not expected to terminate, release or
discharge obligations in respect of intra-group indebtedness between the Walmart Group and ASDA or in
respect of intra-group trading payables and trading receivables between the Walmart Group and ASDA,
which in each case are to be repaid or settled in accordance with the Acquisition Agreement.

**Forecourt SPA**

On February 3, 2021, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer entered into the Forecourt SPA with Bellis
Forecourts Limited for the sale of the entire issued share capital of Acquisition 2 (or, if agreed between the
parties, another member of the Bellis Group (other than Bellis Forecourts or Holdco) or a member of the
ASDA Group that is or has become the owner of the Forecourt Business (including a newly incorporated
company) (a "Forecourt Business Transferee")) (following such company's acquisition of the Forecourt
Business). Completion of the Forecourt SPA is conditional on: (i) completion of the Acquisition; (ii) CMA
approval of the Acquisition and the IEO ceasing to be in effect (and. as a result, there being no law in effect

235


-----

preventing the sale of the Forecourt Business) and (iii) the seller and the buyer each being satisfied (acting
reasonably and in good faith) that Acquisition 2 (or, if relevant, the Forecourt Business Transferee) has
acquired the Forecourt Business. Completion of the Forecourt SPA will take place (on the date agreed
between the parties) as soon as reasonably practicable once such conditions have been satisfied (or, if
applicable, waived).

The consideration payable by the buyer is £750,000,000 less any value ascribed by the parties to any
Excluded Forecourt(s) or related assets located at an Excluded Forecourt (if any) that are disposed of or
agreed to be disposed of prior to completion of the Forecourt SPA (which value will be agreed between the
parties to the Forecourt SPA or, in the absence of agreement, based on any price paid for an Excluded
Forecourt by a third party or (where this does not apply and in the absence of agreement otherwise) based
on the relative fuel volumes sold at the Forecourt Assets in the financial year ended December 31, 2019),
subject to a working capital adjustment to the extent the actual aggregate net amount of petrol stock, cash,
trade payables and trade receivables acquired by Acquisition 2 (or the Forecourt Business Transferee)
(together, "working capital items") exceed or are less than an agreed aggregate value of working capital
items that represents a normalised level of working capital for the Forecourt Business. The Forecourt SPA
provides that this consideration will become due to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer at completion of the
Forecourt SPA, but will be left outstanding and will be payable in cash within five business days of
completion.

The Forecourt SPA sets out the key terms to apply to the transfer of the Forecourt Business to
Acquisition 2 or the Forecourt Business Transferee and for the parties to consult on various matters relating
to the structure and detail of the transfer of the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 or the Forecourt
Business Transferee.

The Forecourt SPA includes customary warranties on capacity and ownership of the shares in
Acquisition 2 or the Forecourt Business Transferee provided by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and on
capacity to enter into the Forecourt SPA from Bellis Forecourts Limited. The maximum aggregate liability
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Forecourt SPA is capped at the consideration payable to it
under the Forecourt SPA. The Forecourt SPA provides for the parties to agree an appropriate regime for
the provision (by a member of the Bellis Group or the ASDA Group) of customary warranties in relation to
the Forecourt Business (from which Bellis Forecourt will (directly or indirectly) benefit) and indemnities
customary to a business sale (including in relation to pre-completion liabilities of the Forecourt Business)
prior to completion of the Forecourt SPA.

**EG Forecourt SPA**

On February 3, 2021, Property Newco and Bellis TopCo Limited and Euro Garages Limited entered into
the EG Forecourt SPA for the indirect sale of the Forecourt Business to Euro Garages Limited (or a member
of the EG Group) by way of a sale of the entire issued share capital of Holdco (once the acquisition by
Bellis Forecourts Limited of the shares in Acquisition 2 or the Forecourt Business Transferee has completed
pursuant to the Forecourt SPA) (or, if agreed between the parties, another member of the Bellis Group or
the ASDA Group that is the direct or indirect owner of the Forecourt Business (including, in connection with
the novation of Property Newco's obligations as seller under the EG Forecourt SPA to the shareholders of
Property Newco, the shares in Property Newco)). Completion of the EG Forecourt SPA is subject to the
same conditions as the Forecourt SPA and is, in addition, subject to Bellis Forecourts Limited acquiring all
of the shares in Acquisition 2 or the Forecourt Business Transferee. Completion of the EG Forecourt SPA
will take place (on the date agreed between Euro Garages Limited and Property Newco) as soon as
reasonably practicable once such conditions have been satisfied (or, if applicable, waived).

The consideration payable by Euro Garages Limited is an amount equivalent to the consideration
payable by Bellis Forecourts Limited under the Forecourt SPA less the aggregate amount of indebtedness
of Holdco, Bellis Forecourts Limited and its subsidiaries as at completion of the EG Forecourt SPA (to the
extent such indebtedness has not already been taken into account in calculating the working capital
adjustment referred to in the summary of the Forecourt SPA above), which will become payable on
completion.

The EG Forecourt SPA sets out the key terms to apply to the transfer of the Forecourt Business to
Acquisition 2 (or the Forecourt Business Transferee) and for the parties to the EG Forecourt SPA to consult
on various matters relating to the structure and detail of the transfer of the Forecourt Business to Acquisition
2 (or the Forecourt Business Transferee).

The EG Forecourt SPA includes customary warranties on capacity and ownership of the shares in
Holdco provided by Property Newco and on capacity to enter into the EG Forecourt SPA from Euro Garages
Limited. The maximum aggregate liability of Property Newco and Bellis TopCo Limited under the EG
Forecourt SPA is capped at the aggregate of the consideration payable by the buyer under the EG
Forecourt SPA and the aggregate of any indebtedness of Holdco, Bellis Forecourts Limited and its

236


-----

subsidiaries. The EG Forecourt SPA provides for the parties to agree an appropriate regime for the
provision (by a member of the Bellis Group or the ASDA Group) of customary warranties in relation to the
Forecourt Business (from which EG Group will (directly or indirectly) benefit) and indemnities customary to
a business sale (including in relation to pre-completion liabilities of the Forecourt Business) prior to
completion of the EG Forecourt SPA.

**ASDA Leases**

To secure the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, certain entities within the ASDA Group are
expected to grant first priority mortgages, fixed charges or standard securities, as applicable, over the
Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent required thereunder, certain Substitute
Retail Assets, as well as first-ranking pledges on the Designated Bank Accounts. Prior to the execution of
these mortgages, fixed charges, standard securities and pledges, as applicable, entities within the ASDA
Group are expected to enter into lease agreements in respect of the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail

gross internal area added by such alterations, subject to certain
exceptions.

the lease).

**Insurance ...............................** The landlord is expected to insure, save in circumstances where
the original tenant (being an ASDA Group entity or a group
company) is tenant in which case the tenant is to insure (unless it
elects not to).

The lease is expected to contain rent suspension provisions
(unless the tenant insures) and termination rights which apply in
certain circumstances where reinstatement of the premises as a

which require the landlord to provide advance notice of intended
forfeiture to the tenant's mortgagee.

Retail Assets, the Substitute Retail Assets and the Warehouse Assets. Where the foregoing states that
consent is required, the consent requirements are, subject to certain exceptions, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

In respect of Dagenham (a Substitute Retail Asset) a peppercorn rent lease will also be entered into on
substantially similar terms to the store lease, to demise certain land used by that store but held by a
separate group entity to the ASDA Group entity that owns the main store. The lease in respect of the main
store and the peppercorn lease will be linked for the purposes of assignment, charging, renewal, forfeiture
and other termination purposes.

**Senior Facilities Agreement**

Capitalised terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the Senior Facilities
Agreement.

**_Overview and Structure_**

In connection with the financing of the Acquisition, on February 5, 2021 the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
entered into a senior facilities agreement with, among others, Barclays Bank PLC, Bank of America Europe
Designated Activity Company, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, HSBC Bank plc, Lloyds Bank plc,

Sanpaolo S.p.A., London Branch, National Westminster Bank Plc and SMBC Bank International PLC as

The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for (i) a senior term loan facility in principal amount of up to
£195,000,000 ("Facility A"), (ii) euro- and sterling-denominated senior term loan facilities (collectively,
"Facility B") in an aggregate amount of £1,390,000,000 (equivalent) and (iii) revolving credit facilities in a
principal amount of £500,000,000 (the "Original Revolving Facility 1") and £190,000,000 (the "Original
**Revolving Facility 2," together with the Original Revolving Facility 1, the "Revolving Credit Facilities,"**
and the Revolving Credit Facilities together with Facility A and Facility B, the "Senior Facilities"). The
Facility B (EUR) (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) is subject to certain redenomination
mechanics pursuant to which the Facility B (EUR) will be redenominated into Euro in the event that closing
occurs prior to pricing, with alternative redenomination mechanics in the event that closing occurs after
pricing, in each case in accordance with the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement).

**_Borrowers, Currencies and Utilisations_**

Facility A and Facility B are expected to be utilised by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on the
Acquisition Completion Date and the proceeds of such utilisation are required to be applied (directly or
indirect) in or towards financing the Acquisition.

The Revolving Credit Facilities may be utilised by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and certain of its
restricted subsidiaries which accede to the Senior Facilities Agreement as additional borrowers of such
facilities, in sterling, euro or U.S. dollars and certain other currencies readily available in the amount
required and freely convertible into sterling in the Relevant Interbank Market (subject to obtaining consent
of the relevant lenders under the relevant Revolving Credit Facility), by the drawing of cash advances, the
issue of Letters of Credit and by way of Ancillary Facilities or Fronted Ancillary Facilities (each as defined
in the Senior Facilities Agreement).

If we settle the Offering after the Acquisition Completion Date, a portion of the initial drawings under
Facility B under the Senior Facilities Agreement will be repaid with the proceeds of the Senior Secured
Notes. The Senior Facilities Agreement is expected to be amended and restated either prior to or shortly
following the Acquisition Completion Date to make certain changes, including making Facility B an all eurodenominated facility (the "Amended SFA").

**_Purpose_**

All amounts borrowed under Facility A and Facility B are required to be applied (directly or indirectly) in

**_Availability_**

Facility A and Facility B are available to be utilised from (and including) the date of the Senior Facilities
Agreement to and including the last day of the Certain Funds Period (as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement).

The Revolving Credit Facilities may be utilised from (and including) the Closing Date (as defined in the
Senior Facilities Agreement) to and including the date falling one month prior to the respective termination
dates of the Revolving Credit Facilities. The Original Revolving Facility 1 has a termination date falling
54 months after the Closing Date, and the Original Revolving Facility 2 has a termination date falling
364 days after the Closing Date. The Original Revolving Facility 2 may not be utilised unless on the
proposed Utilisation Date the Original Revolving Facility 1 is utilised in full (but, for the avoidance of doubt,
the Original Revolving Facility 2 may be utilised contemporaneously with the Original Revolving Facility 1).

**_Conditions Precedent_**

Utilisations of the Senior Facilities are subject to customary conditions precedent.

**_Interest and Fees_**

Loans under the Senior Facilities will initially bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR in
respect of loans denominated in euro, and for loans denominated other than in euro, LIBOR, plus an
applicable margin, which in each case will be subject to a decreasing margin ratchet based on the ratio of
Consolidated Senior Secured Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement) (the "Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio"). Furthermore, the applicable margin shall be
subject to further adjustment upwards or downwards depending on whether the Group's ESG Agency
Rating (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) (the "ESG Agency Rating") is more or less
favourable, respectively, than the initial ESG Agency Rating obtained by the Group following the Closing
Date.

If EURIBOR is less than zero, EURIBOR shall be deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under
Facility B and the Revolving Credit Facilities (as applicable). If LIBOR is less than zero, LIBOR shall be
deemed to be zero in respect of loans made under Facility A and the Revolving Credit Facilities (as
applicable).

A commitment fee will be payable on the aggregate undrawn and uncancelled amount of each Revolving
Credit Facility from the Closing Date (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) to the end of the
availability period applicable to the relevant Revolving Credit Facility at a rate of 30% of the applicable

243


-----

margin for the relevant Revolving Credit Facility. Commitment fees will be payable quarterly in arrears, on
the last day of the availability period applicable to the relevant Revolving Credit Facility and if the relevant
Revolving Facility is cancelled in full, on the date on which the relevant commitments under that Revolving
Facility are cancelled.

Default interest will be calculated as an additional 1% on the defaulted amount.

**_Repayments_**

The aggregate outstanding principal of the Facility A Loan(s) shall be repaid on each repayment date
specified in the table below in the percentage specified below:

**Repayment Date** **% of the principal amount of Facility**

**A Loans**

First anniversary of the Closing Date 0

Second anniversary of the Closing Date 5

Third anniversary of the Closing Date 10

Fourth anniversary of the Closing Date 10

Termination Date applicable to Facility A 75 (or, if different, such percentage
(being the date that is 54 months after the amount as is required to repay the
Closing Date) remaining aggregate outstanding

principal amount of all Facility A Loans)

The aggregate principal amount of any Facility B Loan(s) still outstanding on the date that is five years
from the Closing Date (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) shall be repaid in full on that date.

In respect of the Revolving Credit Facilities, each advance will be repaid on the last day of the interest
period relating thereto, subject to an ability to roll over cash drawings. All outstanding amounts under a
Revolving Credit Facility will be repaid on the termination date of such Revolving Credit Facility. Amounts
repaid by the borrowers on loans made under a Revolving Credit Facility may be reborrowed during the
availability period for such Revolving Credit Facility, subject to certain conditions.

**_Prepayments_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement will permit voluntary prepayments to be made (subject to de minimis
amounts), and will require mandatory prepayment in full or in part in certain circumstances, including:

 - from certain net cash proceeds received by the Group from certain asset disposals, to the extent not
otherwise applied for a permitted purpose and required to be applied in prepayment of the Senior
Facilities and subject to a de minimis amount (an "Asset Sale Prepayment"); and

 - unless otherwise agreed by the majority lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, for each
financial year (commencing with the first full financial year commencing after the Closing Date (as
defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement)), a percentage of excess cash flow in the event that excess
cash flow exceeds the aggregate of a minimum threshold amount and the deductible amount, which
percentage decreases as the Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio decreases (an "Excess Cash Flow
**Prepayment").**

In addition, upon the occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement),
at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's option (in its sole discretion) unless otherwise agreed by the majority
lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, either: (i) all outstanding undrawn commitments of each
lender under the Senior Facilities Agreement shall be immediately cancelled and outstanding utilisations,
together with accrued interest, shall become immediately due and payable; or (ii) each lender under the
Senior Facilities Agreement shall be entitled to cancel its commitments and require prepayment of its share
of outstanding utilisations within a prescribed time period. A change of control shall include:

 - any person or group (other than one or more of the Permitted Holders, as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement) becoming the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the voting power of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, subject to certain conditions; and

 - the sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the
Group, subject to certain exceptions.

At the election of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, amounts required to be prepaid pursuant to an Excess
Cash Flow Prepayment or Asset Sale Prepayment may instead be applied in prepayment of (i) other Senior
Secured Indebtedness (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) pro rata across such facilities, or (ii)

|Repayment Date|% of the principal amount of Facility A Loans|
|---|---|
|First anniversary of the Closing Date|0|

related definitions (with, in each case, certain adjustments), including (i) a requirement to deliver copies of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's audited annual consolidated financial statements to the Agent (as
defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) within 120 days after the end of each of the Senior Secured

repayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. The Senior Facilities Agreement also contains
certain provisions facilitating an IPO debt pushdown (see "—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions
_Following an IPO")._

Solely for the benefit of the lenders participating in a Financial Covenant Facility (as defined in the
Senior Facilities Agreement), the Amended SFA will require that, in the event that the aggregate amount
of all cash loans drawn under all Financial Covenant Facilities (as defined in the Senior Facilities
Agreement) (excluding any ancillary facilities and any utilisations of the Financial Covenant Facilities (as
defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) by way of letters of credit (or bank guarantees), any amounts
utilised to fund any original issue discount or flex related payments, fees or expenses or made on the
Closing Date (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement), and any rollover loans in respect of such
utilisations), less any cash and cash equivalents of the Group, exceeds 40% of the aggregate of (i) the total
commitments under the Revolving Credit Facilities as at the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement (as
reduced to reflect any prepayment, repayment or cancellation in full or termination of the Original Revolving
Facility 2 Commitments) and (ii) the aggregate commitments under any additional revolving facility
established after the date of the Senior Facilities Agreement, on the relevant testing date (the "Revolving
**Test Condition"), the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio does not exceed (i) at any time**
on or before the earlier of (x) the date on which the Original Revolving Facility 2 Commitments have been
irrevocably cancelled in full and (y) the Termination Date for the Original Revolving Facility 2, 5:10:1; and
(ii) at any time after the earlier of the dates referred to in sub-paragraphs (i)(x) and (i)(y) above, 4.90:1 (the
"Financial Covenant"). The Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio is based on the definitions
and adjustments in the Senior Facilities Agreement, which may differ from similar definitions in the
Indentures and the equivalent definitions described in this Offering Memorandum.

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains an equity cure provision enabling the shareholders of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make shareholder injections by way of debt and/or equity to the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer to (i) increase Consolidated EBITDA as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement

Agreement (a "Net Debt Cure"), or (iii) repay or prepay or net off against any outstanding loans or (at the
election of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) any cash drawings outstanding under any ancillary facility, in
each case so that the Revolving Test Condition is no longer met. The EBITDA Cure right may not be
exercised on more than five occasions during the term of the Senior Facilities. No more than two cure rights
(which are either EBITDA Cures or Net Debt Cures) may be exercised in three consecutive financial
quarters.

It is intended that certain agreed covenants and other provisions of the Amended SFA will fall away on
the satisfaction of certain release conditions, being (i) a listing has occurred which does not constitute a
change of control and the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement)
for the relevant period is equal to or less than 2.70:1, (ii) the long-term corporate credit rating of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer (or, as the case may be, any holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer)
is equal to or better than Baa3 according to Moody's or BBB- according to S&P and no Default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, or (iii) Facility B has achieved and maintained Investment Grade
Status (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default as under the
Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the Senior Facilities Agreement provides for additional events of default,
subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including (i) (for the benefit of the lenders
participating in a Financial Covenant Facility (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) only) breach
of the financial covenant; (ii) inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made; (iii) invalidity and
unlawfulness of the Senior Facilities financing documents; and (iv) material failure to comply with the
Intercreditor Agreement.

**_Governing Law_**

The Senior Facilities Agreement and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with
it, are governed by, construed in accordance with and will be enforced in accordance with English law,
although the information undertakings, restrictive covenants, events of default and related definitions

247


-----

scheduled to the Senior Facilities Agreement will be interpreted in accordance with New York law (without
prejudice to the fact that the Senior Facilities Agreement is governed by English law).

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of our creditors under our financing arrangements, the Senior
Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are expected to enter into (and the ASDA Guarantors
will accede to) an intercreditor agreement to be dated on or before the Acquisition Completion Date (the
"Intercreditor Agreement") with, among others, the Security Agent and the agents, arrangers and lenders
under each of the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement, the
Senior Secured Bridge Facilities Agreement and the Senior Bridge Facility Agreement. The Trustees are
expected to accede to the Intercreditor Agreement on or about the Issue Date.

By accepting a Note, holders of the Notes will be deemed to have agreed to, and accepted the terms
and conditions of, the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by English law and will set out various matters governing
the relationship of the creditors to our group including the relative ranking of certain debt of the Senior
Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Guarantors and any other person that becomes party
to the Intercreditor Agreement as a Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider, when payments can be made
in respect of debt of the Debtors or Third-Party Security Providers, when enforcement action can be taken
in respect of that debt, the terms pursuant to which certain of that debt will be subordinated upon the
occurrence of certain insolvency events and turnover provisions and provisions related to the enforcement
of shared security.

The following description is a summary of certain provisions to be contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement. It does not restate the Intercreditor Agreement in its entirety and we urge you to read that
document because it, and not the discussion that follows, defines certain rights of the holders of the Notes
and of the Trustees. Capitalised terms used but not defined herein have the meanings given to them in the
Intercreditor Agreement.

Secured Notes Issuer as Senior Secured Notes under the Intercreditor Agreement, and references to the
"Topco Notes" shall include the Senior Notes, any additional notes issued from time to time under the
Senior Notes Indenture, and any other notes, securities or other debt instruments issued or to be issued
by, or in relation to which a New Debt Financing has been made available to or by, a Topco Borrower (as

"Topco" to refer to the Senior Notes Issuer and "Senior Secured Notes Liabilities" to refer to the Senior
Secured Notes and certain other indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

**_Ranking and Priority_**

**_New Debt Financing_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides, subject to certain conditions, for the implementation of existing,
additional, supplemental or new financing arrangements or the assumption or incurrence of any liabilities
that will constitute, for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities, Cash Management Facility Liabilities, Hedging Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities,
Topco Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities or unsecured liabilities subject to the Intercreditor Agreement
(each, a "New Debt Financing"). The conditions include certification by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
that such New Debt Financing is not prohibited under the terms of the Finance Documents.

Such financing arrangements may be implemented by way of refinancing, replacement, exchange, setoff, discharge or increase of any such new, existing, additional or supplemental financing, guarantee or
debt arrangement under the relevant finance documents. In connection with and in order to facilitate any
New Debt Financing, each agent and the Security Agent (and each other person party to a Transaction
Security document or a Topco Independent Transaction Security document) is authorised and instructed
to promptly enter into any new security document, amend or waive any term of an existing security
document and/or release any asset from the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction
Security (as the case may be) subject to certain conditions, including as regards the terms of such security
(which shall be, unless otherwise agreed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or otherwise required by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, substantially the same as the terms applicable to the existing Transaction
Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security over equivalent assets).

Where any indebtedness ("Permitted Acquired Indebtedness") which is not prohibited under the
Finance Documents is incurred by or in connection with the acquisition of (i) a person or any of its
subsidiaries who, after the Effective Date, becomes a Restricted Subsidiary or merges, consolidates or is
otherwise combined with a Restricted Subsidiary, or (ii) in relation to an asset of any such person or which
is otherwise acquired after the Effective Date (together, an "Acquired Person or Asset"), any security,
guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss in respect of such New Debt Financing which is
subsisting at the date when the conditions to the incurrence of such New Debt Financing set out in the
Intercreditor Agreement have been satisfied (or is to be granted thereafter, including subject to any
condition or periodic testing) shall be permitted to subsist (or to be granted) and there is no requirement to
offer that security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance in respect of any other liabilities under any
Debt Document. No security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is required to be given
by any member of the Topco Group in respect of any liabilities (including under any Debt Document) (i) over
any Acquired Person or Asset if this would breach a contractual undertaking applicable to the Topco Group
or is excluded or exempt from being given under the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement), (ii) over any asset required (including subject to any condition) to provide credit
support in relation to any Permitted Acquired Indebtedness (other than as a result of any obligation to
extend any Transaction Security rateably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness), or
(iii) where the grant of such security, guarantee, indemnity or other assurance against loss is prevented by
the documentation in relation to such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness or would give rise to an obligation
(including any payment obligation but not including any obligation to extend any Transaction Security
rateably for the benefit of such Permitted Acquired Indebtedness) under or in relation thereto.

**_Permitted Payments_**

_Permitted Payments in Respect of the Senior and Super Senior Debt_

The Debtors and Third-Party Security Providers may make payment in respect of the Senior Lender
Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, Super Senior Liabilities and Cash Management Facility
Liabilities (together with the Hedging Liabilities, the "Senior Secured Creditor Liabilities," the creditors in
respect thereof being the "Senior Secured Creditors") at any time, _provided_ that following certain
acceleration events under the Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, any Permitted Senior Secured
Facilities Agreement, Senior Secured Notes Indenture or Permitted Super Senior Secured Facilities
Agreement or following certain insolvency events in relation to a member of the Group, payments may only
be made by Debtors or Third-Party Security Providers and received by creditors in accordance with the
provisions described below under "Application of Proceeds;" _provided that after the Designation Date there_
shall be no obligation to turnover any such payments received, other than those related to an enforcement
of Transaction Security or a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) of assets subject to the Transaction
Security.

Any failure to make a payment in accordance with the Senior Secured Finance Documents following an
acceleration event or insolvency event as required by the Intercreditor Agreement shall not prevent the
occurrence of an event of default under such applicable Senior Secured Finance Documents.

252

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Second Lien Liabilities_

Prior to the date which is the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge
Date, the Debtors, the Third-Party Security Providers and other members of the Group may only make

Second Lien Liabilities otherwise prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement) under the Second Lien

**Payments"):**

(i) if:

(A) no Second Lien Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding;

(B) no payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than

"Senior Secured Payment Default"); and

(C) the payment is (1) of any amount of principal or capitalised interest in respect of the
Second Lien Liabilities which is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreements
(in respect of the Senior Secured Liabilities), or, to the extent prohibited, any required
consents to permit such payment have been obtained, (2) of any other amounts which is
not an amount of principal or capitalised interest including all scheduled interest
payments (including, if applicable, special interest or liquidated damages), the accrual of
cash interest otherwise payable during a period when a Second Lien Payment Stop
Notice (as defined below) is outstanding and default interest on the Second Lien

amounts payable as a result of the tax gross-up provisions relating to Second Lien
Liabilities and amounts in respect of currency indemnities in any Second Lien Finance

Majority Senior Secured Creditors and Majority Super Senior Creditors (each as defined
below), or (4) amounts due under any syndication strategy letter relating to the Second
Lien Finance Documents;

(ii) if, notwithstanding that a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding
and/or (other than in respect of paragraph (L) below) a Senior Secured Payment Default has
occurred and is continuing and irrespective of whether any creditors under prior ranking
financing agreements have accelerated their debt or the payment is (without double-counting
any equivalent applicable basket in any Debt Document, but whether or not permitted by the
Debt Documents): (A) of ongoing fees under any original fee letter relating to the Second Lien
Finance Documents, (B) of commercially reasonable advisory and professional fees for
restructuring advice and valuations (including legal advice and the advice of other appropriate

(F) of any other amount not exceeding €4,000,000 (equivalent) in aggregate in any 12-month
period, (G) of any amount of the Second Lien Liabilities which would have been payable but
for the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice (which has since expired and where no
new Second Lien Payment Stop Notice is outstanding) which has been capitalised and added
to the principal amount of the Second Lien Liabilities or where that amount is outstanding as
a result of the accrual of cash interest payable in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities during
such period or any such amount described at (i)(C) above, provided that no such payment
may be made if certain events of default have occurred or would occur as a result of making
such payment, (H) for as long as an event of default under the Senior Secured Liabilities or
Second Lien Liabilities is continuing, of all or part of the Second Lien Liabilities being released
or otherwise discharged solely in consideration for the issues of shares in any holding
company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or Topco (a "Debt for Equity Swap") provided
that no cash or cash equivalent payment is made in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities, that

253


-----

it does not result in a Change of Control (as defined in any prior ranking finance agreement)
and that any liabilities under the Debt Documents owed by a member of the Group to another
member of the Group, to the Subordinated Creditors or to any other holding company of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer that arise as a result of any such Debt for Equity Swap are
subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement and the
Senior Secured Creditors are granted Transaction Security in respect of any of those liabilities
under the Debt Documents owed by any member of the Group to the extent such Transaction
Security is required to be granted pursuant to the terms of the Secured Debt Documents, (I) of
non-cash interest made by way of capitalising interest or issuing a non-cash-pay instrument
which is subordinated to the Senior Secured Liabilities on the same terms as the Second Lien
Liabilities, (J) if the payment is funded directly or indirectly with the proceeds of Second Lien
Liabilities or Topco Liabilities incurred respectively under or pursuant to any Second Lien
Finance Document and/or Topco Finance Document, (K) if the payment is of a principal
amount of the Second Lien Liabilities and made in accordance with a provision in a Second
Lien Finance Document relating to prepayment upon illegality or in relation to the prepayment
of a single lender in the event of a tax gross-up, increased costs or other indemnity becoming
payable and (L) if no Senior Secured Payment Default has occurred and is continuing and the
payment is a payment of principal, interest or any other amounts made on or after the final
maturity of the relevant Second Lien Liabilities (provided that such maturity date is no earlier
than that contained in the original form of the relevant Second Lien Finance Document as of
the first date of borrowing or issuance (as the case may be) of the applicable Second Lien
Liabilities); or

(iii) if the requisite Senior Secured Creditors and Super Senior Creditors give prior consent to that
payment being made.

On or after the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the
Debtors and the Third-Party Security Providers may make payments in respect of the Second Lien
Liabilities in accordance with the Second Lien Finance Documents.

_Second Lien Liabilities Payment Block Provisions_

A Second Lien Payment Stop Notice (as defined below) is outstanding from the date on which, following
the occurrence of certain material events of default, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the
requisite Super Senior Creditors or Senior Secured Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop
notice to be delivered) (a "Second Lien Payment Stop Notice") to the Second Lien Creditor
Representative(s) advising that the relevant event of default is continuing and suspending payments of the
Second Lien Liabilities, until the first to occur of:

(i) the date falling 120 days after delivery of that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice;

(ii) the date on which a default occurs for failure to pay principal at the original scheduled maturity
of the relevant Second Lien Liabilities;

(iii) if a Second Lien Standstill Period (as defined below) commences after delivery of that Second
Lien Payment Stop Notice, the date on which such standstill period expires;

(iv) the date on which the relevant material event of default has been remedied or waived;

(v) the date on which the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of whichever of the Super
Senior Creditors or Senior Secured Creditors gave the instructions for the relevant stop notice
to be delivered) delivers a notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Second Lien
Creditor Representative cancelling the payment stop notice;

(vi) the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date; and

(vii) the date on which the Second Lien Creditors take any enforcement action that they are
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement (see "Permitted Second Lien Enforcement"
below).

No Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be delivered by the Security Agent in reliance on a particular
relevant event of default more than 45 days after the occurrence of the relevant event of default. No more
than one Second Lien Payment Stop Notice may be served (i) with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances or (ii) in any period of 360 days.

Any failure to make a payment due in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities as a result of the issue of a
Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a Senior Secured Payment Default shall not prevent
(i) the occurrence of an event of default as a consequence of that failure to make a payment in relation to
the relevant Second Lien Liabilities or (ii) the issue of an enforcement notice in respect of an event of

254


-----

default under the finance documents documenting any Second Lien Liabilities (a "Second Lien
**Enforcement Notice") on behalf of the Second Lien Creditors.**

_Payment Obligations and Capitalisation of Interest Continue_

Nothing in the Second Lien or Topco payment block provisions will release any Debtor or Third-Party
Security Provider from the liability to make any payment (including of default interest, which shall continue
to accrue) under the applicable Debt Documents even if its obligation to make such payment is restricted
at any time. The accrual and Capitalisation of interest (if any) in accordance with the applicable Debt
Documents shall continue notwithstanding the issue of a payment stop notice.

_Cure of Payment Stop_

If:

(i) at any time following the issue of a Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or the occurrence of a
Senior Secured Payment Default that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice ceases to be
outstanding and/or (as the case may be) the Senior Secured Payment Default ceases to be
continuing; and

(ii) the relevant Debtor then promptly pays to the Second Lien Creditors an amount equal to any
payments which had accrued under the Second Lien Finance Documents and which would
have been Permitted Second Lien Payments but for that Second Lien Payment Stop Notice or
Senior Secured Payment Default (as the case may be),

then any event of default which may have occurred under a Second Lien Finance Document and any
Second Lien Enforcement Notice which may have been issued as a result of that suspension of payments
shall be deemed automatically waived without any further action being required by the Second Lien
Creditors.

_Permitted Payments in Respect of Topco Liabilities_

Prior to the first date on which all of the Senior Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Senior Secured
Notes Liabilities and the Second Lien Liabilities (together, the "Secured Liabilities") have been discharged
(the "Priority Discharge Date"), the Debtors, the members of the Group, the Topco Borrowers and the
Third-Party Security Providers may only make specified payments in respect of the Topco Liabilities, in
accordance with the finance documents governing such Topco Liabilities, subject to compliance with
certain conditions in the Intercreditor Agreement.

The principal conditions are that the relevant payment (if it is a payment of principal or capitalised
interest) is not prohibited by any prior ranking financing agreement, including any Permitted Super Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, any Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, any Second Lien Facility Agreement and any Second Lien Notes Indenture (or if it is so
prohibited, that all necessary consents have been obtained to permit it), no payment stop notice has been
issued to the agent or trustee for the relevant Topco Liabilities and Senior Secured Payment Default or
payment default (subject to a de minimis threshold in the case of amounts other than principal, interest or
certain fees) is continuing under the Second Lien Facility Agreement.

Certain specified payments in respect of Topco Liabilities are also permitted at all times, notwithstanding
that a payment stop notice is outstanding or such a payment default is continuing. These payments and
basket amounts are substantially similar to those referenced for Second Lien Liabilities in (ii) of "Permitted
_Payments in Respect of Second Lien Liabilities" above._

**_Turnover_**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, at any time prior to the latest
to occur of the Super Senior Discharge Date, the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the first date on which
all of the Second Lien Liabilities have been fully discharged (the "Second Lien Discharge Date") and the
first date on which all of the Topco Liabilities have been fully discharged (the "Topco Discharge Date")
(the "Final Discharge Date") any creditor (other than a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation
Date) receives or recovers from any Debtor, member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider:

(i) any payment or distribution of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to
the creditors under the Debt Documents other than any payment or distribution which is either
(x) not prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement or (y) made in accordance with the
provisions set out below under "Application of Proceeds;"

255


-----

(ii) any amount by way of set-off which does not give effect to a payment permitted under the
Intercreditor Agreement;

(iii) any amount:

(A) on account of, or in relation to, any of the liabilities owed to the creditors under the Debt
Documents (I) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of any
Transaction Security as a result of such an acceleration event, or (II) as a result of any
other litigation or proceedings against a Debtor, member of the Group or any Third-Party
Security Provider (other than after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event (as defined
below)); or

(B) by way of set-off in respect of any of the Liabilities owed to it after the occurrence of an
acceleration event or the enforcement of any Transaction Security as a result of such an
acceleration event;

(iv) the proceeds of any enforcement of any of the Transaction Security except in accordance with
the provisions set out below under "Application of Proceeds;" or

(v) any distribution in cash or in kind or payment of, or on account of or in relation to, any of the
liabilities owed by any Debtor, any member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider which
is not in accordance with the provisions set out below under "Application of Proceeds" and
which is made as a result of, or after, the occurrence of an Insolvency Event in respect of that
Debtor, member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider,

that creditor will:

(i) in relation to receipts and recoveries not received or recovered by way of set-off (x) hold an
amount of that receipt or recovery equal to the relevant liabilities (or if less, the amount
received or recovered) on trust for (or otherwise on behalf and for the account of) the Security
Agent and promptly pay or distribute that amount to the Security Agent for application in
accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, and (y) promptly pay or distribute
an amount equal to the amount (if any) by which the receipt or recovery exceeds the relevant
liabilities to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

(ii) in relation to receipts and recoveries received or recovered by way of set-off, promptly pay an
amount equal to that recovery to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement.

A turnover mechanism on substantially the same terms applies in the event that, at any time on or after
the Designation Date but prior to the Final Discharge Date, any Senior Secured Creditor receives or
recovers from any Debtor, any member of the Group or Third-Party Security Provider (x) any proceeds
from the enforcement of security or from a Distressed Disposal (as defined below) or following an
acceleration event or the enforcement of security, any proceeds arising from any of the charged property
or (y) any other amounts which should otherwise be received or recovered by the Security Agent except in
accordance with the provisions set out below under "Application of Proceeds."

**_Effect of Insolvency Event_**

"Insolvency Event" is defined as, in relation to a Debtor, Material Subsidiary (as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement) or Third-Party Security Provider, (a) any resolution is passed or order made for
insolvency, bankruptcy, winding up, dissolution, administration, examination or reorganisation (excluding
solvent reorganisations), (b) a composition, compromise, assignment or arrangement with any class of
creditors generally (other than any Secured Party) in connection with or as a result of any financial difficulty
on the part of that Obligor, Material Subsidiary or Third-Party Security Provider, (c) a moratorium is declared
in relation to any of its indebtedness, (d) the appointment of a liquidator, receiver, examiner, administrative
receiver, administrator, compulsory manager or other similar officer in respect of it or any of its assets, or
(e) any analogous procedure or step is taken in any jurisdiction, other than (in each case), frivolous or
vexatious proceedings, proceedings or appointments which the Security Agent is satisfied will be withdrawn
or unsuccessful or as permitted under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge
Facility Agreement or in any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement, Permitted Super Senior
Secured Facilities Agreement or a Second Lien Facility Agreement, or otherwise not constituting a default.

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any party
entitled to receive a distribution out of the assets of a Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third-Party Security
Provider (in the case of a Senior Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such
amounts constitute proceeds of enforcement) shall direct the person responsible for the distribution to pay

256


-----

that distribution to the Security Agent until the liabilities owing to the Secured Parties have been paid in full.
The Security Agent shall apply all such distributions paid to it in accordance with the provisions set out
under "Application of _Proceeds" below._

To the extent any member of the Group's or Third-Party Security Provider's liabilities to creditors are,
with certain exceptions, discharged by way of set-off (mandatory or otherwise and in the case of a Senior
Secured Creditor on or after the Designation Date, only to the extent such amounts constitute proceeds of
enforcement) after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, any creditor benefiting from such set-off shall
pay an amount equal to the amount of the liabilities owed to it which are discharged by that set-off to the
Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set out under "Application of Proceeds"
below.

If the Security Agent or any other Secured Party receives a distribution in a form other than in cash in
respect of any liabilities, the liabilities will not be reduced by that distribution until and except to the extent
the realisation proceeds are actually applied towards such liabilities.

Subject to certain netting and set-off rights under ancillary or cash management facilities, each creditor
irrevocably authorises the Security Agent to take Enforcement Action (as defined below), make demands,
collect and receive distributions, file claims and take other actions necessary to make recovery after the
occurrence of an Insolvency Event in relation to an Obligor, member of the Group or Third-Party Security
Provider. The creditors agree to do all things the Security Agent reasonably requests in order to give effect
to these provisions.

**_Security Enforcement Regime_**

_Instructing Group_

(a) if the Designation Date has not occurred:

(i) prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors;

(ii) on or after the Senior Secured Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date,
the Majority Second Lien Creditors; and

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Majority

(b) at any time on or after the occurrence of the Designation Date and:

(i) prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the first date on which the
Super Senior Liabilities have been fully and finally discharged (the "Super Senior
**Discharge Date"), the Senior Secured Creditors (other than the Super Senior Creditors)**
representing more than 50% of the Senior Secured Liabilities (other than the Super
Senior Liabilities) (the "Majority Senior Secured Creditors"), and Super Senior
Creditors representing more than 50% of the Super Senior Liabilities (the "Majority
**Super Senior Creditors") save that, for instructions relating to enforcement, it shall**
mean the group of Secured Creditors entitled to give instructions in accordance with the
enforcement regime described under "Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the
_Designation Date" and "Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation_
_Date" below;_

(ii) on or after the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super Senior
Discharge Date but before the Priority Discharge Date, the Second Lien Creditors
representing more than 50% of the Second Lien Liabilities (the "Majority Second Lien
**Creditors"); and**

(iii) on or after the Priority Discharge Date but before the Topco Discharge Date, the Topco
Creditors representing more than 50% of the Topco Liabilities (the "Majority Topco
**Creditors").**

_Enforcement of Transaction Security Prior to the Designation Date_

Prior to the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise by (i) the Instructing Group, (ii) if, prior to the Senior Secured Discharge Date,
the Instructing Group has (A) given no instructions or has instructed the Security Agent neither to enforce
or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider to make a Distressed
Disposal (as defined below), an agent or trustee under the Second Lien Liabilities (acting on the instructions
of the Majority Second Lien Creditors) where the rights of the Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen

257


-----

under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (iii) if, prior to the Priority Discharge Date, the Instructing Group (or
Majority Second Lien Creditors as applicable) have (A) given no instructions or have instructed the Security
Agent neither to enforce or cease enforcing and (B) not required any Debtor or Third-Party Security
Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, a Topco Agent or the Topco Notes Trustee (acting on the
instructions of the Majority Topco Creditors).

Subject to the Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with its terms, the
Instructing Group or any other persons entitled to give instructions in accordance with the preceding
paragraph may give or refrain from giving instructions to the Security Agent to enforce, or refrain from
enforcing, the Transaction Security as they see fit.

Notwithstanding the above paragraphs, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second Lien
Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions to enforce the Transaction
Security either give no such instruction or do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the
Instructing Group may give instructions to the Security Agent to enforce the Transaction Security as the
Instructing Group sees fit and the Security Agent shall act on such instructions received from the Instructing
Group.

Unless (i) the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a result of an Insolvency Event or (ii) the
Instructing Group or any agent of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group determines in good
faith that to do so could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the Security Agent's
ability to enforce the Transaction Security or the realisation proceeds of any such enforcement, before
giving any instructions to enforce the Transaction Security or take any other enforcement action the agents
of the creditors represented in the Instructing Group will be required to consult with each other agent
(provided that any agent or trustee in respect of Topco Liabilities need only be consulted if such
enforcement relates to Topco Shared Security) and the Security Agent in good faith for a period of up to
10 business days (the "Consultation Period") and the Instructing Group will only be entitled to give the
enforcement instructions described above or take any Enforcement Action after the expiry of such
Consultation Period.

_Enforcement of Transaction Security on or After the Designation Date_

On or after the Designation Date, the Security Agent may refrain from enforcing the Transaction Security
unless instructed otherwise in accordance with the provisions described in the following paragraphs.

If the Transaction Security has become enforceable, if either the Majority Super Senior Creditors or the
Majority Senior Secured Creditors wish to issue enforcement instructions, they shall deliver a copy of those
instructions (an "Initial Enforcement Notice") to the Security Agent and to the other agents, trustees and
hedge counterparties.

The Security Agent will act in accordance with any instructions (provided that they are consistent with
the Enforcement Principles (as defined below)) received from (i) the Majority Senior Secured Creditors,
(ii) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the method of enforcement
they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue within three months of the Initial Enforcement Notice or
the Super Senior Discharge Date has not occurred within six months of the Initial Enforcement Notice, the
Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge Date has occurred, (iii) if an Insolvency
Event (other than an Insolvency Event directly caused by enforcement action taken at the request of a
Super Senior Creditor) is continuing, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior Discharge
Date has occurred, (iv) if the Majority Senior Secured Creditors have not made a determination as to the
method of enforcement they wish to instruct the Security Agent to pursue and the Majority Super Senior
Creditors determine in good faith that a delay could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse
effect on the Security Agent's ability to enforce the Transaction Security or on the realisation of proceeds
and the Majority Super Senior Creditors deliver instructions which they reasonably believe to be consistent
with the Enforcement Principles and necessary or advisable to enhance the prospects of achieving the
Enforcement Objective (as defined below) before the Security Agent has received any instructions from
the Majority Senior Secured Creditors, the Majority Super Senior Creditors, until the Super Senior
Discharge Date has occurred, (v) if, prior to the later of the Senior Secured Discharge Date and the Super
Senior Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors have
not given instructions or they have instructed the Security Agent not to enforce or cease enforcing the
Transaction Security and neither the Majority Senior Secured Creditor or the Majority Super Senior
Creditors has required any Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the
Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Second Lien Creditors), where the rights of the
Second Lien Creditors to enforce have arisen under the Intercreditor Agreement, or (vi) if, prior to the
Priority Discharge Date, the Majority Senior Secured Creditors or the Majority Super Senior Creditors or
the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) have not given instructions or they have instructed the
Security Agent not to enforce or cease enforcing or the Transaction Security and neither the Majority Senior

258


-----

Secured Creditors nor the Majority Super Senior Creditors has required any Debtor or Third-Party Security
Provider to make a Distressed Disposal, the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Majority Topco
Creditors), or the Majority Second Lien Creditors (as applicable) has.

Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if at any time the agents or representatives of the Second
Lien Creditors or Topco Creditors then entitled to give the Security Agent instructions either give no such
instruction or do not indicate any intention to give such instruction, then the Majority Senior Secured
Creditors or Majority Super Senior Creditors, to the extent such group is entitled to give enforcement

"Enforcement Principles" means certain requirements as to the manner of enforcement, including that
(i) to the extent consistent with a prompt and expeditious realisation of value, the method of enforcement
chosen should maximise the value realised from such enforcement (the "Enforcement Objective"),
(ii) certain proceeds must be received in cash, and (iii) enforcement in relation to secured assets (other
than shares) over €5,000,000 (equivalent) or shares, in each case, if not carried out by way of a public
auction or other competitive sales process, shall (if the Security Agent is requested to do so by the Majority
Super Senior Creditors or Majority Senior Secured Creditors) benefit from a fairness opinion from an
independent investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party professional firm which is regularly
engaged in issuing such opinions (subject to certain exceptions).

_Enforcement—Topco Independent Transaction Security_

Subject to the Topco Independent Transaction Security having become enforceable in accordance with
its terms, an agent or trustee under the Topco Finance Documents (acting on the instructions of the Majority
Topco Creditors) may give or refrain from giving, instructions to the Security Agent to enforce or refrain
from enforcing the Topco Independent Transaction Security as they see fit.

_Manner of Enforcement_

If the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is being enforced in accordance
with any of the above paragraphs, the Security Agent shall enforce the relevant Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security in such manner (including, without limitation, the selection of any
administrator of any Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider to be appointed by the Security Agent) as any
persons entitled at any time under the above provisions shall instruct it or, in the absence of any such
instructions, as the Security Agent sees fit (which may include taking no action).

No Secured Party (other than the Security Agent) shall have any independent power to enforce, or to
have recourse to enforce, any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security or to
exercise any rights or powers arising under the security documents except through the Security Agent.

_Security Held by Other Creditors_

If any Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security is held by a creditor other than
the Security Agent, then creditors may only enforce that Transaction Security or Topco Independent
Transaction Security in accordance with instructions given by the relevant instructing creditors in
accordance with the paragraphs above.

**_Enforcement Regime_**

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors_

Until the later of the Super Senior Discharge Date and the Senior Secured Discharge Date, except with

relation to the Second Lien Liabilities except as set out under "Permitted Second Lien Enforcement,"

the Intercreditor Agreement or any debt buy-backs pursuant to open market debt repurchases,
tender offers or exchange offers not undertaken as part of an announced restructuring or
turnaround plan or while a default was outstanding under the relevant Secured Debt
Documents); or

(v) petitioning, applying, voting for or taking any steps (including the appointment of any liquidator,
receiver, administrator or similar officer) in relation to the winding up, dissolution,
administration or reorganisation of any Third-Party Security Provider or a member of the Topco
Group which owes any liabilities or has given security or guarantees in respect of liabilities
owed to a creditor under the Intercreditor Agreement or any of such Third-Party Security
Provider or member of the Topco Group's assets or any suspension of payments or
moratorium of any indebtedness of any such Third-Party Security Provider or member of the

or to request judicial interpretation in relation to a Debt Document to which it is party with no claim for
damages, (E) demands made by intra-group lenders or Subordinated Creditors to the extent they relate to
payments permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement or the release of the liabilities owed to such creditors

Security as existed prior to the issue, (F) proceedings brought by an ancillary lender, a lender of Cash
Management Facility Liabilities (a "Cash Management Facility Lender"), hedge counterparty, issuing
bank, or agent or trustee in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities solely to obtain

relation to a Debt Document to which it is party with no claim for damages or in connection with any
securities violation, securities or listing regulations or common law fraud or to restrain any breach of the
Debt Documents or for specific performance with no claims for damages, and (G) the taking of any action
by a member of the Topco Group not prohibited by the Finance Documents.

_Permitted Second Lien Enforcement_

The restrictions set out above under "Restrictions on Enforcement by Second Lien Creditors" will not
apply in respect of any of the Second Lien Liabilities owed to it if at the same time as, or prior to, that action:

(i) a Super Senior Acceleration Event or a Senior Acceleration Event or a Senior Secured Notes
Acceleration Event has occurred in which case, each Second Lien Creditor may take the same
Enforcement Action (but in respect of the Second Lien Liabilities) as constitutes that Super
Senior Acceleration Event or Senior Acceleration Event or Senior Secured Notes Acceleration
Event;

(ii) a Second Lien Creditor Representative has given notice (a "Second Lien Enforcement
**Notice") to the Security Agent specifying that a second lien event of default (save and except**
arising pursuant to a breach of any provisions in the relevant Second Lien Facility Agreement
relating to cross default (including to the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal
Bridge Facility Agreement or any Permitted Senior Secured Facilities Agreement or Permitted
Super Senior Secured Facilities Agreement)) under the Second Lien Finance Documents in
respect of which it is an agent has occurred and is continuing and:

(a) a period (a "Second Lien Standstill Period") of not less than:

(1) 90 days in the case of a failure to make a payment of an amount of principal,
interest or fees representing the Second Lien Liabilities; or

260


-----

(2) 120 days in the case of an event of default under any financial maintenance
covenant in any Second Lien Facility Agreement substantially equivalent to the
Financial Covenant of the Senior Secured Credit Agreement; or

(3) 150 days in the case of any other second lien event of default,

or, in relation to any Second Lien Liabilities, such longer period (if any) as agreed between the
Company (in its discretion) and the Second Lien Creditor Representative in relation to such
Second Lien Liabilities and notified to the Security Agent in each case which has elapsed from
the date on which that Second Lien Enforcement Notice becomes effective in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) that second lien event of default is continuing at the end of the Second Lien Standstill
Period; or

(iii) at the same time as or prior to that action the consent of the Majority Senior Secured Creditors
and the Majority Super Senior Creditors for that Enforcement Action is obtained.

To the extent permitted under applicable law, after the occurrence of an Insolvency Event, each Second
Lien Creditor may (unless otherwise directed by the Security Agent or unless the Security Agent has taken,
or has given notice that it intends to take, action on behalf of that Second Lien Creditor) exercise any right
they may otherwise have against that Debtor, Material Subsidiary or Third-Party Security Provider to:

Material Subsidiary's Second Lien Liabilities or declare them prematurely due and payable or

Lien Liabilities of that Debtor or, as the case may be, Third-Party Security Provider or Material
Subsidiary; or

(iv) claim and prove in the liquidation, administration or other insolvency proceedings of that
Debtor or, as the case may be, Third-Party Security Provider or Material Subsidiary for the
Second Lien Liabilities owing to it.

_Option to Purchase: Second Lien Creditors_

Following acceleration or the enforcement of Transaction Security upon acceleration under any Senior
Secured Creditor Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities, Second Lien Creditors may, subject
to certain conditions, elect to purchase the Senior Lender Liabilities, Super Senior Lender Liabilities, Senior
Secured Notes Liabilities and the Cash Management Facility Liabilities for the amount that would have
been required to prepay or redeem such liabilities on such date plus certain costs and expenses. Second
Lien Creditors must also, at the same time, elect for the counterparties to hedging obligations to transfer
their hedging obligations to holders in exchange (subject to specified conditions) for the amount that would
have been payable under such hedging obligations had they been terminated on such date plus certain
costs and expenses in connection with any such purchase.

_Restrictions on Enforcement by Topco Creditors_

Certain of the features set out above with respect to Second Lien Creditors apply to the Topco Creditors,
with appropriate modifications for the relative positions of the relevant liabilities in the capital structure of
the Group.

**_Non-Distressed Disposals_**

The Security Agent (on behalf of itself and the other Secured Parties) and each other person party to a
document evidencing the Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security shall (and is
irrevocably authorised, instructed and obliged to do so without further consent, agreement or instruction
from any creditor, other Secured Party or Debtor), and without prejudice to its rights and protections under

261

transaction has been obtained); and

in each case where such disposal or other transaction is not a Distressed Disposal (as defined
below) (in each case, a "Non-Distressed Disposal");

(B) any security (and/or other claim relating to a Debt Document) over any document or other

given or the relevant release or cessation is otherwise in accordance with the terms of the Finance
Documents or the Agreed Security Principles (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement).

In the case of a disposal of shares or other ownership interests in a Debtor, member of the Group or holding
company of any Debtor or any other transaction pursuant to which a Debtor, member of the Group or

Senior Secured Notes Issuer has confirmed to the Security Agent that it is not prohibited by the Finance
Documents, if such member of the Topco Group or a Debtor is a borrower, issuer or primary debtor under
any Debt Document, such person shall have the right to voluntarily prepay all Liabilities outstanding under
any Debt Document to the applicable creditors.

**_Distressed Disposals_**

"Distressed Disposal" means a disposal of an asset or shares of, or other financial securities issued
by a member of the Group or, in the case of a Third-Party Security Provider, any assets or shares or
financial securities which are subject to the Transaction Security which is being effected (a) at the request
of an Instructing Group in circumstances where the Transaction Security has become enforceable as a
result of an acceleration event, (b) by enforcement of the Transaction Security as a result of an acceleration
event, or (c) after the occurrence of an acceleration event or the enforcement of security as a result of an
acceleration event, by a Debtor or Third-Party Security Provider to a person or persons which is not a
member of the Group.

If a Distressed Disposal of any asset is being effected, the Security Agent is irrevocably authorised (at
the cost of the relevant Debtor, Third-Party Security Provider and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
without any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor under the Intercreditor
Agreement, Third-Party Security Provider or Debtor):

(i) to release the Transaction Security or any other claim over that asset, enter into any release
of that Transaction Security or claim and issue any letters of non-crystallisation of any floating
charge or any consent to dealing that may, in the discretion of the Security Agent, be
necessary or desirable;

(ii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor to release:

(A) that Debtor and any subsidiary of that Debtor from all or any part of its borrowing,
guarantee or other liabilities;

(B) any Transaction Security granted by that Debtor or any subsidiary of that Debtor over
any of its assets; and

(C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated Creditor or
another Debtor over that Debtor's assets or over the assets of any subsidiary of that
Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors, Third-Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(iii) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of any holding company of a
Debtor to release (A) that holding company and any subsidiary of that holding company from
all or any part of its borrowing, guarantee or other liabilities; (B) any Transaction Security
granted by that holding company or any subsidiary of that holding company over any of its
assets, and (C) any other claim of an intra-group lender, a Topco Investor, Subordinated
Creditor or another Debtor over that holding company's assets or over the assets of any
subsidiary of that Debtor, on behalf of the relevant creditors and Debtors;

(iv) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor and the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement) decides to dispose of all or any part of the liabilities owed by such Debtor or
holding company or any of their subsidiaries to creditors or other Debtors:

(A) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does not
intend that any transferee of those liabilities (the "Transferee") will be treated as a
Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or
enter into any agreement to dispose of all or part of those liabilities, _provided that,_
notwithstanding any other provision of any Debt Document, the Transferee shall not be
treated as a Secured Creditor or Secured Party for the purposes of the Intercreditor
Agreement; and

263


-----

(B) if the Security Agent (acting in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement) does intend
that any Transferee will be treated as a Secured Party for the purposes of the
Intercreditor Agreement, to execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to dispose
of all (and not part only) of the liabilities owed to the Secured Parties and all or part of
any other liabilities,

on behalf of, in each case, the relevant creditors, Third-Party Security Providers and Debtors;

(v) if the asset which is disposed of consists of shares in the capital of a Debtor or the holding
company of a Debtor (the "Disposed Entity") and the Security Agent (acting in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement) decides to transfer to another Debtor (the "Receiving
**Entity") all or any part of the Disposed Entity's obligations or any obligations of a subsidiary of**
that Disposed Entity in respect of the intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to any Debtor, to
execute and deliver or enter into any agreement to:

(A) transfer all or part of the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities or liabilities
to any Debtor on behalf of the relevant intra-group lenders and Debtors to which those
obligations are owed and on behalf of the Debtors which owe those obligations; and

(B) (provided that the Receiving Entity is a holding company of the Disposed Entity which is
also a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Liabilities) to accept the transfer of all or part of
the obligations in respect of those intra-group liabilities, liabilities owed to Debtors on
behalf of the Receiving Entity or Receiving Entities to which the obligations in respect of
those intra-group liabilities or liabilities owed to Debtors are to be transferred.

The net proceeds of each Distressed Disposal (and the net proceeds of any disposal of liabilities as
described above) shall be paid to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions set
out under "—Application of Proceeds" below as if those proceeds were the proceeds of an enforcement of
the Transaction Security and, to the extent any disposal of liabilities has occurred, as if that disposal of
liabilities had not occurred.

In the case of a Distressed Disposal (or a disposal of liabilities) effected by, or at the request of, the
Security Agent, the Security Agent shall take reasonable care to obtain a fair market price in the prevailing
market conditions (although the Security Agent shall not have any obligation to postpone any such
Distressed Disposal or disposal of liabilities in order to achieve a higher price).

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Second Lien Creditors are entitled
to give and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is
not authorised to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or
guarantee liabilities or other liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor unless those borrowing
liabilities or guarantee liabilities or other liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities will be paid (or
repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash management facility
or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable to the relevant senior
creditor) following that release.

If a Distressed Disposal is being effected at a time when the Majority Topco Creditors are entitled to
give, and have given instructions in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent is not
authorised to release any Debtor, subsidiary or holding company from any borrowing liabilities or guarantee
liabilities owed to any Senior Secured Creditor or any Second Lien Creditor unless those borrowing
liabilities or guarantee liabilities and any other Senior Secured Liabilities or Second Lien Liabilities will be
paid (or repaid) in full (or, in the case of any contingent liability relating to a letter of credit, cash
management facility or an ancillary facility, made the subject of cash collateral arrangements acceptable
to the relevant senior creditor) following that release.

Where borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities in respect of any Senior Secured
Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities, Senior Secured Notes Proceeds Loan Liabilities, Topco Liabilities or
unsecured liabilities would otherwise be released pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, the creditor
concerned may elect to have those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other liabilities
transferred to a holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in which case the Security Agent is
irrevocably authorised (at the cost of the relevant Debtor or the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and without
any consent, sanction, authority or further confirmation from any creditor or Debtor) to execute such
documents as are required to so transfer those borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and/or other
liabilities.

If before the Second Lien Discharge Date or the Topco Discharge Date, a Distressed Disposal (or a
disposal of Liabilities pursuant to (iv) or (v) above) is being effected such that the Second Lien Liabilities or
the Topco Liabilities and Transaction Security over shares in a borrower, issuer or guarantor of, or over

264


-----

assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor of, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities will be released,
transferred or disposed of pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement, it is a further condition to the release,
transfer or disposal that either:

(i) the Second Lien Agent, second lien notes trustee, Topco Agent and Topco Notes Trustee (as
applicable) have approved the release, transfer or disposal (acting, in each case, upon the
instructions of the relevant Creditor group); or

(ii) where shares or assets of a borrower, issuer or guarantor in respect of Second Lien Liabilities
or Topco Guarantor are sold:

(A) the consideration for such sale or disposal is in cash (or substantially all in cash) and/or
other marketable securities or, if the consideration for such sale or disposal is not in cash
(or substantially all in cash) and/or other marketable securities, a valuation opinion has
been obtained in accordance with the provisions set out below; and

(B) all borrowing liabilities, guarantee liabilities and (to the extent permitted by the
Intercreditor Agreement) other liabilities owing to each of the Secured Creditors and
unsecured creditors by the Debtors and their respective subsidiaries being sold or
disposed of pursuant to such Enforcement Action (together, the "Relevant Claim"), are
unconditionally released and discharged or sold or disposed of concurrently with such
sale (and are not assumed by the purchaser or one of its affiliates), and all Transaction
Security, Topco Independent Transaction Security or other security in favour of the
Secured Parties in respect of the assets that are sold or disposed of is simultaneously
and unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with such sale, provided that
in the event of a sale or disposal of any such claim (instead of a release or discharge):

(I) where the Senior Secured Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Senior
Agent and the Senior Secured Notes Trustee (i) determine, acting reasonably and
in good faith, that the Senior Secured Creditors will recover more than if such
Relevant Claim was released or discharged but nevertheless less than the
aggregate amount of outstanding Senior Secured Liabilities, and (ii) serve a
notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

(II) where the Second Lien Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Second
Lien Agent and any second lien notes trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and
in good faith that the Priority Secured Parties (collectively) will recover more than
if such claim was released or discharged but nevertheless less than the
outstanding amount of the liabilities owed to the Priority Secured Parties (the
"Priority Secured Liabilities"), and (ii) serve a notice on the Security Agent
notifying the Security Agent of the same; and

(III) where the Topco Creditors constitute the Instructing Group, the Topco Agent and
the Topco Notes Trustee (i) determine acting reasonably and in good faith that
the Priority Secured Parties and the Topco Creditors (collectively) will recover
more than if such claim was released or discharged but is nevertheless less than
the outstanding Priority Secured Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities (collectively),
and serve a notice on the Security Agent notifying the Security Agent of the same;

in which case the Security Agent shall be entitled immediately to sell and transfer such Relevant Claim to
such purchaser (or an affiliate of such purchaser) and the consideration for such sale or transfer may be in
the form of non-cash consideration by way of the Senior Secured Creditors, Second Lien Creditors or
Topco Creditors (whichever constitutes the Instructing Group) bidding by an appropriate mechanic all or
part of the Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities (as applicable) such that
the relevant liabilities would on completion be discharged to the extent of an amount equal to the amount
of the offer made by the relevant creditors; and

(C) such sale or disposal (including any sale or disposal of any claim) is made:

(I) pursuant to a public auction or other competitive sale process run in accordance
with the advice of a reputable, independent and internationally recognised
investment bank, firm of accountants or third-party professional firm which is
regularly engaged in such sale processes with a view to obtaining the best price
reasonably obtainable taking into account all relevant circumstances and in which
creditors under the Second Lien Liabilities and Topco Liabilities are entitled to
participate as prospective buyers and/or financiers; or

265


-----

(II) where a reputable, independent and internationally recognised investment bank,
firm of accountants or third-party professional firm which is regularly engaged in
providing such valuations has delivered an opinion (including an enterprise
valuation of the Group which can be relied upon by the Security Agent (acting on
the instructions of the Instructing Group) and disclosed to the Senior Secured
Creditors, the Second Lien Creditors and the Topco Creditors on a non-reliance
basis) in respect of such sale or disposal that the amount is fair from a financial
point of view, taking into account all relevant circumstances including the method
of enforcement, _provided that the liability of such investment bank or_
internationally recognised firm of accountants or third-party professional firm in
giving such opinion may be limited to the amount of its fees in respect of such
engagement.

-----

**_Equalisation_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if, for any reason, any liabilities relating to Super Senior
Liabilities, Senior Secured Liabilities, Second Lien Liabilities or Topco Liabilities remain unpaid after the
first date on which certain types of Enforcement Action are taken (the "Enforcement Date") and the
resulting losses are not borne by the creditors in any given specified class in the proportions which their
respective exposures at the Enforcement Date bore to the aggregate exposures of all the creditors in that
specified class at the Enforcement Date, the relevant class of creditors will make such payments amongst
themselves as the Security Agent shall require to put the relevant creditors in such a position that (after
taking into account such payments) those losses are borne in those proportions. The enforceability of these
equalisation provisions is uncertain.

**_Required Consents_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that, subject to certain exceptions, its terms may be amended or
waived only with the consent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the agents and trustees for the Secured
Parties, and the Security Agent, provided that, to the extent an amendment, waiver or consent only affects
one class of creditors, and such amendment, waiver or consent could not reasonably be expected
materially or adversely to affect the interests of the other classes of creditors, only written agreement from
the relevant agent or trustee acting on behalf of the affected class (or, in the case of Hedge Counterparties,
each affected Hedge Counterparty) and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be required.

An amendment or waiver of the Intercreditor Agreement that has the effect of changing or which relates
to, among other matters, the provisions set out under "Application of Proceeds" above and the order of
priority or subordination under the Intercreditor Agreement shall not be made without the consent of each
of the agents or trustees (acting in accordance with the relevant finance documents) under the Senior
Liabilities, the Super Senior Liabilities, the Second Lien Liabilities and the Topco Liabilities, each Cash
Management Facility Lender (only to the extent the proposed amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Cash Management Facility Lender under the Intercreditor
Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class
of creditors), each Hedge Counterparty (only to the extent the proposed amendment or waiver would
materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of such Hedge Counterparty under the Intercreditor
Agreement and would not materially adversely affect the rights and obligations of any other creditor or class
of creditors), and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

Each agent or trustee shall, to the extent instructed to consent by the requisite percentage of creditors
it represents or as otherwise authorised by the Debt Documents to which it is party, act on such instructions
or authorisations in accordance therewith (save to the extent any amendments so consented or authorised
to relate to any provision affecting the personal rights and obligations of that agent or trustee in its capacity
as such).

_Amendments and Waivers: Transaction Security Documents_

Subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below), the Security
Agent may, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer consents: (i) amend the terms of, release or waive any of
the requirements of or grant consents under, any document creating Transaction Security or Topco
Independent Transaction Security which shall be binding on each party; (ii) (promptly upon request by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer) amend or release and retake any Transaction Security Documents or Topco
Independent Transaction Security Documents where such amendment or release and retake is required in
order to ensure the validity, perfection or priority of the Transaction Security purported to be created under
such Transaction Security Document or Topco Independent Transaction Security Documents, together
with any related or consequential waiver and any such amendment, release, waiver and retake shall be
binding on each party; and (iii) any amendment, release or waiver of, or consent under, any document
creating Transaction Security which would adversely affect the nature or scope of the assets subject to
Transaction Security or the manner in which the proceeds of enforcement of the Transaction Security or
Topco Independent Transaction Security are distributed, shall not be made without the consent of:

(i) each of the Agents (other than the agent in respect of any Cash Management Facility) acting
in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Finance Documents;

(ii) each Cash Management Facility Lender (or the relevant Cash Management Facility Agent on
its behalf, if appointed) but only to the extent such amendment or waiver would (i) materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of the Cash Management Facility lenders under the
Intercreditor Agreement in their capacity as such, and (ii) would not materially adversely affect
the rights and obligations of any Creditor or class of Creditors other than the Cash
Management Facility lenders (solely in their capacity as such);

268


-----

(iii) each Hedge Counterparty but only to the extent such amendment or waiver would materially
adversely affect the rights and obligations of the Hedge Counterparties under the Intercreditor
Agreement in their capacity as such, and would not materially adversely affect the rights and
obligations of any Creditor or class of Creditors other than the Hedge Counterparties (solely
in their capacity as such); and

(iv) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

_Exceptions_

Subject to the paragraph below, an amendment, waiver or consent which relates to the rights or
obligations which are personal to an agent, an arranger or the Security Agent in its capacity as such
(including, without limitation, any ability of that Security Agent to act in its discretion under the Intercreditor
Agreement) may not be effected without the consent of that agent, arranger or, as the case may be,
Security Agent.

The preceding paragraph and the first paragraph above under "Amendments and Waivers: Transaction
_Security Documents" are subject to certain exceptions under the Intercreditor Agreement, relating in_
particular to (i) any release of Transaction Security or Topco Independent Transaction Security, claim or
liabilities, or (ii) any amendment waiver or consent, which, in each case, the Security Agent gives in
accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the incurrence of additional or
refinancing debt or the provisions set out under "New Debt Financing," "Non-Distressed Disposals" and
"Distressed Disposals" above. Any release, amendment, waiver or consent effected in accordance with the
relevant provisions of the Debt Documents relating to such matters can be effected solely by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and the Security Agent.

_Snooze/Lose_

If in relation to a request for a consent, to participate in a vote of a class of creditors, to approve any
action or to provide any confirmation or notification, in each case, under the Intercreditor Agreement or any
other Debt Document which does not contain a snooze/lose provision substantially similar to that contained
in the Intercreditor Agreement, any Secured Creditor or Unsecured Creditor fails to respond to the request
within 10 business days (or any other period of time notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, with the
agreement of each of the agents or trustee in the case of a shorter period of time) of that request being
made or fails to provide details of its credit participation, such creditor will be disregarded and be deemed
to have zero participation in respect of the matter or be deemed to have provided the relevant confirmation
or notification, as applicable, provided that the foregoing shall not apply to any noteholder in respect of any
request where such noteholder is not given the option to respond to such request in the negative, but shall
otherwise apply to all noteholders.

_Provisions Following an IPO_

Following or in contemplation of an initial public offering of a member of the Group (or a holding company
thereof) (an "IPO"), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is entitled to require (by written notice to each Agent
and Hedge Counterparty) (a "Pushdown Notice") that the terms of the Debt Documents will automatically
operate so that, amongst other things, (i) the Group (and all related provisions) will now refer to the member
of the Group or holding company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer who will issue shares or whose shares
are to be sold pursuant to such IPO (the "IPO Pushdown Entity," and if (x) any Topco Notes are not
refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO, the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be any holding company
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer which is the issuer or borrower of any Topco Liabilities or (y) the Topco
Notes have been refinanced in full on or before the date of such IPO but the Senior Secured Notes have
not, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be the IPO Pushdown Entity) and its Restricted Subsidiaries,
(ii) all financial ratio calculations shall be made excluding any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity
and all reporting obligations shall be assumed at the level of the IPO Pushdown Entity, and (iii) certain
provisions of the Debt Documents (including representations, undertakings and events of default) will cease
to apply to any holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is entitled
to revoke its Pushdown Notice at any time prior to the occurrence of the relevant IPO Event. In the event
that any Pushdown Notice is revoked each of the changes specified in (i) to (iii) (inclusive) above shall no
longer apply.

Each holding company of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall be released from all obligations under the Debt
Documents (including any Transaction Security or, as the case may be, Topco Independent Transaction
Security) and each Subordinated Creditor, Third-Party Security Provider, Investor (as defined in the Senior
Facilities Agreement or any other Finance Document) or Topco Independent Obligor will be released from
its obligations and restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement in the appropriate capacity. In the event
that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer revokes its Pushdown Notice, the relevant member of the Group is
required (if instructed by an Instructing Group to (x) execute replacement Transaction Security or Topco

269


-----

Independent Transaction Security and (y) (by way of accession) accede to the Intercreditor Agreement in
the appropriate capacity.

Subject to the consent of the majority lenders under and as defined in the Senior Lender Liabilities,
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Senior Secured Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders
under and as defined in any Second Lien Facility Agreement, noteholders representing more than 50% of
any Second Lien Notes Liabilities, the majority lenders under and as defined in any Topco Facility and
noteholders representing more than 50% of any Topco Notes Liabilities (following the relevant IPO), each
subsidiary of the IPO Pushdown Entity shall also be released from all obligations as Debtor and guarantor
under the Debt Documents and from the Transaction Security (other than, in each case, borrowing
liabilities). Each party to the Intercreditor Agreement shall be required to enter into any amendment, release
or replacement of any Debt Document required to facilitate such matters.

_Agreement to Override_

Unless expressly stated otherwise therein, the Intercreditor Agreement overrides anything in any other
Debt Documents to the contrary.

**Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility**

On or before the Acquisition Completion Date, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will be
entered into by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, as borrower, Propco 1, Propco 2
and Bellis Noncore 1, as obligors, the lenders thereunder and Barclays Bank plc, as Agent (the
"Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility"), and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility
Borrower is expected to draw £950,000,000 under this facility on the Acquisition Completion Date to fund,
in part, the Equity Contribution. ASDA Group entities which own the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail
Assets and, to the extent applicable, Substitute Retail Assets, and hold Designated Bank Accounts, will be
third-party security providers under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.

Under the terms of the IEO, we will not be permitted to distribute any assets (including the Warehouse
Assets, the Select Retail Assets, the Substitute Retail Assets (to the extent applicable) and the balances
credited to the Designated Bank Accounts) until the Acquisition is approved by the CMA on the CMA
Clearance Date, and there can be no assurance that the CMA will approve the Acquisition. See "Risk
_Factors—Risk Factors Related to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties and_
_risks,_ _which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes." Following the CMA Clearance Date, the_
terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility require us to transfer the Warehouse Assets and
certain Select Retail Assets and, if required to replace any Affected Warehouses, one of more Substitute
Retail Assets with a value or aggregate value approximately equal to the value of the Affected
Warehouse(s) from the ASDA Group to Propco 2, an affiliate or the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility Borrower, which we intend to do by way of a transfer for consideration left outstanding, as described
in "The Transactions—The Post Completion Disposals." Certain Select Retail Assets and, as relevant,
Substitute Retail Assets may remain held by the ASDA Group but will continue to be charged in favour of
the Lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility as described in the paragraph below.
Following the date of completion of the Forecourt Business Disposal, (to the extent the Post-Completion
Disposals were made to Propco 2, rather than to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower,
following the CMA Clearance Date) the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will require
Midco 2 to transfer the entire share capital of Propco 1 to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility
Borrower, in consideration of repayment of the amounts then outstanding under the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility Proceeds Loan.

The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is guaranteed by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility Borrower, Propco 1, Propco 2 and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower's direct
parent entity, Bellis Noncore 1 Limited. The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is secured by (i) a
first-ranking pledge granted by Bellis Noncore 1 Limited over the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility
Borrower's share capital, (ii) a first ranking pledge granted by Propco 1 over Propco 2's share capital, (iii)
first-ranking security over the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower's rental account, (iv) firstranking security over Propco 2's rental account, (v) first-ranking mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable,
standard securities, over the Warehouse Assets and the Select Retail Assets and, if required to replace
any Affected Warehouses, one of more Substitute Retail Assets with a value or aggregate value
approximately equal to the value of the Affected Warehouse(s), (vi) a first ranking pledge granted by ASDA
entities over the Designated Bank Accounts (being the blocked accounts into which payments of rent under
the ASDA Leases in respect of Warehouse Assets and the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent
applicable, Substitute Retail Assets are prescribed to be made) and (vii) a first-ranking assignment granted
by each ASDA Propco over the proceeds of insurances, Rental Income (including any amount received
pursuant to any guarantee of Rental Income) and net property disposal proceeds. Prior to the PostCompletion Disposals, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility' lenders' recourse to the Issuers and

270


-----

the Restricted Subsidiaries will be limited to the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets, to the extent
required in the event that there is one or more Affected Warehouse, one or more Substitute Retail Assets,
and the Designated Bank Accounts, which will be mortgaged or charged (or the equivalent), as applicable,
for the exclusive benefit of these lenders and the other secured parties under the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility. After the Post-Completion Disposals, which will occur on or about the CMA
Clearance Date, the lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will have no recourse to
the Issuers, the Guarantors, any of the Issuers' Restricted Subsidiaries or any other Subsidiary of Topco
and their claims will be structurally subordinated to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. Upon transfer of
the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets, the balances credited to the Designated Bank Accounts
and, to the extent applicable, one or more Substitute Retail Assets to Propco 2 (or a relevant affiliate),
Propco 2 (or such affiliate) shall immediately grant first ranking legal mortgages (or, as applicable, fixed
charges or standard securities) over the Warehouses and Select Retail Assets and, to the extent
applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility Borrower (unless such assets are transferred to Propco 2 or any other relevant affiliate subject to
the mortgages (or, as applicable, standard securities) created by the Third-Party Asset Security). In
addition, monies held in the Designated Bank Accounts will be transferred to Propco 2's (or such affiliate's)
rental account in respect of which security will be granted to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.

The initial term of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is one year from the Acquisition
Completion Date, with the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower retaining an option to extend
it for a further six months at its sole discretion. The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has no
scheduled amortisation, and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower intends to repay it in
full ahead of maturity with the net proceeds from certain asset sales (primarily the Warehouse Sale
Transactions and, depending on market conditions and expected transaction values, sales of the Select
Retail Assets (subject to the ASDA Leases) and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the Substitute
Retail Assets (subject to the ASDA Leases)). The net proceeds of the sale of Warehouse Assets, Select
Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets, are required to be applied within
three business days of receipt of such proceeds in mandatory prepayment of the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility. We anticipate that the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower will
return to the Issuers or any of the Guarantors, by way of contribution to the equity, in-kind loan pursuant to
a deeply subordinated instrument or repayment of Post-Completion Disposal Receivables, any Select
Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, any Substitute Retail Assets that it does not sell, and (to the
extent not already applied in mandatory prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility) an
amount equal to any net proceeds from the sale of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable,
any Substitute Retail Assets (including any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds), in each case promptly after
the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has been discharged in full and, under the terms of the
Notes, the relevant Issuer is required to procure this contribution. See "Description of the Senior Secured
_Notes—Certain Covenants—Topco Covenant" and "Description of the Senior Notes—Certain_
_Covenants—Topco Covenant."_

Interest on the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will be payable in kind, and shall be treated
as increasing the principal amount of the loan in an amount equal to the accrued interest. The capitalised
and compounded interest will be paid together with the principal amount of the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility on maturity or upon prepayment. The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will have
no financial maintenance covenant and will contain such restrictive covenants as are customary in
syndicated real estate financings, broadly designed to preserve the value of the collateral.

The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility and any non-contractual obligations arising out of it are
governed by English law.

**Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility**

On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is expected to draw £750,000,000
under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, which will be used to fund a portion of the Transactions, as
set out in "Use of Proceeds."

The Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility will be guaranteed by each borrower and guarantor of the
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility. The Initial ASDA Guarantors and Post-Completion Guarantors shall
become guarantors under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and, subject to the Agreed Security
Principles and any applicable guarantee limitations, shall guarantee the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility
under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement and shall grant security (subject to the Agreed
Security Principles) in favour of the lenders under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement in
respect of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility.

271


-----

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles in the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement, the
following security is required to be granted as a condition precedent to the availability of the Forecourt
Disposal Bridge Facility on the Closing Date (as defined in the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility
Agreement): (a) the Senior Notes Issuer will grant a limited recourse share charge over the shares of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer; (b) the Senior Notes Issuer will grant a limited recourse assignment by way
of security over any material intra-group receivables owed to the Senior Notes Issuer by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer; and (c) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will grant a debenture comprising (i) assignment by
way of security of material intra-group receivables owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by any member
of the Group, (ii) security over the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's material bank accounts located in England
and Wales and (iii) floating charge over all or substantially all of its assets (other than customarily excluded
assets).

On the Acquisition Completion Date, the following security will also be granted: first-priority security
interests over (a) the issued share capital of the Initial ASDA Guarantors, (b) the material intercompany
receivables of the Initial ASDA Guarantors, not including the Post-Completion Disposal Receivables, (c)
the material bank accounts located in England and Wales of the Initial ASDA Guarantors, not including the
Designated Bank Accounts, and (d) a floating charge over all or substantially all of the assets (other than
any customarily excluded assets) of the Initial ASDA Guarantors.

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles in the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall procure that the Post-Completion Guarantors accede to the Forecourt
Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement as guarantors and procure delivery by the Post-Completion Guarantors
of certain conditions subsequent deliverables, consisting of (i) first-priority security interests over (a) all the
issued capital stock of each of the Post-Completion Guarantors, (b) the material intercompany receivables
of the Post-Completion Guarantors (not including the Post-Completion Disposal Receivables), and (c) the
material bank accounts (without control over use) located in England and Wales of the Post-Completion
Guarantors (not including the Designated Bank Accounts), and (ii) a floating charge over all or substantially
all assets of the Post-Completion Guarantors (other than customarily excluded assets). As a result of the
terms of the applicable "additional guarantees" covenant in the Forecourt Bridge Facility Agreement, it is
anticipated that such accession of guarantors and granting of security will occur on or about the time that
equivalent guarantees and security are granted by such persons under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

The initial term of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility is 364 days after the Acquisition Completion
Date. If the loans under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility have not been repaid in full on the initial
maturity date for the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the maturity date for such loans will be
automatically extended to the date that is 364 days after the initial maturity date. The Forecourt Disposal
Bridge Facility has no scheduled amortisation. The Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility incorporates
mandatory prepayment provisions, including a provision whereby net cash proceeds of the disposition of
certain forecourt assets shall be applied in prepayment of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility in priority
to certain other indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. It also includes a mandatory prepayment
requirement for dispositions of any real estate assets or operating sites that yield net cash proceeds (in a
single transaction or series of related transactions) in excess of £35 million, but proceeds from sale and
leaseback transactions (other than such transactions in respect of forecourt assets) that are not in excess
of £35 million are not subject to mandatory prepayment provisions. The Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility
is expected to be replaced and/or refinanced with the proceeds from the sale to EG Group of certain of the
Forecourt Assets of the ASDA Group and from the sale of Excluded Forecourts to unaffiliated third parties
(if required). However, under the terms of the IEO, we will not be permitted to consummate the Forecourt
Business Disposal or any Excluded Forecourt Divestments until the Acquisition is approved by the CMA
on the CMA Clearance Date, and there can be no assurance that the CMA will approve the Acquisition.
See "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain
_uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes."_

Subject to the Agreed Security Principles in the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement, on or
before the date falling 180 days after the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
shall procure delivery by the ASDA Guarantors of certain conditions subsequent deliverables, consisting
of first-priority security interests over Material Real Property (as such term is defined in the Forecourt
Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement, which excludes the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and
the Substitute Retail Assets) situated in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland pursuant to the
terms of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement.

Security granted by the obligors shall, pursuant to the Agreed Security Principles, be limited to security
over such obligor's (a) material bank accounts (without control over use) located in a Security Jurisdiction,
(b) shares owned by such obligor in other Material Subsidiaries (as defined in the Forecourt Disposal Bridge
Facility Agreement) which are Guarantors, (c) material intercompany receivables owed to such obligor by
other members of the Group, (d) Material Real Property (as defined in the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility

272


-----

Agreement) owned by such obligor (by way of mortgage or, as applicable, standard security) and (e) all
asset floating charge security (other than customarily excluded assets) to the extent it is customary to grant
such security in the jurisdiction of incorporation of such obligor, provided that no other security shall be
required to be given by any other member of the Group or in relation to any other asset unless specifically
otherwise requested or agreed to by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in its absolute discretion) provided
further that limited recourse third-party share security over the shares in Material Subsidiaries (as defined
in the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement) shall be granted by the direct holding companies of
such Material Subsidiaries (as defined in the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement).

Interest on the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility is based on LIBOR (subject to a 0.00% floor) plus an
agreed margin, is subject to step-ups at certain intervals (subject to an agreed cap) and is payable in cash
on the last day of each quarterly interest period and on the applicable maturity date. Interest on the
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility will be payable quarterly in arrears and computed on the basis of a 365day year or where the practice in the Relevant Interbank Market (as defined in the Forecourt Disposal
Bridge Facility Agreement) differs, in accordance with that market practice. There is no financial
maintenance covenant in the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility; it contains restrictive and incurrence
covenants that are substantially consistent with the Senior Facilities Agreement, with certain additional
limitations on restricted payments and there is an additional "additional guarantees" covenant. The
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement also contains additional positive covenants relating to: (i)
authorisations and consents, (ii) compliance with laws, (iii) pari passu ranking, (iv) requirement to deliver
copies of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's audited annual consolidated financial statements to the Agent
(as defined in the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement) within 120 days after the end of each of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's fiscal years (or 150 days after the end of the fiscal year ending December
31, 2021) and (v) requirement to deliver the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's consolidated financial
statements within 60 days of the end of each of its first three fiscal quarters in each fiscal year (or 90 days
in respect of the first three fiscal quarters ending after the Acquisition Completion Date).

The Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement provides for substantially the same events of default
as under the Senior Secured Notes. In addition, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement provides
for additional events of default, subject to customary materiality qualifications and grace periods, including
(i) inaccuracy of a representation or statement when made, (ii) invalidity and unlawfulness of the Finance
Documents (as defined in the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement) and (iii) material breach of
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and any non-contractual obligations arising out of it are governed
by English law, except that certain covenants and events of default and related definitions will be interpreted
in accordance with New York law.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES**

_You will find definitions of certain capitalised terms used in this "Description of the Senior Secured_
_Notes" under the heading "Certain Definitions." For purposes of this "Description of the Senior Secured_
_Notes," references to the "Senior Secured Notes Issuer," "we," "our," and "us" refer only to Bellis_
_Acquisition Company plc and not to any of its Subsidiaries._

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue £2,250 million aggregate principal amount of sterlingdenominated % Senior Secured Notes due 2026 (the "Senior Secured Notes") under an
indenture, to be dated as of, 2021 (the "Senior Secured Notes Indenture"), between,
_inter alios, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee (the_
"Trustee"), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the "Security Agent"), Deutsche Bank
AG, London Branch, as paying agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as transfer agent (the
"Transfer Agent") and registrar (the "Registrar"), in a private transaction that is not subject to the
registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be qualified
under, incorporate by reference or include terms of, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the U.S. Trust
Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. £2,250 million in
aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes will be issued in this offering. We may, subject to
applicable law, issue an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Secured Notes (the "Additional
**Senior Secured Notes") of the same or different series as the Senior Secured Notes initially issued on**
the Issue Date, which shall have substantially identical terms to the initial Senior Secured Notes, except
for certain terms which may be specifically distinguished in an Officer's Certificate; provided that if the
Additional Senior Secured Notes are not fungible with the Senior Secured Notes for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, the Additional Senior Secured Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN code, Common
Code or other securities identification number, as applicable, from the Senior Secured Notes. We will only
be permitted to issue Additional Senior Secured Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and
the Incurrence of Liens (as described below under "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness"
and "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens"). Except with respect to right of payment and optional
redemption, and as otherwise provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured
Notes issued in this Offering and, if issued, any Additional Senior Secured Notes will be treated as a single
class for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect
to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in
this "Description of the Senior Secured Notes," references to the "Senior Secured Notes" include the Senior
Secured Notes and any Additional Senior Secured Notes that are actually issued.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are
important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Senior Secured Notes and the Liens on the
Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes. Please see "Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement" for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor_
Agreement.

The registered Holder of a Senior Secured Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only
registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation,
with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Secured Notes have not been,
and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

This "Description of the Senior Secured Notes" is intended to be an overview of the material provisions
of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this
description of the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents for complete descriptions
of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are
available from us upon request, and following the Issue Date, copies of such documents will be made
available upon request to holders of Senior Secured Notes, as described in more detail under "Listing and
_General Information."_

**Acquisition Agreement; Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds**

Pursuant to the acquisition agreement dated October 2, 2020 (the "Acquisition Agreement") between
Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited, an indirect subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer formed for
the purpose of facilitating the Transactions (the "Purchaser"), and ASDA Holdings UK Limited, the
Purchaser agreed to acquire all of the issued ordinary shares of the Company.

We intend to settle the Offering on            (the "Issue Date"), which we currently expect to be
after the date of consummation of the Acquisition (the "Completion Date"). In this case, on the Completion
Date, the Issuers are expected to draw £700 million (equivalent) in loans under the Senior Bridge Facility
and £1,400 million (equivalent) in loans under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, to fund part of the
consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement. On the Issue Date, we will then use the proceeds
of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes together with the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes
to repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Bridge Facility and the Senior Secured Bridge
Facilities. See "Use of Proceeds." In this case, on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be
obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company
and ASDA Stores Limited (the "Initial Guarantors").

It is, however, possible that the Completion Date may be delayed until after the Issue Date, including
due to the timing of our receipt of the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. In this case, unless the Offering is
completed substantially concurrently with the Completion Date, we will fund the gross proceeds of the
Offering into escrow, as further described below and, on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be
obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer only and will not be guaranteed on a senior basis by the
Initial Guarantors until the Completion Date. In such circumstances, the Company and its Subsidiaries will
continue to be controlled by Walmart prior the Completion Date. We cannot assure you that Walmart will
operate ASDA's business during the interim period in the same way that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
would and we cannot assure you that, following the Completion Date, the Company will operate its
business in the same way that Walmart has operated the business in the past. As such, we cannot assure
you that, prior to the Completion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that
would otherwise have been prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, had those covenants been
applicable to such entities after the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date.

If this Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the Acquisition, we will forego the escrow
procedures described above and will instead retain the proceeds of the Offering to fund part of the
consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement on the Completion Date. See "Use of Proceeds."

In any event, as contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition will be completed during
the pendency of the review of the Acquisition by the CMA, and the CMA's review remains ongoing. In
connection with its review of the Acquisition, the CMA is expected to issue an IEO, which we expect to
remain in force until the CMA Clearance Date. Under this IEO, neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
nor any Parent will be permitted to exercise control over the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise
direct their operations until the CMA Clearance Date. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and
its Parents will not be able to direct the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply with the covenants
described in this "Description of the Senior Secured Notes" until the CMA Clearance Date, and the
Company and its material subsidiaries will have no contractual obligation to comply with these covenants
until each of these entities accedes to Senior Secured Notes Indenture on the applicable date, which will
be on or after the Completion Date. Nevertheless, the covenants described herein will apply to the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries from the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date, and
any failure to comply with these covenants will constitute a Default under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption_

If the Offering is consummated prior to, and not substantially concurrently with or after, the Completion
Date, the Initial Purchasers will deposit, on the Issue Date, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds
of this offering and sale of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date into one or more escrow accounts
(such proceeds, the "Escrowed Proceeds" and such accounts, collectively, the "Escrow Accounts")
pursuant to the terms of one or more escrow agreements (each an "Escrow Agreement" and together,
the "Escrow Agreements") to be dated as of the Issue Date among the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the
Trustee and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (in such capacity, the "Escrow Agent").

The Escrowed Proceeds deposited in each of the Escrow Accounts will be held in the name of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer, but will be controlled by the Escrow Agent. The Escrowed Proceeds, and
all other funds and payments credited to the Escrow Accounts (less any property and/or funds released
in accordance with each Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the "Escrowed Property."
The Senior Secured Notes Issuer's rights with respect to the Escrow Accounts, together with the

275


-----

Escrowed Property, will be pledged in favour of the Trustee on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Holders
of Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date (such charges to be documented under one or more English
law governed security agreements (the "Escrow Account Charges") among the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and the Trustee to be dated on or before the Issue Date).

Under the terms of the Escrow Agreements, amounts may be released from the Escrow Accounts prior
to the Completion Date to pay accrued interest on the Senior Secured Notes on any interest payment
date in respect thereof occurring prior to the Escrow Release Date.

Each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted
the terms and conditions of the applicable Escrow Agreement or Escrow Agreements, as applicable, and
the Escrow Account Charges and to have irrevocably authorised and directed the Trustee and the Escrow
Agent to take all actions set forth in the Escrow Agreements in the event it is executed without the need
for further direction from them under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Changes or other modifications
to the Escrow Agreements and the Escrow Account Charges can be made either with the consent of
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of Senior Secured
Notes then outstanding or without the consent of Holders, if such changes or other modifications will not,
individually or when taken as whole, adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect.

_Release of Escrowed Proceeds in connection with the consummation of Acquisition_

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to, or to pay it at the instruction
of, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the "Release"), the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have
received from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, at a time that is on or before April 30, 2022 (the "Outside
**Date"), an Officer's Certificate pursuant to each Escrow Agreement, upon which both the Escrow Agent**
and the Trustee shall conclusively rely, without further investigation or verification, certifying that (i) as of
the date of delivery of such Officer's Certificate, there is no Event of Default under clause (5) of the first
paragraph under the heading titled "Events of Default" with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
and (ii) the Acquisition has been consummated or will be consummated reasonably promptly, and in no
event later than three Business Days, following the Release, in accordance with the terms of the
Acquisition Agreement as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum, except for any changes or
other modifications to such terms to which the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding have consented or that will not, individually or when taken
as whole, have a materially adverse effect on the Holders.

Under the terms of each Escrow Agreement, the Release shall occur promptly upon the satisfaction
of the conditions set forth above (the date of such satisfaction, the "Escrow Release Date"). Upon any
such Release, the balance of the Escrow Accounts shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property
shall be released in accordance with each Escrow Agreement. Receipt by the Trustee of such Officer's
Certificate shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee to the release of the Escrowed Property from
the charges documented under the Escrow Account Charges.

_Special Mandatory Redemption_

Pursuant to one or more shortfall agreements (the "Shortfall Agreements") to be entered into on or
prior to the Issue Date between the Issuers and Bellis Midco Limited ("Midco"), a wholly-owned subsidiary
of Topco and a Holding Company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer, Midco
will be required to contribute to the Escrow Accounts and the corresponding escrow accounts for the
Senior Notes, up to the maximum aggregate amount of £20.0 million, an amount in cash expected to
equal the sum of (i) interest accrued on the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes from the Issue
Date, and (ii) any Additional Amounts or corresponding additional amounts for the Senior Notes, in each
case, to March 31, 2021 (the "Shortfall Agreement Termination Date"), which is the date by which we
expect to have received the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. A bank of international standing (the
"Issuing Bank") will guarantee Midco's obligations under the Shortfall Agreements by delivering to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer, on the Issue Date, an irrevocable letter of
credit or on demand guarantee (the "On-Demand Guarantee") expiring on March 31, 2021. Pursuant to
the On-Demand Guarantee, each of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer will be
entitled to draw funds from the Issuing Bank to make up the relevant escrow shortfall, upon request made
no later than March 31, 2021 and up to the maximum aggregate amount of £20.0 million. If the Acquisition
and the Release have not occurred by March 31, 2021, Midco shall be entitled to extend the Shortfall
Agreement Termination Date unilaterally, at its discretion, by procuring that all of the following actions
take place: (a) Midco shall have increased its commitment to contribute cash to the Escrow Accounts and
the corresponding escrow accounts for the Senior Notes under the Shortfall Agreements to an amount
expected to equal the sum of (i) interest accrued on the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes from
April 1, 2021, and (ii) any Additional Amounts or corresponding additional amounts for the Senior Notes,

276


-----

in each case, to a date chosen by Midco that is not later than the Outside Date, (b) the Issuing Bank shall
have increased its original commitment under the On-Demand Guarantee by the same amount set forth
in clause (a), and (c) the expiry date of the On-Demand Guarantee shall have been extended to, and be
the same as, the extended Shortfall Termination Date. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will promptly
deliver notice of any extension of the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date to the Trustee and the Escrow
Agent, confirming that all actions described in the preceding clauses (a), (b) and (c) have been completed.
Midco may decide to extend the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date on one or more occasions, at its
discretion, up to (but no later than) the Outside Date under the Escrow Agreement. The Shortfall
Agreements will terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the Release.

In the event that (a) the Escrow Release Date does not take place on or prior to the Outside Date, (b)
in the reasonable judgment of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated
by the Outside Date, (c) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Outside Date,
(d) an Event of Default arises under clause (5) of the first paragraph under "—Events of Default" on or
prior to the Outside Date with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or (e) the Shortfall Agreement
Termination Date occurs on or prior to the Outside Date and at a time when the Escrow Release Date
has not yet taken place (the date of any such event being the "Special Termination Date"), the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes (the "Special Mandatory
**Redemption") at a price equal to 100% of their respective aggregate issue price, plus accrued but unpaid**
interest from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) (subject to
the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) and Additional Amounts, if any (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Price").

If a Special Termination Date occurs, notices of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent no later than two Business Days
following such date, and these notices will provide that the Senior Secured Notes shall be redeemed on
a date that is no later than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreements (the "Special Mandatory Redemption
**Date"). Provided that the Escrow Accounts are sufficiently funded, on a Special Mandatory Redemption**
Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory
Redemption Price for such Holder's Senior Secured Notes and, substantially concurrently with the
payment to such Holders, deliver any excess Escrowed Property to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

**General**

_The Senior Secured Notes_

The Senior Secured Notes will:

     - be general senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, secured as set forth under
"—Security";

     - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior
Secured Notes, including the Senior Credit Facilities and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge
Facility;

     - rank senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes, including the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer's Guarantee of the Senior Notes;

     - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation (including
obligations to trade creditors) of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries that is
secured by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Secured Notes (including the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility for so long as the Warehouse Assets, Select Retail
Assets and Substitute Retail Assets are held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its
Subsidiaries, and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, for so long as any Forecourt Disposal
Receivable is held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries) to the extent of the
value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness only;

     - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer that are not Guarantors, including their obligations to trade
creditors; and

     - be guaranteed, on the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date, on a senior basis by
the Initial Guarantors, and within 90 days of the Completion Date, on a senior basis by the
Post-Completion Guarantors, in each case, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the

277


-----

limitations described herein and in "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure,
_Our Financing and Our Indebtedness — Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be_
_subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject_
_to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability" and "Certain Insolvency_
_Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests."_

Under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes will receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral on a pari passu basis with all Indebtedness that is secured
on an equal and ratable basis with the Senior Secured Notes, including obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and certain Hedging Obligations, and in priority
to any Indebtedness that is secured on a junior basis to the Senior Secured Notes, including, with respect
to Shared Security, obligations under the Senior Notes; _provided, however, that under certain_
circumstances, certain Indebtedness and Hedging Obligations may be re-designated as "super senior"
obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive
proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the obligations thereunder have been paid in full. See
"—Security—Priority," "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement" and "—Certain
_Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens."_

_The Notes Guarantees_

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and, on the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date, will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the
Initial Guarantors, subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will
provide that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required to
cause each of the Post-Completion Guarantors to guarantee the Senior Secured Notes on a senior basis
prior to the date falling 90 days after the Completion Date. In addition, if required by the covenant described
under "—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees," certain other Restricted Subsidiaries may
provide a Notes Guarantee in the future.

Each Notes Guarantee will:

     - be a general senior obligation of the applicable Guarantor, secured as set forth under
"—Security";

     - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing or future Indebtedness of the applicable
Guarantor that is not subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Notes Guarantee,
including that Guarantor's obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities and the Forecourt
Disposal Bridge Facility;

     - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of the applicable
Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Notes
Guarantee, including that Guarantor's Guarantee of the Senior Notes;

     - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the
applicable Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes
Guarantee (including the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility for so long as the
Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets are held by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries, and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, for so
long as any Forecourt Disposal Receivable is held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its
Subsidiaries) to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness
or obligation only;

     - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the
Subsidiaries of the applicable Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including their obligations
to trade creditors; and

     - be subject to the limitations described herein and in "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
_Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—Each Notes Guarantee and security_
_interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_law or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability" and "Certain_
_Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests."_

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Notes Guarantees
to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit,
fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and

278


-----

their respective shareholders, directors and general partners, and as further stipulated in the Agreed
Security Principles. For a description of such contractual limitations, see "Certain Insolvency
_Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests." By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be_
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. See also "Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—The insolvency laws of_
_England and Wales and other jurisdictions may not be as favourable to you as the_ _U.S. bankruptcy laws_
_and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes." Prior to the CMA_
Clearance Date, the CMA will have broad authority to maintain separation between the ASDA Group and
the Bellis Group, which could negatively affect the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees provided by the
ASDA Guarantors. See "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to the Transactions—The Acquisition is
_subject to certain uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes."_

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries; Extraction of Warehouse Assets, Select**
**Retail Assets, balances credited to Designated Bank Accounts and, to the extent required,**
**Substitute Retail Assets**

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be "Restricted Subsidiaries" for purposes of the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under _"—Certain_
_Definitions—Unrestricted Subsidiary," we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as_
"Unrestricted Subsidiaries." Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

On the Completion Date, entities within the ASDA Group entered into the ASDA Leases and granted
first-ranking mortgages, fixed charges or standard securities, as applicable, over certain Warehouse
Assets and Select Retail Assets and, to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility, certain Substitute Retail Assets, as well as first-ranking pledges over the Designated Bank
Accounts, in each case, to secure the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower's obligations
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. None of the lenders or the other secured parties
under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, the Senior Bridge Facility, the Senior Credit Facilities or the
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility benefit from any security interest in the Warehouse Assets, the Select
Retail Assets, the Substitute Retail Assets or the Designated Bank Accounts, and these assets will not be
pledged as collateral for the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes.

Following receipt of all regulatory approvals in connection with the Acquisition, the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture will allow us to transfer the Warehouse Assets, balances credited to the Designated Bank
Accounts and, to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, the
Select Retail Assets and the Substitute Retail Assets to one or more Parents, in exchange for no
consideration or for consideration left outstanding in the form of one or more vendor loans. Upon
completion of the respective Post-Completion Disposals, the relevant assets will no longer be deemed
"Warehouse Assets," "Select Retail Assets" or "Substitute Retail Assets" under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture except in connection with the determination of what property constitutes "Material Real Property"
and, in the case of assets that constituted Select Retail Assets or Substitute Retail Assets (as applicable)
immediately prior to completion of the relevant Post-Completion Disposal, for purposes of the covenant
described under "Certain Covenants—Topco Covenant." Upon the completion of any Retail Assets
Contribution, the asset (or related Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds, as applicable) that is the subject of such
Retail Assets Contribution will no longer be deemed a "Select Retail Asset" or "Substitute Retail Asset" (as
applicable) under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (other than in connection with the determination of
what property constitutes "Material Real Property"). See "Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements―Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility" for a description of the Distribution Asset_
Disposal Bridge Facility.

The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower intends to repay the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility primarily with the net proceeds from either sales of the Warehouse Assets subject to the
ASDA Leases or sale and leaseback transactions involving the Warehouse Assets. Depending on market
conditions and expected transaction values, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower may
also sell subject to the ASDA Leases or sell and lease back some or all of the Select Retail Assets and
Substitute Retail Assets, the net proceeds of which will also be applied to repay the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to procure the return, by way of
contribution to its equity, Subordinated Shareholder Funding or repayment of Post-Completion Disposal
Receivables held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, of any assets
that constituted Select Retail Assets or Substitute Retail Assets at the time of their distribution that are not
sold by obligors under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility (whether by way of sales subject to
the ASDA Leases, sale and leaseback transactions or otherwise) and an amount equal to any Net Available

Cash from the sale of such assets (including any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds) that have not been
applied to repay or prepay the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, in each case, promptly after the
Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has been discharged in full. See "―Certain Covenants―Topco
_Covenant." For the avoidance of doubt, upon the contribution (including in the form of Subordinated_
Shareholder Funding) or transfer to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries,
as applicable) pursuant to a Retail Assets Contribution of assets that, at the time of their distribution
pursuant to a Post-Completion Disposal, constituted Select Retail Assets or Substitute Retail Assets, such
assets will cease to be Select Retail Assets or Substitute Retail Assets (as applicable) and shall be fully
subject to the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior
Facilities Agreement and (if any loans are outstanding under such facility) the Forecourt Disposal Bridge
Facility Agreement, in the same way as any other assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries, except that such assets will remain excluded from the definition of "Material Real
Property."

**Principal and Maturity**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will issue £2,250 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes on the Issue Date. The Senior Secured Notes will mature on    , 2026. The Senior
Secured Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in
excess thereof.

**Interest**

Interest on the Senior Secured Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Senior
Secured Notes will:

     - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most
recently paid;

     - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on and, commencing on       ;

     - be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Secured Notes on the Business Day
immediately preceding the related interest payment date (for Senior Secured Notes held in
global form); and

     - be computed on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 365-day year. The interest amount will
be calculated by applying the applicable rate of interest to the aggregate principal amount
outstanding under the Senior Secured Notes.

Each interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant payment date.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Senior Secured Notes are subject to
applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Secured Notes**

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Senior Secured Notes (as
defined below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided
that all such payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes represented by one or more Global Senior
Secured Note registered in the name of or held by a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts if any, on any certificated securities, which shall
be in registered form for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("Definitive Registered Notes") will be payable
at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition,
interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by bank transfer to the person entitled thereto as
shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See "—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer
_Agent for the Senior Secured Notes."_

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Secured Notes is not a Business Day at the
place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the
amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further
interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

280


-----

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Secured Notes**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Secured
Notes. The initial Paying Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the "Principal Paying Agent"
or "Paying Agent").

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the "Registrar") and a transfer agent
(the "Transfer Agent"). The initial Registrar and Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A.
The Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership
of the Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and, together with the Transfer
Agent, will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for
the Senior Secured Notes without prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the
Senior Secured Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and, on the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date, will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the
Initial Guarantors, subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will
provide that, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required to
cause each of McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood House Group Limited (the "Post**Completion Guarantors" and, together with the Initial Guarantors, the "ASDA Guarantors") to guarantee**
the Senior Secured Notes on a senior basis prior to the date falling 90 days after the Completion Date. As
of October 20, 2020, the ASDA Guarantors held title to sites representing 99.9% of the aggregate capital
pricing of the ASDA Store and Office Portfolio, as described in "Brokers' Opinions of Pricing." For the nine
month period ended September 30, 2020, the ASDA Guarantors represented 99.9% of the Company's
consolidated revenue.

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Notes Guarantees
to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit,
fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective
shareholders, directors and general partners, and as further stipulated in the Agreed Security Principles.
For a description of such contractual limitations, see "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital
_Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—The insolvency laws of England and Wales and other_
_jurisdictions may not be as favourable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the_
_Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes," "—Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will_
_be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain_
_defences that may limit its validity and enforceability," and "Certain Insolvency Considerations and_
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_ _Security Interests."_

The operations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are and will be conducted through its Subsidiaries.
Claims of creditors of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the
Guarantors, including Holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Secured Notes and each Notes
Guarantee therefore will be structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred
and minority stockholders (if any) of Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (other than such
Subsidiaries that are Guarantors). Although the Senior Secured Notes Indenture limits the Incurrence of
Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries, the limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions.
Moreover, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not impose any limitation on the Incurrence by
Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered Indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. See "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Indebtedness" and_ _"—Certain Definitions—_
_Indebtedness."_

In addition, as described below under "—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees" and
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that
guarantees any Indebtedness Incurred under any Syndicated Term Facilities, any other Credit Facility that
provides for aggregate lending commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination
or any Public Debt shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Secured
Notes.

281


-----

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favour of obligations
under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes and the Forecourt Disposal
Bridge Facility. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where,
among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or
requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference rules, "thin capitalisation"
rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, where the time and cost of
granting the guarantee or security would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders or where
security would be granted over the Capital Stock, liabilities, property or other assets of any member of the
Regulated Group.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor's
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise stipulated under the
Agreed Security Principles, including to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws.
By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less
than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no
obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our
_Financing and Our Indebtedness—Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain_
_limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defences that_ _may_
_limit its validity and enforceability," "—The insolvency laws of England and Wales and other jurisdictions_
_may not be as favourable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from_
_recovering payments due on the Notes" and "Certain Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity_
_and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests."_

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock
of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition
of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of the Guarantor as
an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon becoming a member of the Regulated Group;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes
or upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, as provided in "—Defeasance" and "—Satisfaction and Discharge";

(5) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged
from its liability with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities and (ii) does not guarantee any Syndicated Term
Facility or any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending commitments in excess of £50.0
million at the relevant date of determination or Public Debt;

(6) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including as
described under "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions
_Following an IPO");_

(7) as described under "—Amendments and Waivers";

(8) as described in the first paragraph of the covenant described below under "—Certain
_Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees";_

(9) as a result of a transaction permitted by "—Certain Covenants—Merger and _Consolidation—The_
_Guarantors"; or_

(10) in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation.

Upon the request of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all
reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the
releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, upon
receipt of customary documentation under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and without the consent of
the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

282


-----

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Secured Notes will be issued in global registered form without interest coupons, as follows:

     - Senior Secured Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant
to Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes
in registered form without interest coupons attached (the "144A Global Senior Secured
**Notes"). The 144A Global Senior Secured Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with**
and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of
Euroclear and Clearstream.

     - Senior Secured Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the
Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes" and,
together with the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes, the "Global Senior Secured **Notes").**
The Regulation S Global Senior Secured Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and
registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear
and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Senior Secured Notes ("Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to
persons that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through
such participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarised below and described more fully under "Notice to
_Investors." In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants_
in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and
subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their
respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Senior Secured Notes (the "144A Book-Entry Interests") may
be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global
Senior Secured Notes (the "Regulation S **Book-Entry Interests") only upon delivery by the transferor of**
a written certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
144A Senior Secured Notes Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is
being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the
meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with any
applicable state securities laws.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Note from which it was
transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Secured Note to which it was
transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if
any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Senior Secured Note to which
it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
£100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar
of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions
received by Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant BookEntry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as
set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer in compliance with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the
restrictions on transfer summarised below and described more fully under "Notice to Investors."

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Secured Notes issued as Definitive
Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of
£100,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any
such transfer or exchange, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging
holder to, among other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish
information regarding the account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to
furnish certain certificates and opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or

283


-----

exchange. Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes
payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of Senior Secured Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior Secured
Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment date
(which will be 15 days prior to the relevant interest date for Senior Secured Notes held in
definitive registered form); or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar
will be entitled to treat the Holders of Senior Secured Notes as the owners thereof for all purposes.

**Security**

_General_

If this Offering is settled prior to, and not substantially concurrently with or after, the Completion Date,
the gross proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes will be deposited into the Escrow Accounts
and the Senior Secured Notes will be secured by the Escrow Account Charges on the Issue Date.

On the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
Senior Secured Notes will be secured by first-priority security interests over (a) the issued share capital of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the "Issuer Share Collateral") and each of the Initial Guarantors, (b)
the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan and any other material intra-group receivables owing to the Senior
Notes Issuer by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, (c) the material intercompany receivables owing to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Initial Guarantors by the other members of the Group, not including
the Post-Completion Disposal Receivables, (d) the material bank accounts located in England and Wales
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Initial Guarantors, not including the Designated Bank Accounts,
and (e) a floating charge over all or substantially all of the assets (other than customarily excluded assets)
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Initial Guarantors, including the Forecourt Disposal Receivable,
as and when created (collectively, the "Completion Date Collateral").

The Senior Secured Notes will be further secured, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, certain
perfection requirements and any Permitted Collateral Liens, by security interests granted on an equal and
ratable first-priority basis over the following property, rights and assets:

(a) within 90 days of the Completion Date:

(1) all the issued Capital Stock of each of the Post-Completion Guarantors;

(2) the material intercompany receivables owing to the Post-Completion Guarantors by other
members of the Group, not including the Post-Completion Disposal Receivables;

(3) the material bank accounts located in England and Wales of the Post-Completion
Guarantors, not including the Designated Bank Accounts; and

(4) a floating charge over all or substantially all of the assets of the Post-Completion
Guarantors (other than customarily excluded assets); and

(b) within 180 days of the Completion Date, such freehold property as constitutes Material Real
Property based on the ASDA Store and Office Portfolio and related capital pricing set forth in the Brokers'
Opinions of Pricing described in this Offering Memorandum;

in each case, excluding the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets, the Designated Bank
Accounts, the Substitute Retail Assets and the Post-Completion Disposal Receivables (collectively, the
"Post-Completion Collateral" and, together with the Completion Date Collateral, the "Collateral").

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall take such necessary actions and shall cause its Restricted
Subsidiaries to take such necessary actions so that the Post-Completion Collateral shall be, to the extent
legally possible and subject to the Agreed Security Principles, confirmed no later than the date that is 90
days after the Completion Date and, in the case of Material Real Property, confirmed no later than the date
that is 180 days after the Completion Date.

284


-----

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under "—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest" and "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens," the Senior_
Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral
in connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries,
including any Additional Senior Secured Notes issued by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as permitted
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See "Risk Factors—Risks
_Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness."_

Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior
Secured Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture would also constitute
"Collateral." All Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any
Permitted Collateral Liens.

As described above, all of the Collateral will also secure the liabilities under the Senior Credit Facilities,
including the Revolving Credit Facilities and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, as well as certain
Hedging Obligations, and may also secure certain future indebtedness, including any Additional Senior
Secured Notes. Additionally, the Issuer Share Collateral, the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan and any
other material intra-group receivables owing to the Senior Notes Issuer by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
(collectively, the "Shared Security") will also secure the Senior Notes Issuer's obligations under the Senior
Notes on a second priority basis. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient
to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes.

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Senior Secured
Notes, with the exception of the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing described in this Offering Memorandum. By
its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See "Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Senior Secured Notes—The Senior Secured Notes Collateral may not be sufficient to_
_secure the obligations under the Senior Secured Notes." Under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes_
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, no security interest will be granted to secure the Senior Secured
Notes in either the assets or the issued Capital Stock of any Subsidiary that is or becomes part of our
Regulated Group, and no Security Interests may be granted over any intercompany receivables owed by
or to members of the Regulated Group to or by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary. Prior to the CMA Clearance Date, the CMA will have broad authority to maintain separation
between the ASDA Group and the Bellis Group, which could affect the enforcement of the Collateral. See
"Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain
_uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes."_

_Priority_

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the "Security Interests") as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement,
(b) the lenders under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, (c) the counterparties under certain Hedging
Obligations, (d) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and (e) the trustee, the Security Agent and the holders of the Senior Notes
under the Senior Notes Indenture, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the Additional Intercreditor Agreements (if
any) and the security documents relating to the Senior Facilities Agreement and such Hedging Obligations.
Such documents provide, among other things, that under certain circumstances, including a repayment in
full of the amounts outstanding under term facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations and certain
other Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super priority basis may be re-designated as "super
senior" obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only
receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the obligations under such other
Indebtedness have been paid in full. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement" and "—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens." In addition, pursuant to the_
Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreements (if any) entered into after the Issue Date,
the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See "—Release of Liens," "—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest" and "—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens."_

In addition, the Shared Security will also secure the Senior Notes on a second-priority basis.

_Enforcement of Security Interests_

The Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Trustee or the Holders of Senior Secured
Notes to enforce the Security Interests and will provide for the release of the Security Interests created by
the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance

285


-----

with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement" and "Certain Insolvency Considerations and_
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests." The ability_
to enforce the Security Interests may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future
Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and
the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will provide) for
circumstances in which the Holders of the Senior Notes may instruct the Security Agent to take
enforcement action in respect of such Security Interests including if, among other things, a default under
the Senior Notes is continuing following the expiry of a Senior Notes enforcement standstill period (being
a period of up to 179 days), provided that (other than in the case of an event of default which has occurred
under the Senior Notes as a result of failure to pay principal at final maturity) no such enforcement action
may be taken against a debtor or any of its subsidiaries if enforcement action is being taken by the Security
Agent against that debtor in respect of Shared Security on the instructions of an instructing group which
the proposed Senior Notes enforcement action might reasonably be expected to adversely affect.

_Agreed Security Principles_

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of Notes Guarantees and security in favour of
obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and are substantially similar to the agreed security principles
appended to the Senior Facilities Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the
granting of Notes Guarantees and security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by
general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit
rules, fraudulent preference rules, "thin capitalisation" rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title
claims and similar matters, where the time and cost of granting the guarantee or security would be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders or where security would be granted over the Capital
Stock, property or other assets, or liabilities of a member of the Regulated Group.

In this "Agreed Security Principles" section only, any reference to "Acquired Person **or** **Asset,"**
"Agent," "Debtor," "Finance Document," "Secured Debt Document," or "Secured Parties" is a
reference to that term as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date. See
"Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement."

General Principles

The guarantees and security required to be provided under the Secured Debt Documents will be given
in accordance with the security principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles. The description that
follows identifies the Agreed Security Principles and addresses the manner in which the Agreed Security
Principles will impact on and determine the extent and terms of the guarantees, including the Notes
Guarantees, and security proposed to be provided under or pursuant to any Secured Debt Document,
including the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the Security Documents.

(a) The Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may be certain
legal and practical difficulties in obtaining effective or commercially reasonable Notes Guarantees and/or
security from all relevant members of the Group in each jurisdiction in which it has been agreed that Notes
Guarantees and security will be granted by those members. In particular:

(i) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust
and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable
subordination, "transfer pricing," "thin capitalisation," "earnings stripping," "controlled foreign
corporation" and other tax restrictions, "exchange control restrictions," "capital maintenance" rules and
"liquidity impairment" rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a Notes
Guarantee or security or may require that the Notes Guarantee or security be limited as to amount or
otherwise and, if so, the Notes Guarantee or security will be limited accordingly, provided that to the
extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document,
the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost
and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or
otherwise such Notes Guarantee or Security Document shall be subject to such limit;

(ii) a key factor in determining whether or not a Notes Guarantee or security will be taken (and in
respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost
(including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs
and all applicable legal fees) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured
Parties of obtaining such Notes Guarantee or security;

286


-----

(iii) members of the Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or enter into Security
Documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal
capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties
of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction
or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer
of or for any member of the Group, provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before
signing any applicable Security Document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group
shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on
relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such Notes Guarantee or
Security Document shall be subject to such limit;

(iv) Notes Guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all
registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to
be agreed between the grantor of the security and the Security Agent;

(v) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of
granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security
will be granted over the material assets only;

(vi) it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security
over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets;

(vii) any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, licence, instrument, regulatory
constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party
arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject
to the applicable Security Document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board
or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable Security Document,
would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations
with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take
any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be
excluded from a Notes Guarantee or Security Document, _provided_ that, reasonable endeavours
(exercised for a specified period of time and without incurring material cost or instigating legal
proceedings) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the
Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security or accession document that the
asset is material and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is satisfied that such endeavours will not involve
placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

(viii) the giving of a Notes Guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the
perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the
ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course
as otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (including dealing with the secured
assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any
rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is
continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person
or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this clause (viii);

(ix) any Security Document will only be required to be notarised if required by law in order for the
relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence;

(x) no Notes Guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any Acquired Person
or Asset (and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to
support acquired indebtedness to the extent such acquired indebtedness is permitted by the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or
other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
shall be required to become a guarantor or grant security with respect to any Secured Debt Document
if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing that acquired indebtedness (including
Acquired Indebtedness or any Refinancing Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of
any security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation
thereto; no security will be granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any permitted Indebtedness
and/or to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement;

(xi) to the extent possible and unless required by applicable law, there should be no action
required to be taken in relation to the Notes Guarantee or the Collateral when any Holder assigns or
transfers any of its Senior Secured Notes to a new Holder (and, unless explicitly agreed to the contrary
in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any Security Document, no member of the Group shall bear

287


-----

or otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial, registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees
or expenses that result from any assignment or transfer by a Holder);

(xii) (other than the Real Estate Reports) no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be
required and no title insurance will be required and any security shall take subject to any matters
registered against the title to the assets as at the date of the relevant security or to which the security
is otherwise legally subject;

(xiii) security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favour of a third party (other
than in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or
prevent the creation of Security Interests over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital
or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant Security Document);

(xiv) to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favour of the Security Agent and not
the Secured Parties individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of Security Documents for all
the Secured Parties); "parallel debt" provisions will be used where necessary (and included in the
Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual Security Documents); no member of the Group will be
required to take any action in relation to any Notes Guarantees or security as a result of any assignment
or transfer by a Secured Party;

(xv) Notes Guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture
or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly-owned by
another member of the Group;

(xvi) each Security Document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction not
prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security
granted under each Security Document entered into after the Completion Date shall be deemed to be
subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant Security
Document and creation of the relevant security;

(xvii) no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(xviii) the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant
time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the
Secured Debt Documents prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing;

(xix) no Notes Guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any "Excluded Swap Obligations"
defined in accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled "Swap
_Regulations' Implications for Loan Documentation," and any update thereto by the LSTA;_

(xx) other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or other action
will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group; and

(xxi) no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security
will be required to be prepared or provided to the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative
appointed by them at the relevant time), unless (i) required for such documents to become effective or
admissible in evidence and (ii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

(b) Notwithstanding any term of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Security Document, no Senior Secured Note, Notes Guarantee or other obligation under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document may be, directly or
indirectly:

(i) guaranteed by a "controlled foreign corporation" (as defined in Section 957(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code) that is owned by a member of the Group that is a US Person (such entity owned by
a member of the Group that is a US Person, a "CFC") or by an entity (a "FSHCO") substantially all
the assets of which consist of equity interests (or equity interests and indebtedness) of one or more
CFCs, or guaranteed by a subsidiary of a CFC or FSHCO;

(ii) secured by any assets of a CFC, FSHCO or a subsidiary of a CFC or a FSHCO (including
any CFC or FSHCO equity interests held directly or indirectly by a CFC or FSHCO);

(iii) secured by a pledge or other security interest in excess of 65% of the voting equity interests
(and 100% of the non-voting equity interests) of a CFC or FSHCO; or

(iv) guaranteed by any subsidiary or secured by a pledge of or security interest in any subsidiary
or other asset, if it would result in material adverse US tax consequences as reasonably determined
by the grantor of the security or Guarantor (as applicable) and the Trustee or any other Agent.

288

Guarantees

Subject to the guarantee limitations set out in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, each Notes
Guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee for all liabilities of the Debtors
under the Secured Debt Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed
Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction (references to "security" to be read for this purpose as
including the Notes Guarantees and guarantees provided pursuant to any other Finance Document).
Security documents will secure the guarantee obligations of the relevant security provider or, if such
security is provided on a third party basis, all liabilities of the Debtors under the Secured Debt Documents,
in each case in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of these Agreed Security Principles in
each relevant jurisdiction.

Governing law and scope of security

(a) No security or Notes Guarantees shall be required to be given by (or shares or investments in)
any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not
wholly owned by another member of the Group.

(b) The parties agree that the overriding intention, subject to clause (a) above, is for security only to
be granted by and shall be limited to:

(i) the Senior Notes Issuer, on a limited recourse third party basis, in respect of the shares it holds
in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and all intercompany loans owed to it by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer;

(ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in respect of the assets described in (c), (d) and (e) of the first
paragraph under the caption "—Security—General";

(iii) Guarantors in respect only over:

(A) their material bank accounts (without control over use) located in the United Kingdom, any
jurisdiction of incorporation of a Material Subsidiary and any jurisdiction of incorporation of a
borrower under the Senior Facilities Agreement (each of the foregoing, a "Security
**Jurisdiction");**

(B) shares owned by Guarantors in other Material Subsidiaries which are Guarantors;

(C) material intercompany receivables owed to such Guarantors by other members of the Group;

(D) their Material Real Property (by way of mortgage); provided that providing any such security
over Material Real Property shall not be a requirement for any such security provider to
accede to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as a Guarantor; and

(E) all asset floating charge security to the extent it is customary to grant such security in the
jurisdiction of incorporation of such Guarantor and

(iv) direct Holding Companies (which are members of the Group) of Material Subsidiaries, on a limited
recourse third party basis, in respect of the shares in such Material Subsidiaries owned by such
Holding Companies,

and that no other security shall be required to be given by any other member of the Group or in relation to
any other asset unless specifically requested or agreed to by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (in its
absolute discretion) (together, the "Overriding Principle").

(c) All security (other than share security) will be governed by the law of, and secure only assets
located in, the jurisdiction of incorporation of the applicable grantor of the security and no action in relation
to security (including any perfection step, further assurance step, filing or registration) will be required in
jurisdictions where the grantor of the security is not incorporated. Share security over any subsidiary will
be governed by the law of the place of incorporation of that subsidiary. Any security over a structural
intercompany loan granted to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be governed by the governing law of
such structural intra-group loan document.

(d) Notwithstanding any other terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement, no security or Notes Guarantees shall be required to be granted by any member of the Group
that is not incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction, other than security over shares in a Material Subsidiary
granted by a member of the Group that is not incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction.

289

Terms of security documents

The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any Security Documents:

(a) security will not be enforceable or crystallise until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is
continuing;

(b) the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant
time) will only be able to exercise a power of attorney following the occurrence of an Event of Default which
is continuing;

(c) the Security Documents should only operate to create security rather than to impose new
commercial obligations or repeat clauses in other Secured Debt Documents and accordingly:

(i) they should not contain additional representations, undertakings or indemnities (including,
without limitation, in respect of insurance, information, maintenance or protection of assets or
the payment of fees, costs and expenses) unless these are the same as or consistent with
those contained in the other Secured Debt Documents and are required for the creation or
perfection of security; and

(ii) nothing in any Security Document shall operate or be construed so as to prohibit any
transaction, matter or other step (or a grantor of security taking or entering into the same) or
dealing in any manner whatsoever in relation to any asset (including all rights, claims, benefits,
proceeds and documentation, and contractual counterparties in relation thereto) the subject of
(or expressed to be the subject of) the security agreement if not prohibited by the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (and accordingly to such extent,
the Security Agent shall promptly effect releases, confirmations, consents to deal or similar
steps always at the cost of the relevant grantor of the security);

(d) no security will be granted over parts, stock, moveable plant, equipment or receivables if it would
require labelling, segregation or periodic listing or specification of such parts, stock, moveable plant,
equipment or receivables;

(e) perfection will not be required in respect of (i) vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of
title or (ii) letter of credit rights and tort claims (or the local law equivalent);

(f) in no event shall control agreements (or perfection by control or similar arrangements) be required
with respect to any assets (including deposit or securities accounts) (unless the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement expressly provide for any specific account (by reference to its
purpose) to be subject to specific restrictions on use);

(g) security will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets of the
same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental pledges or notices to be
delivered in respect of future acquired assets in order for effective security to be created over that class of
asset, such supplemental pledges or notices will be provided only upon request of the Security Agent
(acting on the instructions of the Trustee or another Agent) and at intervals no more frequent than annually
(unless required more frequently under local law); and

(h) each Security Document must contain a clause which records that if there is a conflict between
the Security Document and the Finance Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement then (to the fullest
extent permitted by law) the provisions of the Finance Documents or (as applicable) the Intercreditor
Agreement will take priority over the provisions of the Security Document.

Bank accounts

(a) If a member of the Group grants security over its material bank accounts it will be free to deal,
operate and transact business in relation to those accounts (including opening and closing accounts) until
the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing (unless the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents expressly provide for any specific account (by
reference to its purpose) to be subject to specific restrictions on use). For the avoidance of doubt (unless
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents expressly
provide for any specific account (by reference to its purpose) to be subject to specific restrictions on use),
there will be no "fixed" security over bank accounts, cash or receivables or any obligation to hold or pay
cash or receivables in a particular account unless the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid
interest on all the Senior Secured Notes have become immediately due and payable as a result of the
occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

(b) Where "fixed" security is required in accordance with paragraph (a) above, if required by local law
to perfect the security and it is possible to give such notice of security without disrupting the operation of

290


-----

the account(s) in question, notice of the security will be served on the account bank in relation to applicable
accounts within 10 Business Days of the date of the Security Document (or accession thereto) and the
applicable grantor of the security will use its reasonable endeavours to obtain an acknowledgement of that
notice within 20 Business Days of service. If the grantor of the security has used its reasonable endeavours
but has not been able to obtain acknowledgement or acceptance, its obligation to obtain acknowledgement
will cease on the expiry of that 20 Business Day period. Irrespective of whether notice of the security is
required for perfection, if the service of notice would prevent any member of the Group from using a bank
account in the course of its business, no notice of security will be served unless the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes have become immediately due
and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

(c) Any security over bank accounts will be subject to any security interests in favour of the account
bank which are created either by law or in the standard terms and conditions of the account bank. No
grantor of security will be required to change its banking arrangements or standard terms and conditions
in connection with the granting of bank account security.

(d) If required under applicable local law, security over bank accounts will be registered subject to
the general principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no security shall be required to be granted over, or in
respect of, any Designated Bank Account.

Real Property

(a) Except as contemplated by the Overriding Principle, there shall be no requirement to grant any
security over real property in the United Kingdom. There shall be no requirement to grant security over real
property not located in the United Kingdom.

(b) There shall be no restrictions in any Security Document restricting members of the Group from
transferring, leasing or otherwise disposing of real estate assets to other members of the Group (other
than, in respect of Material Real Property which is required to comprise part of the Collateral in accordance
with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, security granted to other members of the Group,
which shall be restricted in the manner contemplated by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) or any third
parties and, for the avoidance of doubt, no consent or approval shall be required under any Security
Document from the Trustee or the Holders for any such transfers, leases or dispositions and the Security
Agent shall be authorised to release any security over any real estate assets and provide such consent,
approval or certificate that may be requested by any member of the Group in relation to such transfers,
leases or dispositions without the need for any further consent or approval from the Trustee or the Holders
to the extent the relevant transfer, lease or disposition is not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

(c) Where granting security over any real property would require obtaining consent from a third party,
there shall be no requirement to grant security (including floating security to the extent such consent is
required) over any such real property if such consent is not obtained.

(d) Where granting security over any real property would require complying with or satisfying a
restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of a third party, the
relevant member of the Group shall, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Facilities
Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring
material cost, instigating legal proceedings and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties)
to comply with or satisfy such restriction, inhibition or arrangement following which, if the restriction,
inhibition or arrangement in favour of the third party cannot be satisfied or complied with or the third party
has not provided any consent, approval, certificate or other documentation required to register that security
at HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), there shall be no requirement to grant
security.

(e) Where granting security over any real property would require complying with or satisfying a
restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of or for the benefit
of a third party that requires the Security Agent to enter into any document pursuant to that restriction,
inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), if the Security Agent declines to enter
into such document or requests modifications to the form of any such document (it being understood that
the Security Agent is not obliged to enter into any such documentation that is not agreed with it and the
Security Agent shall not be liable to any party for requesting modifications to the form of any such document
or declining to enter into such document (acting reasonably)), there shall be no requirement to enter into
negotiations regarding that document or to grant security over that real property.

291


-----

(f) Notwithstanding that a restriction, inhibition or arrangement has been satisfied or complied with
in accordance with paragraph (d) above, if a third party has not provided any documentation or information
required for dealing with any requisition raised by HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional
equivalent) that results in an application being cancelled, then no security shall be granted over that real
property.

(g) In relation to the Material Real Properties, where there is existing security registered on the title
at HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), there shall be no requirement to apply for
the removal of such registration unless such security was granted in respect of financing obtained from
another member of the Group, ASDA Holdings UK Limited (the "Vendor") or any Affiliate of the Vendor or
a financial institution, credit institution, insurance broker or pension fund in their capacity as lenders.

(h) Where the Security Agent has the benefit of a restriction or inhibition (or the relevant jurisdictional
equivalent) on the title of a property, it shall provide its consent, approval, certificate or release in the form
required by HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), to allow any matter that is not
prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement as soon as possible
and in any event within 10 Business Days of request by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer accompanied by
a certification by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that such matter is not prohibited under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no security shall be required to be granted over, or in
respect of, any Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets.

Fixed assets

Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if a member of the Group grants security over its material
fixed assets it will be free to deal with those assets in the course of its business until the occurrence of an
Event of Default which is continuing. No notice, whether to third parties or by attaching a notice to the fixed
assets, will be prepared or given until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

Insurance policies

(a) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, a member of the Group may grant security over its
material insurance policies (excluding any third party liability or public liability insurance and any directors
and officers insurance in respect of which claims thereunder may be mandatorily prepaid, provided that
the relevant insurance policy allows security to be so granted). Notice of any security interest over
insurance policies will only be served on an insurer of the Group assets upon written request of the Security
Agent (acting on the instructions of the Trustee or another Agent), which may only be given after the
occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

(b) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing, no loss payee or other
endorsement will be made on the insurance policy and no Secured Party will be named as co-insured.

Intellectual property

(a) No security will be granted over any intellectual property which cannot be secured under the terms
of the relevant licencing agreement.

(b) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if security is granted over the relevant material
intellectual property, the grantor shall be free to deal with, use, licence and otherwise commercialise those
assets in the course of its business (including allowing its intellectual property to lapse if no longer material
to its business) until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

(c) Notice of any security interest over intellectual property will only be served on a third party from
whom intellectual property is licensed upon written request of the Security Agent, which may only be given
after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. No intellectual property security will be
required to be registered under the law of that Security Document, the law where the grantor is regulated,
or at any relevant supra-national registry. Security over intellectual property rights will be taken on an "as
is, where is" basis and the Group will not be required to procure any changes to, or corrections of filings
on, external registers.

Receivables

(a) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor
grants security over any of its receivables it will be free to deal with, amend, waive or terminate those
receivables in the course of its business until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.
No notice of security may be prepared or served until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is
continuing (other than security over structural intra-group loans). Any list of receivables provided will not
include details of the underlying contracts (but may include non-sensitive generic information to the extent

292


-----

that would allow for the creation of security) and will not be required to be updated after the delivery of the
first list by any Material Subsidiary. If required under local law, security over receivables will be registered
subject to the general principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no security shall be required to be granted over, or in
respect of, any Post-Completion Disposal Receivables.

Shares

(a) Security over shares, stocks or partnership interests will be limited to those over the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or a Material Subsidiary which is a Guarantor.

(b) Until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the legal title of the shares will remain
with the relevant grantor of the security (unless transfer of title on granting such security is customary in
the applicable jurisdiction) and any grantor of share security shall be permitted to retain and to exercise
voting rights and powers in relation to any shares and other related rights charged by it and receive, own
and retain all assets and proceeds in relation thereto without restriction or condition, provided that any
exercise of rights does not materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Security Interest
over the shares or cause an Event of Default to occur.

(c) Where customary and applicable as a matter of law, on, or as soon as reasonably practicable
and after execution (and taking into account any stamping requirements in respect of any stock transfer
form (or applicable law equivalent)) of that security or accession document, the applicable share certificate
(or other documents evidencing title to the relevant shares) and a stock transfer form executed in blank (or
applicable law equivalent) will be provided to the Security Agent.

Regulated Group

(a) No member of the Group shall be required to create security over, or otherwise encumber the
shares in or assets or liabilities of (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any bank account, receivable or
any other asset of another member of the Group which corresponds to a liability of a member of the
Regulated Group), any member of the Regulated Group or any Unrestricted Subsidiary and no member of
the Regulated Group and no Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be required to become a Guarantor.

(b) If a member of the Group is or becomes a member of the Regulated Group, the Security Agent
and/or the relevant Secured Parties (as applicable) shall, at the cost and request of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, promptly release any Collateral over the shares, assets or liabilities of (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any asset of another member of the Group which corresponds to a liability of such
member of the Regulated Group) and Notes Guarantees provided by, such member of the Regulated
Group without further consent or approval from the Trustee or the Holders.

_Security Documents_

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure the payment when
due of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into among, _inter alios, the_
relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security Agent will
have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Senior
Secured Notes. The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents and
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent. As a consequence of such
contractual provisions, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action
in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes except through the Trustee under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral.
Under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will
also act on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge
Facility, the trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture, the holders of the Senior Notes and the
counterparties under certain hedging agreements in relation to the Security Interests in favour of such
parties.

In the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy
or similar proceedings, the Security Interest created under the Security Documents or the rights and
obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement could
be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interest or the terms of

293


-----

the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders might
not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to
_the Senior Secured Notes" and "—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our_
_Indebtedness."_

_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that each holder of the Senior Secured Notes, by
accepting such Senior Secured Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) consented and agreed to the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance with the covenant described under "—
_Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements" (including, without limitation, the provisions_
providing for foreclosure and release of the Collateral and authorizing the Security Agent to enter into the
Security Documents on its behalf) as the same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in
accordance with its terms and authorised and directed the Security Agent to enter into the Security
Documents and to perform its obligations and exercise its rights thereunder in accordance therewith,

(2) authorised the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, to enter into the Security
Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby, and

(3) have appointed and authorised the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to the provisions
in the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement."

_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries
of any Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the covenant described under "—Limitation on Indebtedness,"
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent
shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorised representatives) an
intercreditor agreement (an "Additional Intercreditor Agreement") or a restatement, amendment or other
modification of the existing Intercreditor Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor
Agreement (or terms not materially less favourable to the Holders), including containing substantially the
same terms with respect to release of Notes Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests;
_provided_ that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the
Trustee or Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable,
adversely affect the rights, protections, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter
into one or more amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to:
(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount
or types of Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating
to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes), (3) add Restricted
Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the
Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (5) make provision for equal and
ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (6) implement any Permitted
Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof, or (8) make any other change to any such agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall otherwise be
entitled to direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into any amendment or waiver of any provision
of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, or take any action for which
instructions of Holders are required under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, with the consent of the Holders of the majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of,
or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Senior Secured Notes), unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
is entitled to request such amendment, waiver or action without the consent of Holders in accordance with
the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described below under "—Amendments and
_Waivers;"_ _provided_ that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security
Agent to enter into any amendment or waiver or take any action to the extent such amendment, waiver or

294


-----

action does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the reasonable
opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, protections,
indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also provide that, in relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on
behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition,
retirement or redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Secured Notes thereby; provided,
_however, that such transaction would comply with the covenant described under "—Limitation on_
_Restricted Payments."_

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide further that each Holder, by accepting a Senior
Secured Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered
into in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the
Security Agent to enter into any such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal
business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at our offices or at the offices of the listing
agent.

**IPO Debt Pushdown**

On, in contemplation of, or following, an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) will provide (and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the
Senior Secured Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its
successor shall be entitled to require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent) that the
terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and the Security Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice)
as described under "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions
_Following an IPO." The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to_
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) and/or the Security Documents required by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and/or take such
other action as is required by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the
matters contemplated by this paragraph, provided that any such amendment or action will not impose any
personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent, or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security
Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, protections, indemnifications, or immunities of the Trustee
or the Security Agent under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our
_Financing and Our Indebtedness—There are circumstances other than repayment or discharge of the_
_Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees will be released_
_automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will be released automatically, without your consent_
_or the consent of the relevant Trustee."_

**Release of Liens**

The Escrow Account Charges may be released in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreements
and the Escrow Account Charges. See "—Acquisition Agreement; Timing of Completion Date and Issue
_Date; Escrow of Proceeds."_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer, its Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to the
release of the Security Interest in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following
circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the Security Interest in
respect of the Issuer Share Collateral) to (a) a Person that is not the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to "—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation"), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the covenant described under "—Certain_
_Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock" or is otherwise permitted in accordance_
with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that this clause 1(b)
shall not be relied upon in the case of a transfer of Capital Stock, material intellectual property, Material
Real Property or loan receivables to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a Securitisation Subsidiary) unless
the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or otherwise become subject to a Lien in favour of the
Holders following such transfer, sale or disposal;

295


-----

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the terms of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such
Guarantor;

(3) upon becoming a member of the Regulated Group, the release of the property and other assets,
and Capital Stock, of such member of the Regulated Group, and upon the borrower under an intercompany
loan becoming a member of the Regulated Group, the release of any Security Interest in any receivables
under such intercompany loan;

(4) in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary following the release of
its Lien granted in favour of the Senior Facilities Agreement, so long as no Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that, there is no other Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary_
that would result in the requirement for the Senior Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees to be secured
on such property, assets or Capital Stock pursuant to the covenant described under "—Certain
_Covenants—Limitations on Liens";_

(5) as described under "—Amendments and Waivers";

(6) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes
or upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, as provided in "—Defeasance" and "—Satisfaction and Discharge";

(7) if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an Unrestricted
Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the release
of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(8) upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event as described under "—Certain Covenants—
_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status";_

(9) in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation;

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(11) in the case of the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan, any other Proceeds Loan, or any other
material intercompany receivables owed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries
to the Senior Notes Issuer, upon its contribution to the equity of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its
Restricted Subsidiaries following the Completion Date; or

(12) in the case of the Forecourt Assets, in connection with any Forecourt Assets Separation.

In addition, the Security Interest created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including as described under
"Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement— Provisions Following an IPO")
and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under "—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
_Security Interest."_

At the request of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and the Trustee (if required) will
take all necessary action reasonably required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior
Secured Notes and the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security
Document, subject to customary protections and indemnification. Each of the releases set forth above shall
be effected by the Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the
Trustee. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer's
Certificate and Opinion of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to
a release of the Collateral has occurred, and that such release complies with the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

_Senior Secured Notes_

Except as described below and except as described under "—Redemption for Taxation _Reasons," the_
Senior Secured Notes are not redeemable until, 2023. On and after    , 2023, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Senior Secured Notes upon not less than 10
nor more than 60 days' notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal
amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period
beginning on       of the years indicated below:

**Redemption**
**Year** **Price**

2023 ................................................................................................................. %

2024 ................................................................................................................. %

2025, and thereafter ......................................................................................... 100.000%

Prior to              2023, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem, on one or more occasions
during each 12-month period, up to 10% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
outstanding (including the principal amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes outstanding), at its
option, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at a redemption price equal to 103.0%
of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of
record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Prior to              2023, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may, on one or more occasions, redeem
up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the principal amount
of any Additional Senior Secured Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice, with funds
in an aggregate amount not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a
redemption price of % of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus accrued and
unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject
to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (including the principal
amount of any Additional Senior Secured Notes) remains outstanding immediately after each such
redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

In addition, prior to              2023, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem all or, from
time to time, a part of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days'
notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed,
plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not
including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

_Tender Offers_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Senior Secured
Notes (including, without limitation, any Change of Control Offer and any Asset Disposition Offer), if
Holders of Senior Secured Notes of such series of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured
Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any third party making such a tender
offer in lieu of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes of such series
validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes of such
series will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and, accordingly, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior
notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Senior

297


-----

Secured Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date)
following such purchase at a price equal to the price (excluding any early tender fee) offered to each other
Holder of Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer
payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such
redemption date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of
the then-outstanding Senior Secured Notes of any series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn
such Senior Secured Notes in a tender offer, Senior Secured Notes owned by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or its Affiliates or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer.

_General_

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under "—Selection and Notice" below.

Except for a redemption pursuant to "—Redemption for Taxation Reasons," any redemption may, in the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions
precedent. If such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice
shall state that, in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's discretion, the redemption date may be delayed or
extended until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such redemption may
not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions precedent have
not been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed, in each case,
as so notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the Holders; provided that in no case shall the notice
have been delivered less than 10 or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any)
occurs except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if
the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and
discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may
provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer's obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person, and such notice
of redemption may be extended if such conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer by notice to the Holders; provided that in no case shall the notice have been
delivered less than 10 or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs
except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice
is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior
Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be
payable to Holders whose Senior Secured Notes will be subject to redemption by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer.

If requested in writing by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, which request may be included in the
applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the applicable Officer's Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying
Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose)
shall distribute any amounts deposited with the Trustee, Paying Agent (or such other entity directed,
designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) to the Holders prior to the applicable
redemption date, provided, however, that Holders shall have received at least three Business Days' notice
from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of
redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable
redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break
costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Senior Secured Notes are represented by
a Global Senior Secured Note deposited with a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to
the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject
to the then applicable procedures of such clearing system.

_Selection and Notice_

If less than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the
Registrar (as applicable) will select Senior Secured Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the
case of Senior Secured Notes issued as Global Senior Secured Notes, based on a method that most nearly
approximates a pro rata selection (such as by way of pool factor) in accordance with the then applicable
procedures of the relevant clearing system), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock
exchange, clearing system or depositary requirements; provided, however, that no Senior Secured Note
of £100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Secured

298


-----

Notes in integral multiples of £1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the
Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph.

If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that
Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of
a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the
unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the
Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Senior
Secured Note, redemption will be effected in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing
system (including by application of a pool factor) or an appropriate notation will be made on such Global
Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed
portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior Secured Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on
Senior Secured Notes or portions of Senior Secured Notes called for redemption.

_Sinking Fund_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking
fund payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, except as described under "—Acquisition
_Agreement; Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds."_

_Redemption at Maturity_

On, 2026, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will redeem the Senior Secured Notes that have
not been previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued
and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant
interest payment date).

_Redemption for Taxation Reasons_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem any series of Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in
part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holders of the
relevant series of Senior Secured Notes (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption price equal to
100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed
for redemption (a "Tax Redemption Date") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record
date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined
below under "—Withholding Taxes"), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption
Date, as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer determines in
good faith that, as a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations, protocols or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction
or a change in published administrative practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a "Change in Tax Law"), a Payor (as defined below) is, or
on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes would be,
required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such series of Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case
of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts) and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be
reasonable); provided that changing the jurisdiction of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not a reasonable
measure for purposes of this section. Such Change in Tax Law must be announced and become effective
on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date).

The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor
Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment
occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under "—Selection and Notice." Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
(a) earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such

299


-----

payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such
Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any
series of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to
the Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth
a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied
and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognised standing to the effect that the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change
in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion
as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or
further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

_Open Market Purchases, Privately Negotiated Transactions, Tender Offers_

As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Permitted Holders, their
respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our
outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Senior Secured Notes or derivative instruments related
thereto, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any
applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our Indebtedness, including the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance
sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities.
The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.
Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt,
with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a
"Payor") in respect of the Senior Secured Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable,
will be made free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless
the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or
on account of, any Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Secured Note is made by or
on behalf of a Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organised, engaged in business for tax purposes, or
otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental
authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clause (1) and (2), a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction"),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor
with respect to any Senior Secured Note, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or
premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the "Additional
**Amounts") as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such**
payments, after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such
Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by such Holder in
respect of such payments on any such Senior Secured Note in the absence of such withholding or
deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes (or between a
fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant
Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or
corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax
purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction), but excluding, in each
case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Secured Note
or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Secured Note,
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner
of the Senior Secured Note to comply with a written request of the Payor (or its agent) addressed to the
Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding would be payable), to provide
certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of
the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting

300


-----

requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of
deduction or withholding of, all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is
legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the presentation of the
Senior Secured Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than 30 days after the relevant
payment is first made available for payment to the Holder, except to the extent the relevant Holder would
have been entitled to an Additional Amount on presenting the same for payment on such thirtieth day
assuming that day to have been a relevant payment date;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment under or with respect
to the Senior Secured Notes or any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment
or other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Secured Note presented for payment by or on
behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the
relevant Senior Secured Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another Paying Agent (where there
is such a Paying Agent);

(7) any Taxes that are imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the
U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") as of the Issue Date, or any amended or
successor version of such sections that are substantively comparable, any current or future regulations
promulgated thereunder, any official interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant
to an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with respect to
the foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of the Code; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent
that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the
beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member
or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted
or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such
certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor's reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax
receipts are not obtained, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as
reasonably practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Such copies shall be made available to the
Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 45 days prior to the date of such payment, the
Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary
to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless
such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in
which case the Payor may deliver such Officer's Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that
is 45 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely,
without further inquiry, on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this "Description of the
_Senior Secured Notes" there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices_
in connection with a redemption of Senior Secured Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on
or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Notes Guarantee, such reference shall be
deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts
are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Payor will pay (and will indemnify the Holder for) any present or future stamp, issue, registration,
court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or
additions to tax) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any
related interest, penalties or additions to tax) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,

301


-----

delivery or registration of any Senior Secured Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection
with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after this Offering) or the receipt of any payments with respect
thereto or any such taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or additions
to tax) imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the Senior
Secured Notes or any Notes Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of any such taxes or similar charges or
levies attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (7) above
or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is
organised, engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction
from or through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Secured Notes is made by or on
behalf of such Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third
party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has
previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the
outstanding Senior Secured Notes as described under "—Optional Redemption," the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Secured Notes (provided that Senior Secured
Notes of £100,000 or less may only be tendered and repurchased in whole and not in part) pursuant to the
offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer"), at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate
principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding
the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment"); provided that if the repurchase date is on or
after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose
name the Senior Secured Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive
interest on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in
accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy
to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing
the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Senior
Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice (the "Change of Control
**Payment Date"), which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than the later of (x) 60 days from**
the date such notice is delivered and (y) the date of completion of the Change of Control, pursuant to the
procedures required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except, in the
case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control, as described
below.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the
Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in
respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent an Officer's
Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior
Secured Notes being purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Senior Secured Notes, unless notation of the purchase of Senior Secured
Notes is to be effected in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system, deliver, or cause
to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent the Global Senior Secured Notes, in order to reflect thereon
the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder
of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes,
and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, promptly

302


-----

authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered
Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior
Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal
amount that is at least £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalisation or similar
transaction. The existence of a Holder's right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase
such Holder's Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party
from seeking to acquire the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would
constitute a Change of Control.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a
Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and
otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable
to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption
of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
as described under "—Optional Redemption," unless and until there is a default in the payment of the
applicable redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due
to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a
Change of Control; provided, however, that such Change of Control Offer is conditional upon such Change
of Control.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section
14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase
of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may rely on any noaction letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action
in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. To the extent that the provisions of any securities
laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by
virtue of the conflict.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer's ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to
a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of events that constitute
a Change of Control would result in Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt
Disposal Bridge Facility becoming immediately due and payable or subject to a mandatory prepayment.
Future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions
of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased
upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a
repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect
of such repurchase on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's ability
to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's then
existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure,
_Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance_
_an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes upon the occurrence of certain_
_events constituting a change of control as required by each Indenture."_

The definition of "Change of Control" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and
assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified
other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there
is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in
certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve a disposition of "substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear
as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's
obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control

may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

_Limitation on Indebtedness_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur
any Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the
date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the
proceeds thereof) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries would have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness
("Permitted Debt"):

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or
bankers' acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof

(ii) £690 million,

(iii) the greater of (x) £1,200 million and (y) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA,

(iv) to the extent that the Indebtedness is Senior Secured Indebtedness, an unlimited amount, if on
the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro forma application of the
proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio for the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been no greater than 2.7 to 1.0, and,

(v) in the case of any refinancing of any Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion
thereof, the aggregate amount of accrued and unpaid interest, fees, underwriting discounts, premia and
other costs and expenses Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing;

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness
or other obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the
Incurrence of such Indebtedness or other obligations (including any Guarantees thereof) is not prohibited
under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; or

(b) without limiting the covenant described under "—Limitation on Liens," Indebtedness arising by
reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to any Person securing Indebtedness of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is not prohibited
under the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary
or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any

by any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (except in respect of intercompany current liabilities
incurred in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice in connection with Cash
Management Services of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), such
Indebtedness shall be unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in
full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, in the case of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer, and the respective Guarantee, in the case of a Guarantor, in each case to the extent required
by the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

(b) (i) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in any
such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary; and (ii) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute
an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by this clause (3) by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness:

Senior Secured Notes Issuer would have been able to Incur £1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to
the first paragraph of this covenant or (B) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Senior Secured Notes

and 50% of Consolidated EBITDA.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, in its sole
discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be
required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in one or more of
the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; _provided_ that any Senior
Secured Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility pursuant to clauses (7) (other than with respect to
Capitalised Lease Obligations), (11) or (16) of the second paragraph of this covenant shall cease to be
deemed Incurred or outstanding pursuant to such clauses and shall be deemed Incurred and outstanding
pursuant to clause (1)(iv) of the second paragraph of this covenant (and any related Lien shall be deemed
Incurred pursuant to clause (b)(iii) of the definition of "Permitted Collateral Liens") from and after the first
date on which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries could have Incurred such

Indebtedness) Incurred pursuant to clauses (7), (11), (12)(b), (16) and (17) of the second paragraph of this
covenant shall cease to be deemed Incurred or outstanding pursuant to such clauses and shall be deemed
Incurred and outstanding pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on
which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, could have
Incurred such Indebtedness thereunder (to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries, as applicable, are able to reclassify or Incur any Liens securing such Indebtedness under the
covenant described under "—Limitation on Liens" after such reclassification, if applicable);

(2) (A) Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Indebtedness outstanding on the
Issue Date under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities (after giving effect to the Transactions, including
the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom) in an aggregate principal amount of up to the Sterling
Equivalent of £2,250 million, and (B) Indebtedness outstanding on the later of the Issue Date and the
Completion Date under the Senior Credit Facilities (after giving effect to the Transactions, including the
Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom) in an aggregate principal amount of up to the Sterling
Equivalent of £935 million shall, in each case, be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1)(i) of the second
paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of this
covenant, and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, letters of
guarantee, bank guarantees, bankers' acceptances, performance guarantees, performance bonds,
demand guarantees, warranty guarantees, warranty bonds, bond sureties, payment bonds or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, letters of guarantee, bank
guarantees, bankers' acceptances, performance guarantees, performance bonds, demand guarantees,

Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11),
(13), (14), (16) or (17) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and such instruments
relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of Indebtedness represented by any Disqualified Stock of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be

308

equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either
case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by
one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness;

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and

(8) in the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or
increases commitments to Incur Indebtedness or any Lien pursuant to clauses (10), (28), (30) or (31) of
the definition of "Permitted Liens" or any Permitted Collateral Lien, the Incurrence thereof for all purposes
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, will, at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's option, either (a) be
determined on the date such commitments are entered into or increased pursuant to binding
documentation or (b) be determined on the date such Indebtedness or Liens are Incurred. If the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer elects to test Incurrence as described in sub-clause (a), the full amount of
Indebtedness made available under such commitments (the "Reserved Indebtedness Amount"), and the
related Liens, will be deemed Incurred on the date of execution of such binding documentation and, if the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured
Net Leverage Ratio or any other Indebtedness or Lien Incurrence test under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing, re-borrowing or issuance of letters
of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments thereunder will be permitted under this
covenant and under the covenant described under "—Limitation on Liens," irrespective of whether the
same Incurrence test is met at the time of actual borrowing, re-borrowing or issuance of letters of credit,
bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments thereunder. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may
revoke such election at any time and from time to time.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of
commitments or obligations initially not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this "—
_Limitation on Indebtedness." Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding_
as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original
issue discount or (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other
Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this "—
_Limitation on Indebtedness," the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be permitted to designate such_
Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary and any such designation will not be deemed operative
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture).

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred or, at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, first committed pursuant
to binding documentation; _provided_ that, (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other
Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause the
applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange
rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to
have been exceeded, so long as the principal amount (or, if issued with original issue discount, the
aggregate issue price) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause
(2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any
such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date or Incurred in connection with the Acquisition
Transactions on the Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in
effect on either the Issue Date or the Completion Date, as applicable; and (c) if any such Indebtedness
that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the pound
sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness
expressed in sterling will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

309


-----

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be
deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal
amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency
from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate
applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on
the date of such refinancing.

Neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including
Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually
subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and the applicable Notes Guarantee, if any,
on substantially identical terms; _provided, however,_ that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be
contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different
collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall
or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness.

_Limitation on Restricted Payments_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly
or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the

Guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise
considered Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); and

(d) dividends or distributions payable to, payments on Subordinated Shareholder Funding held
by, and loans or other advances made to, any Parent to fund payments of interest, premia or break
costs in respect of Indebtedness (or any refinancing Indebtedness thereof) of such Parent if (x) such
Indebtedness is, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, Guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and (y) any net proceeds from such initial Indebtedness
are, directly or indirectly, contributed to the equity of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary in any form or otherwise lent to or received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form; provided that (i) any net proceeds described in sub-clause
(y) above shall be excluded for purposes of increasing the amount available for distribution pursuant
to clause (b)(ii) below and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the second paragraph of this covenant;

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer held by Persons other

permitted by clause (1)(d) above; or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person,

(any such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other
acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) are referred to herein
as a "Restricted Payment"), if:

thereafter therefrom); or

(ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not able to Incur an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness
pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under "—Limitation on Indebtedness"
after giving effect, on a pro forma basis, to such Restricted Payment; or

(b) at the time the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes any such
Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted

a conversion right or privilege in connection with which cash is paid in lieu of the issuance of fractional

EBITDA and £240 million; and

(19) Restricted Payments made to fund, directly or indirectly, any payments required pursuant to the

transferred or issued by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may
be, pursuant to such Restricted Payment, as conclusively determined by the Board of Directors of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer acting in good faith. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment
shall be its face amount.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in
clauses (1) through (19) of the second paragraph of this covenant, or is permitted pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of "Permitted
Investment," the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or
Investment (or portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances
existing on the date of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in
any manner that complies with this covenant, including as an Investment pursuant to one of more clauses
contained in the definition of "Permitted Investment."

Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this covenant or in the definition of "Permitted Investments,"
neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary shall distribute or transfer, directly
or indirectly, any material intellectual property rights owned or licensed in as of the Issue Date or, in the
case of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Completion Date to any Affiliate of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer (other than a Restricted Subsidiary) by way of a Restricted Payment or a Permitted Investment
(including transferring such material intellectual property rights to a Restricted Subsidiary in contemplation
of designating it as an Unrestricted Subsidiary).

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment to, or a
Permitted Investment into, any Parent (including by way of prepayment, purchase or redemption of any
Proceeds Loan prior to scheduled maturity) to fund the repayment, prepayment, purchase or redemption
of any Subordinated Indebtedness by such Parent, there shall be no double-counting of the two
transactions for the purposes of this covenant and only the former, not the latter, shall be deemed a
Restricted Payment or a Permitted Investment made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

_Limitation on Liens_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or
indirectly, create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary), other than Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets, Designated Bank
Accounts, Substitute Retail Assets and Post-Completion Disposal Receivables, whether owned on the
Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which
Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the "Initial Lien"), except:

(a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral,

(1) Permitted Liens, or

315


-----

(2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens, if the Senior Secured Notes and the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture (or a Notes Guarantee in the case of Liens over property or assets of
a Guarantor) are, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, directly secured equally and ratably with or
prior to, in the case of Liens with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, or prior to, in the case of Liens
with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien, for so long
as such Indebtedness is so secured. Any Lien so created to secure the Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or a Notes Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally
released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates; and

(b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens.

Any Lien securing the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Notes
Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged as set forth under "—
_Security—Release of Liens."_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Liens shall be required to secure the Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Notes Guarantees over property, assets or Capital Stock of any
Restricted Subsidiary that is a member of the Regulated Group or over any intercompany receivables owed
by or to members of the Regulated Group; upon any Restricted Subsidiary becoming a member of the
Regulated Group, Security Interests over such property, assets, Capital Stock or intercompany receivables
shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged.

_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or
otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual
restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(B) make any loans or advances to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

Restricted Subsidiary,

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock, and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to or arising from (a) any Credit Facility (including the
Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, the Senior Bridge Facility and the Forecourt
Disposal Bridge Facility), (b) the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (c) the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture, (d) the Acquisition Agreement, (e) the

to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or before the date on which such Person

Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than
Capital Stock or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration for, or to provide all or any portion of the funds
utilised to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or was merged,
consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided
that, if another Person is the Successor Company (as defined under "—Merger and Consolidation"), any

Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an "Initial Agreement") or contained in any
amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this
paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to
such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favourable in any
material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the
Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other
modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior
Management);

(4) (a) any encumbrance or restriction:

(i) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or

(ii) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements permitted under
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to the extent such

mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

(iii) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set
forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary; or

agreement, interest, overriding interest, wayleave, option, right of pre-emption, right of first refusal or
charge registered or existing, in each case, in respect of any real property interests of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary as at either the Issue Date or, in the case of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, the Completion Date or not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture

assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or indirect sale or disposition to a
Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property
or assets that are subject to such restriction), pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

whole, are not materially less favourable to the Holders of the Senior Secured Notes than (a) the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior Facilities Agreement, together with the security
documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the

317


-----

Completion Date, (b) is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Board of

adversely affect, in any material respect, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's ability to make principal or
interest payments on the Senior Secured Notes;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with factoring, securitisations, receivables financings or similar
arrangements, including (without limitation) by a Securitisation Subsidiary in a Qualified Securitisation

_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to,
consummate any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for
such Asset Disposition is not less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of as of the date of
entry into binding documentation in respect of such Asset Disposition (as determined by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer's Board of Directors); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary
receives in respect of such Asset Disposition consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of such
Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset
Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer's or such Restricted Subsidiary's balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the
date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than
Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such liabilities, or (y) Indebtedness of
a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Disposition, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and every other Restricted Subsidiary is released
from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (D) or (F) in the second paragraph
of this covenant;

(vi) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
Guarantor received from Persons who are not the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness (i) has been extinguished by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, and (ii) is not Subordinated Indebtedness of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at any one time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of 20% of Consolidated EBITDA and £120.0 million (with the

318


-----

fair market value of each issue of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(viii) any combination of the types of consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this
clause (2).

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition,
within 360 days (or such period as provided in clause (H) below, if applicable) of the later of the date of
consummation of such Asset Disposition and receipt of such Net Available Cash, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may use the Net Available Cash to:

(A) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary
tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Senior Secured Indebtedness
Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under "—Limitation _on_
_Indebtedness"; provided that (in respect of Senior Secured Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1)(iv) of_
the second paragraph of the covenant described under "—Limitation _on Indebtedness") the Senior Secured_
Notes Issuer shall be entitled to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem such Indebtedness that constitutes
Public Debt only if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this
covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase Senior Secured Notes, in accordance with the provisions set
forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer, in such an amount as would reduce the aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes then outstanding in the same proportion as the aggregate principal
amount of such other Indebtedness would be reduced by such prepayments, repayments, purchases or
redemptions;

(ii) unless included in (A)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market
purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) Senior Secured
Notes or other Senior Secured Indebtedness that is Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer shall be entitled to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem such other Senior Secured
Indebtedness that constitutes Public Debt only if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer makes (at such time or
in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase Senior Secured Notes, in accordance
with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer, in such an amount as would reduce the
aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes then outstanding in the same proportion as the
aggregate principal amount of such other Senior Secured Indebtedness would be reduced by such
prepayments, repayments, purchases or redemptions; or

(iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender
offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary
that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets that do not constitute Collateral (in
each case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor or
Indebtedness owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary);

_provided that in the case of an Asset Disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, the Senior Secured_
Notes Issuer may prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Subordinated Indebtedness secured by a Lien on
the Collateral only if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer first makes (at such time or in compliance with this
covenant) an offer to Holders of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes to purchase their Senior Secured
Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer;

(B) purchase any series of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such series of
Senior Secured Notes, redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or
privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any series of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the
redemption provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or by making an Asset Disposition Offer to
all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below);

(C) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Person engaged
in a Similar Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, such Person is or
becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(E) make a capital expenditure;

(F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or
useful in a Similar Business;

(G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(H) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated

319


-----

as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of
(x) the date on which such investment is consummated, and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of
the aforementioned 360-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth above constitutes "Excess Proceeds."
Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner
that is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

On the 361st day (or the 541[st ]day if a binding commitment as described in clause (H) is entered into)
after an Asset Disposition, or such earlier time as the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects, if the aggregate
amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds £50.0 million, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required within
10 Business Days thereof to make an offer ("Asset Disposition Offer") to all Holders and, to the extent
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects, to all or some holders of other outstanding Senior Secured
Indebtedness that is Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Senior
Secured Notes and any such other Senior Secured Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess
Proceeds, at an offer price, in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, and, in respect of such other Senior Secured Indebtedness, of no more than 100% of the principal
amount thereof, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase. The Asset Disposition Offer in respect of Senior Secured Notes will be made in accordance with
the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in minimum denominations of £100,000
and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Senior Secured Indebtedness
that is Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset
Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may use any
remaining Excess Proceeds (the "Retained Declined Proceeds") for any purpose not otherwise prohibited
by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and such other
Senior Secured Indebtedness validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition
Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the
tendering holders of Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness pro rata based
on the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness
so tendered and not properly withdrawn. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such
Indebtedness tendered in an Asset Disposition Offer that is not denominated in sterling, such principal
amount shall be converted into its Sterling Equivalent as of a date selected by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period or no more than five Business Days prior to the
beginning of the Asset Disposition Offer Period. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the
amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are
denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the
net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually
received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into
such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a
period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the "Asset Disposition Offer
**Period"). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the**
"Asset Disposition Purchase Date"), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will purchase the principal amount
of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects, Senior Secured Indebtedness required to be repaid
or purchased by it pursuant to such offer (the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount") or, if less than the
Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Senior
Secured Indebtedness that is Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset
Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent
lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount
of Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes
and Senior Secured Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset
Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples
of £1,000 in excess thereof.

320


-----

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such
Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Paying Agent, as
the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the
Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase
price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and
accepted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for purchase. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will
be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred or returned in accordance with applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream) by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the Holder thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section
14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase
of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions
of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have
breached its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall
not consummate Sale and Leaseback Transactions with any Person (other than the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) that, when taken together with all Sale and Leaseback Transactions
consummated since the Issue Date, would yield, in aggregate, gross proceeds of more than the lesser of
(x) £1,200 million and (y) £1,400 million minus the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to clause (12)(b) of the definition of "Permitted Debt" and outstanding at the time of determination.

The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's
obligation to make an Asset Disposition Offer may be waived or modified with the consent of Holders of a
majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (with such consent, for the avoidance
of doubt, to be considered effective if the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes of
consenting Holders represents a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes as a whole and without regard to the level of consent obtained among Holders of each
constituent series of Senior Secured Notes).

_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to enter
into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or
exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an "Affiliate Transaction") involving
aggregate value in excess of the greater of 10% of Consolidated EBITDA and £120 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction, taken as a whole, are not materially less favourable to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be
obtained in a comparable transaction with a Person who is not an Affiliate at the time of such transaction
or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm's-length dealings; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of
20% of Consolidated EBITDA and £240 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related
transactions have been approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under "—
_Limitation on Restricted Payments," any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of_
the second paragraph of the covenant described under "—Limitations on Restricted Payments") or any
Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the
definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities,
or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to the terms of, the funding
of, entering into or maintenance of (i) any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan,
program, agreement or arrangement and any related trust or other similar agreement, (ii) any other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, (iii) restricted stock plans, long-term
incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or
consultants' plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement,
savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or (iv) indemnities provided on behalf of officers,

Issuer, in each case, in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice;

(4) any transaction between or among the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and any Restricted
Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or
among Restricted Subsidiaries or any Securitisation Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities
(including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on
behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Restricted
Subsidiary or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or
controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees);

(6) (i) the Transactions, excluding the ASDA Leases, and (ii) the ASDA Leases, to the extent entered
into or replaced or amended from time to time on terms substantially consistent with those described in
this Offering Memorandum;

(iii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries as of the Issue Date under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated
by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of
or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented,
extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this
covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect;

(iv) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any payments pursuant to or for
purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Completion Date, as these
agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or
refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more
disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect; and

(v) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement
pursuant to which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is required or

with past practice;

(8) transactions with customers, contractors, clients, franchisees, licensees, sub-licensees, crosslicensees, landlords (including superior landlords), lessors, sub-lessors, trade creditors, service providers,

consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management,
or are on terms no less favourable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from
an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or
among the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely
because the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in
or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

(10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference
Shares) of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital

good faith;

the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the

unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred since
the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (other than
the Acquisition and unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report provided
pursuant to clauses (2), (3) or (4) below); provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided
only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) the audited consolidated
balance sheet of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as at the end of the most recent fiscal year and audited
consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for the

risk factors and material subsequent events; provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and (v)
may be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements;

year, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal years
and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; and (ii) within 90 days after the end
of any fiscal quarter of the Company ending prior to the Completion Date, the Company's unaudited
condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed
statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter or year-to-date period ending on the
unaudited condensed balance sheet date, prepared in accordance with IFRS;

(3) within 60 days following the end of each of the first three quarters in each fiscal year of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer ending after the Completion Date (or, in the case of the first three such fiscal quarters
ending after the Completion Date, 90 days), quarterly financial statements containing the following
information: (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at
the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent
quarter or year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable

to include divisional or segment financial information other than as required under IFRS); (ii) unaudited pro
_forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, together with_
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalisations that have occurred

the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials); (iii) a concise operating and
financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial

recent report; and (v) material subsequent events and any material changes to the risk factors disclosed
in the most recent annual report; provided that the information described in clauses (iv) and (v) may be
provided in the footnotes to the unaudited financial statements; and

(4) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer announces
publicly or any acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar transaction that is material to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (other than the Acquisition), taken as a whole,
or a senior executive officer or director changes at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a change in auditors
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a report containing a description of such event; provided that, if the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer intends to make a public announcement of the appointment of a new senior
executive officer other than by means of a report pursuant to this clause (4), the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer may delay furnishing such report to the Trustee until the day on which the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer otherwise makes such public announcement.

In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors,
upon the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are not freely transferable under the
Exchange Act by persons who are not "affiliates" under the Securities Act.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the
Senior Secured Notes copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's
website.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS and on a consistent basis
for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however,
that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present
earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as specified in the second succeeding
paragraph, no report need include separate financial statements for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or
any of its Subsidiaries or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or
statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth
above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may satisfy its obligations under the
preceding paragraphs of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual and quarterly
reports or other information of the Company or any Parent of the Company, for so long as the Company
or such Parent is either a Subsidiary or a Parent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. To the extent that
material differences exist between the management, business, assets, shareholding or results of
operations or financial condition of such other reporting entity and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the
annual and quarterly reports shall include a concise description and an unaudited reconciliation of such

324


-----

material differences. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will
be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

At any time that any of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries
and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes
a Significant Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial
information required by the first paragraph of this "Reports" covenant will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer.

All reports provided pursuant to this "Reports" covenant shall be made in the English language. In the
event that (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section
13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to
file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to
provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
(other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal
controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make available to
the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying
with the foregoing requirement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

Following an initial public offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity or the listing of such Capital
Stock on a recognised stock exchange, the reporting obligations of the reporting entity pursuant to the
preceding paragraphs of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies
with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange (other than with respect to delivery of a compliance
certificate).

_Merger and Consolidation_

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey,
transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to,
any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Company") will be a Person
organised and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom,
Jersey, the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada
or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee,
in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under
the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (if any)
and the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes
an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be
able to Incur at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant
described under "—Limitation on Indebtedness" or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less
than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and
an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that execution and delivery of the binding documentation
providing for such consolidation, merger or transfer and of such supplemental indenture (if any) do not
result in a breach of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorised, executed and delivered and is a valid and binding
agreement, enforceable against the Successor Company in accordance with its terms (in each case, in

325


-----

form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any
Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with
the covenant described under "—Limitation on Indebtedness."

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer to any person other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which
properties and assets, if held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would
constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on a
consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets
of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture but in the case of a
lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve "substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this "Merger
_and Consolidation" covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition_
if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has complied with the covenant described under "—Limitation on Sales
_of Assets and Subsidiary Stock" or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary._

The Guarantors

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms
of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement) may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving
corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the assets
of such Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related
transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor or, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, becomes a Guarantor (pursuant to a
supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee);

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or, subject to
the Agreed Security Principles, the transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the
Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (pursuant to a
supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee);
and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have
occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or
merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor
(in each case other than to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise
permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this heading "—The Guarantors"_
shall not apply to the extent that compliance with clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B)(1) could give rise to or result
in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalisation rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws
rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the
officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of
such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or

326


-----

shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including
with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

_General_

The provisions set forth in this "Merger and Consolidation" covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) a Guarantor from merging
or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or another Guarantor; (iii) a Guarantor transferring all or part of its properties and assets to a Restricted
Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor in order to comply with any law, rule, regulation or order,
recommendation or directions of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (iv) any consolidation or merger of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not
the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture,
the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and
clauses (1) and (4) under the heading "—Senior Secured Notes Issuer" shall apply to such transaction; (v)
a Permitted Reorganisation or the solvent liquidation of any Restricted Subsidiary; (vi) the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or
organised for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in
another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and
(4) under the heading "—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer" or clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B) under the heading
"—The Guarantors," as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction; and (vii) any corporate
reorganisations or other steps necessary or advisable to consummate or facilitate the Transactions.

_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade
Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a "Suspension Event"), then,
beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Secured Notes cease to
have Investment Grade Status (the "Reversion Date"), the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture summarised under the following captions will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes:

(1) "—Limitation on Restricted Payments";

(2) "—Limitation on Indebtedness";

(3) "—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries";

(4) "—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions";

(5) "—Additional Notes Guarantees";

(6) "—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock"; and

(7)  the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under "—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer"_

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will cease to be
effective and will not be applicable to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any
effect with regard to actions of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion
Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The "Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant will be
interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture but not during
the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the
continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that
it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
_"—Limitation on Indebtedness," as applicable. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also_
permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the
Restricted Subsidiaries to honour any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date
on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual
commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Secured
Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall notify the

327


-----

Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, provided
that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this
caption to be effective.

There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment
Grade Status.

_Impairment of Security Interest_

The Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not, and in each case, shall not
permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would
have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being
understood that neither the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, nor any Forecourt Assets Separation,
nor any repayment of intercompany receivables from time to time (including the Forecourt Disposal
Receivable), nor any distribution or disposal of Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets, Substitute Retail
Assets, Designated Bank Accounts or Post-Completion Disposal Receivables shall under any
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the
benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
shall not, and in each case, shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than
the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in
the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any
interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that:

(i) the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may
Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged and released and retaken in
accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent applicable in each case;

(ii) the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or replaced, from time to time to: (1) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or
inconsistency therein, (2) further secure the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured
Notes), (3) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior
Secured Notes, (4) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (5) amend the Security Documents in
accordance with the terms thereof, or (6) make any other change to any such agreement that does not
adversely affect the Holders in any material respect;

(iii) any Permitted Reorganisation may be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(iv) any corporate reorganisations or other steps necessary or advisable to consummate or facilitate
the Transactions may be implemented; or

(v) the Security Documents may otherwise be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released and retaken, or replaced where, contemporaneously with any such action, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer delivers to the Trustee:

(1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an
Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as
applicable, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, release or replacement,

(2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person confirming the solvency of the
person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment,
extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or replacement, or

(3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming
that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents,
so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not
otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien
or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement.

In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted
Subsidiaries (as applicable) comply with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security
Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without
the need for instructions from the Holders.

328


-----

_Additional Notes Guarantees_

No Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor shall Guarantee (i) any Indebtedness of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor under any Syndicated Term Facilities, (ii) any Indebtedness of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor under any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate
lending commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination, or (iii) any Public
Debt, unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor by no later than 10 Business Days
after the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee
a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to which
such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee; provided that:

(a) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to provide a Notes Guarantee pursuant to this covenant
as a result of Incurring a Guarantee under clause (2)(b) of the definition of "Permitted Debt";

(b) no Restricted Subsidiary that is a member of the Regulated Group shall be required to provide a
Notes Guarantee pursuant to this covenant; and

(c) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be obligated to become a Guarantor pursuant to this covenant to
the extent that, and for so long as, the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee would be inconsistent with the
Agreed Security Principles or may reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (1) any breach or
violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin
capitalisation rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or
regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers,
directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation
(including with respect to any Taxes) which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to
the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, other than reasonable expenses incurred
in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings undertaken in connection with such Notes
Guarantee.

At the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on such
Guarantor's liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognise certain defences generally available
to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under
"—Notes Guarantees." A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer if, at the date of such release, there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor
outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance
with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The
Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or
waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any
release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the
Security Agent being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of
each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in "Risk Factors" and "Certain
_Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests."_

_Financial Calculations_

When determining whether any transaction is permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be permitted to test it, at its option, (i) on the date binding documentation
for such transaction is entered into, (ii) on the date that any notice of any repayment, redemption,
repurchase or refinancing of any Indebtedness is given to the holders thereof (if applicable), (iii) to the
extent the nature or circumstances of a transaction make (i) or (ii) inapplicable, on the date that notice of
such transaction is provided to the Holders in accordance with the provisions described in "—Notices"
below or (iv) the date such transaction is consummated. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to test
the transaction as described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the determination as to whether the transaction
is permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be made assuming that the transaction and
other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith were consummated on the date binding
documentation was entered into or such notice was given to the Trustee or the Holders (each, an
"Alternative Testing Date"), as applicable. If the transaction was permitted on the Alternative Testing Date
chosen by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, it shall continue to be deemed so permitted under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture even if it would have otherwise resulted in a Default or an Event of Default on

329


-----

the date it is consummated. When determining whether any transaction is permitted under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture as of the Alternative Testing Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make all
necessary calculations as set forth under the definition of "Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio."

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has elected to test a transaction on an Alternative Testing Date (an
"Alternative Testing Date Election"), the transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on such date for
the purposes of making any other determination under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, until such time
(the "Election Termination Time") as (a) the transaction is definitively terminated, cancelled or
abandoned, (b) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has revoked its Alternative Testing Date Election and has
instead opted to test the transaction on the date it is consummated, which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
will be entitled to do, irrevocably and only once, at any time until the transaction is consummated, or (c) the
transaction is consummated. From the time the Senior Secured Notes Issuer makes an Alternative Testing
Date Election to the related Election Termination Time, the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture will apply assuming that the relevant transaction was consummated on the Alternative Testing
Date. No action properly taken by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
between an Alternative Testing Date Election and the related Election Termination Time will constitute a
Default or an Event of Default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture will permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honour any contractual commitments undertaken during such
period of time, so long as they were not undertaken in anticipation of the Election Termination Time.

_Topco Covenant_

Within 10 Business Days (or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter to the extent that consent or
requirements of third parties are required to be obtained or satisfied) after all amounts due and payable
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility have been repaid in full or the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility has otherwise been irrevocably satisfied and discharged, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer shall procure that Topco and its controlled Affiliates contribute to the equity of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, lend to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as Subordinated Shareholder Funding or
apply toward repayment of Post-Completion Disposal Receivables held by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries: (i) any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets owned
by Topco or any such controlled Affiliates of Topco at such time, and (ii) an amount equal to any Net
Available Cash received by Topco or any such controlled Affiliates of Topco from sale and leaseback
transactions or other disposals in respect of such assets (including any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds)
that have not been applied toward repayment or prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge
Facility (each such contribution, loan or repayment a "Retail Assets Contribution"). For the avoidance of
doubt, any failure by Topco or any of Topco's controlled Affiliates to make any required Retail Assets
Contributions shall constitute a default of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's obligation to procure such
contributions.

Neither Topco nor any of Topco's controlled Affiliates, other than the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, will become parties to, or otherwise be bound by, the terms of
the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries have the direct power to control the management or policies of Topco or any of its
controlled Affiliates (other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries). See "Risk
_Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition—The Issuers do not control Topco and cannot directly cause_
**_Topco to effect the Retail Assets Contribution."_**

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an "Event of Default" under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Secured Note issued under the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior Secured Note
issued under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional
redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted
Subsidiaries to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes with its other agreements contained in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture;

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Senior Secured

330


-----

Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created
after the Issue Date, which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such Indebtedness, immediately upon
the expiration of the grace period provided in such Indebtedness ("payment default"); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the "cross acceleration
**provision"),**

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal amount
of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the maturity of which
has been so accelerated, aggregates £60 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Senior Notes Issuer, Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together
(as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the "bankruptcy provisions");

(6) failure by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted
Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final
judgments aggregating in excess of £60 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance
company has acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period
of 60 days after the judgment becomes final (the "judgment default provision");

(7) (a) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to be in full force
and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and except
through the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to
Collateral having a fair market value in excess of £60.0 million, for any reason other than the satisfaction
in full of all obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the release of any such security
interest in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, or (b) any such security interest created
thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer shall assert in writing that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and
in each case under clauses (a) and (b), any such Default continues for 10 days (the "security default
**provision"); and**

(8) any Notes Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect (other than
in accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) or is
declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or any Guarantor denies or disaffirms
in writing its obligations under its Notes Guarantee and, in each case, any such Default continues for 10
days (the "guarantees provision").

A Default under clauses (4) or (6) of the preceding paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
unless the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes
under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture notify the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of the Default and the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer fails to cure such Default within the time specified in clauses (4) or (6), as
applicable, of the preceding paragraph, after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, by
written notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of
such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the
Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, to be due and payable. Upon such a
declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately.
For the avoidance of doubt, the bankruptcy provisions will exclude the enforcement of Liens described in
clause (31) of the definition of "Permitted Liens," including by way of appointment of a receiver for such
purpose.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default
described in clause (4) under "Events of Default" has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment
default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) has been remedied or cured, or waived by
the holders of the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default, or the Indebtedness that gave rise

331


-----

to such Event of Default has been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration
with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all other Events of Default
outstanding, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Secured Notes that
became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes will become and be immediately
due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior
Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security
Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect
to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such
acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not
conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if
an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders
unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee
against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest
when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the
Senior Secured Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have
requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any
loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and
the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not
given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within
such 60-day period.

Other than in cases where the Senior Secured Notes Indenture permits the Trustee or the Security
Agent to act without instructions from Holders or with instructions given by Holders of a lower percentage
of principal amount of Senior Secured Notes outstanding, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of
the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be entitled to (i)
direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, (ii) give instructions to the Security Agent for the purpose of taking, ceasing or refraining from
taking any enforcement action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement or the Security Documents, (iii) give instructions to the Security Agent for the purpose of
granting or withholding any such consent or exercising any such remedy or power as may be required or
contemplated under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or
the Security Documents, or (iv) give instructions to the Trustee for the purposes of giving or withholding
any such consent, taking, ceasing or refraining from taking any such action or exercising any such remedy
or power as may be contemplated under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred
and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will
be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the
conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law
or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of
any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory

332


-----

to it against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior
Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed
of such occurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the
Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a
Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the
Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the
interests of the Holders. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the
Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year,
an Officer's Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that
occurred during the previous year. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee
(and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 30 days after the occurrence thereof,
written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and
what action the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a
required certificate in connection with another default (an "Initial Default") then at the time such Initial
Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the
Initial Default will also be cured without any further action, and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the
failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled "—Certain Covenants— Reports"
or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or
notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified
in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes
then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Senior Secured Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any
provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase
of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Senior Secured Notes); _provided_ that, if any amendment,
supplement, other modification or waiver will only amend, supplement or waive a default or provision
affecting only one series of the Senior Secured Notes, only the consent of Holders representing a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such series shall be
required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Senior Secured Notes affected, then outstanding, an amendment or waiver of the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by
a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Senior Secured
Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Secured Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Secured Note or change the time
at which any Senior Secured Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under "—Optional
_Redemption";_

(5) make any Senior Secured Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior Secured
Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or Additional
Amounts, if any, on such Holder's Senior Secured Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute
suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to such Holder's Senior Secured Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture described under
"Withholding Taxes" that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Secured Notes in any
material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Secured Notes in a way that would result in a loss of
an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold

333


-----

or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the applicable Payor
agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect thereof;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal, premium or
interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes (except pursuant to a rescission of
acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount
of such Senior Secured Notes and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from such acceleration);
or

(9) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders' consent
described in this sentence,

_provided, however, that if such amendment or waiver described above only affects or would only affect_
Holders of one or more series of Senior Secured Notes (but not all series of Senior Secured Notes), only
the consent of Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding
Senior Secured Notes of the series so affected shall be required.

Without the consent of Holders holding not less than 80% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Secured Notes affected, then outstanding, an amendment or waiver of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the Security Documents may not, with respect to any Senior Secured Notes held by a nonconsenting Holder, (a) release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the
Holders in the Collateral other than in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any
applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the applicable
Security Documents, or (b) permit all or substantially all of the relevant Guarantors to be released from
their obligations under the Notes Guarantees or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, except in accordance
with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any applicable
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; _provided_ that, if any such amendment or waiver will only amend,
supplement or waive a default or provision affecting only one series of the Senior Secured Notes, only the
consent of Holders representing 80% in aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior
Secured Notes of such series shall be required.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the
Trustee, the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any
Notes Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender
any right or power conferred upon the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any material
respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a
member of Senior Management) for the issuance of Additional Senior Secured Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in accordance with the
covenant described under "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness" or "—Certain Covenants—
_Additional Notes Guarantees," to add Guarantees with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, to add security_
to or for the benefit of the Senior Secured Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination,
discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or
any amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Senior Secured Notes when such
release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Documents or the Senior Secured Notes to any provision of this "Description of the Senior
_Secured Notes" to the extent that such provision in this "Description of the Senior Secured_ _Notes" was_
intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Security
Documents or the Senior Secured Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee

334


-----

or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide for the accession by the Trustee or
Security Agent to any Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security
interest in favour of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties to the Senior Facilities
Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security Documents or the Senior Facilities Agreement
(as in effect on the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or
hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent
necessary to grant a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; _provided_ that the
granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under "—
_Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest" is complied with; or_

(10) as provided in "—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements" or in "—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest";_

_provided_ that, only the consent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the relevant
Guarantors or security providers shall be required to give effect to any amendment or supplement providing
for additional Notes Guarantees or security or modifying the terms of Notes Guarantees or security
pursuant to clauses (3), (6), (7), (9) or (10) above.

The Trustee and the Security Agent (where relevant) shall, at the direction of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer, sign any supplemental indenture or other documentation that gives effect to amendments, waivers
or supplements authorised as described under this heading "Amendments and Waivers" if the amendment,
waiver or supplement does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent.
Except as set forth in the preceding proviso, it shall only be necessary for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
the Trustee and the Security Agent (where relevant) to authorise and execute a supplemental indenture or
other documentation in order to effect an amendment, waiver or supplement authorised as described under
this heading "Amendments and Waivers." Unless otherwise specified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer,
a waiver authorised as described under this heading "Amendments and Waivers" will become effective
once the requisite consent of Holders has been obtained, without execution of any supplemental indenture
or other documentation.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to approve the
particular form of any proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent
approves the substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture by any Holder of Senior Secured Notes given in connection with a tender
of such Holder's Senior Secured Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

A written consent to an amendment or a waiver by a Holder shall bind the Holder and every subsequent
Holder of that Senior Secured Note or portion of the Senior Secured Notes that evidences the same
Indebtedness as the consenting Holder's Senior Secured Note, even if notation of the consent or waiver is
not made on the Senior Secured Note. Unless otherwise specified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, no
Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the written consent or waiver as to such Holder's Senior Secured
Note or portion of the Senior Secured Note once delivered to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. After an
amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose
of determining the Holders entitled to give their written consent or take any other action. If a record date is
fixed, then only those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies)
shall be entitled to give such consent (and revoke any consent previously given, if relevant) or to take any
such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No consent shall
be valid or effective for more than 180 days after such record date.

For purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Secured Notes have taken any action under this Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the aggregate principal
amount of Senior Secured Notes will be deemed to be the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal
amount of such Senior Secured Notes as of (i) the record date in respect of such action (if a record date
has been set with respect to the taking of such action), (ii) the date the taking of such action by Holders of
the requisite aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes has been certified to the Trustee
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or (iii) as of a date selected by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that
is within the consent delivery period or no more than five Business Days prior to the beginning of the
consent delivery period, as specified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the relevant consent materials.

335


-----

In formulating their decisions on matters set forth in this Section "Amendments and Waivers," the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as they
deems necessary, including Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

For avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with any of
the covenants described under, "—Certain Covenants" and any related definitions shall be deemed to
impair or affect any rights of holders of the Senior Secured Notes to receive payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on, the Senior Secured Notes.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have
concurred in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Secured Notes owned by the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect
common control with, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, independent
debt funds of Permitted Holders) will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture
("legal defeasance") and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain
obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities
and indemnities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in connection
therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Senior Secured Notes, registration of Senior
Secured Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Secured Notes and the maintenance of an office
or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under
the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in effect at
such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors' obligations under
the covenants described under "Certain Covenants" (other than clauses (1) and (2) of "—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer") and "Change of Control" and_
the default provisions relating to such covenants described under "Events of Default" above, the operation
of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions
with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the
guarantee provision and the security default provision described under "Events of Default" above
("covenant defeasance").

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option
notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated
because of an Event of Default with respect to such Senior Secured Notes. If the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, payment of the
Senior Secured Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other
than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant described under "—Certain Covenants—Merger
_and Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer"), (4), (5) (other than with respect to the Senior_
Secured Notes Issuer), (6), (7) or (8) under "Events of Default" above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit
in trust (the "defeasance trust") with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed (as agent) by
the Trustee for this purpose), for the benefit of Holders of Senior Secured Notes, cash in sterling or sterlingdenominated UK Government Obligations or a combination thereof, for the payment of principal, premium,
if any, and interest on the outstanding Senior Secured Notes to the applicable date of redemption or Stated
Maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the
Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Senior
Secured Notes will not recognise income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of
such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in
the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had
not occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must
be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income
tax law);

336


-----

(2) an Officer's Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer; and

(3) an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions precedent provided for or relating
to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be
discharged and cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or
exchange of the Senior Secured Notes, as expressly provided for in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture)
as to all outstanding Senior Secured Notes when:

(1) either (a) all the Senior Secured Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other than certain
lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Secured Notes, and certain Senior Secured Notes for which provision for
payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer) have been delivered to the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation; or (b) all Senior Secured Notes
not previously delivered to the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation (i) have become due and payable,
(ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of
notice of redemption by the Principal Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer;

(2) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or
another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this purpose), for the benefit of Holders
of Senior Secured Notes, money or sterling-denominated UK Government Obligations or a combination
thereof, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on the Senior Secured Notes
not previously delivered to the Principal Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and
interest to the date of deposit (in the case of Senior Secured Notes that have become due and payable),
or to the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be;

(3) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture;

(4) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the
funds deposited towards the payment of the Senior Secured Notes at maturity or on the redemption date,
as the case may be; and

(5) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an
Opinion of Counsel (which the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on) each to the effect
that all conditions precedent under the "Satisfaction and Discharge" section of the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture have been
complied with, provided that any such counsel may rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact
(including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

If requested in writing by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, which request may be included in the
applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the applicable Officer's Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying
Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose)
shall distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to the applicable redemption date or Stated
Maturity, as applicable, of the Senior Secured Notes; provided that Holders shall have received at least
three Business Days' notice from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may
be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to
Holders prior to the applicable redemption date or Stated Maturity, as applicable, of the Senior Secured
Notes as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or
any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Senior Secured Notes are represented by a Global
Senior Secured Note deposited with a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the
beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to
the then applicable procedures of such clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any
of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect
of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Secured Note

waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of
the Senior Secured Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal
securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event
of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee
has received written notice, the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in
conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action
enumerated in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should
it become a creditor of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or
to realise on certain property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee
will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Affiliates
and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be
removed, and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at
any time by the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Secured Notes, or
may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and (2) that if the
Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires actual knowledge of a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b)
fails to meet certain eligibility requirements or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes
insolvent or bankrupt, then the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who
has been a bona fide Holder for not less than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee
and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for
any loss, liability, taxes (other than net income or similar taxes), expenses incurred without gross
negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Except as otherwise provided in the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to request and rely conclusively and without further
investigation upon Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel in formulating its opinion or in taking any
action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices with respect to the Senior Secured Notes will be published on the Senior Notes Issuer's website.
In addition, for so long as any Senior Secured Notes are represented by Global Senior Secured Notes,
notices to Holders of the Senior Secured Notes shall be delivered via Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices
are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the
seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such
Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so
mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it
shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the
manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this "Description of the Senior Secured Notes," the notice
requirements in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures
of Euroclear and Clearstream for so long as the Senior Secured Notes are held as Global Senior Secured
Notes. To the extent the mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream conflict with any
requirements applicable to notices under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, a notice will be deemed to
satisfy such requirements if it complies with the mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear and
Clearstream concerning the content, timing and procedure for delivering notices and otherwise complies
with any applicable requirements under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture.

338


-----

**Prescription**

Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or
premium, if any, on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for
payment thereof. Claims against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of
interest on the Senior Secured Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment
of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Sterling-Denominated Restrictions**

Sterling is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer and the Guarantors under or in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the related Notes
Guarantees, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than sterling,
whether as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the
winding-up or dissolution of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder
or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due to it from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
or a Guarantor in connection with the Senior Secured Notes and the related Notes Guarantees will only
constitute a discharge to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent
of the sterling amount which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in
that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase
on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that sterling amount received in accordance with the preceding paragraph is less than the amount
expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Senior Secured Note, the Senior Secured
Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the
Trustee as a result. In any event, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the
recipient or the Trustee on a joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the
purposes of this currency indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein
for the Holder of a Senior Secured Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the
Senior Secured Notes Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any
such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer's and the Guarantors' other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent
cause of action, will apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Secured Note or
the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out herein) and will continue in full force and effect
despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under
any Senior Secured Note or any Notes Guarantee, or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
sterling-denominated restriction herein (i) the Sterling Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-sterling currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date such non-sterling amount is Incurred or paid, as the case may be and (ii) currency
translations shall be made taking into account any cross currency derivatives entered into by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Where any such calculations involve the
determination of a financial metric over a period of time, they shall be made consistently with the exchange
rate methodology applied in the financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum or delivered
pursuant to the covenant described under "—Reports" for the same period.

**Listing**

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited to list the Senior
Secured Notes on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and to admit the Senior Secured
Notes for trading on the Exchange. There can be no assurance that any such listing will be granted or
maintained.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer are located outside the United
States, any judgment obtained in the United States against the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, including
judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any
redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, may not be collectable
within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Secured
Notes Indenture and the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer
and the Guarantors will in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the

assumes, Guarantees, repays, repurchases, redeems, defeases or otherwise discharges any
Indebtedness or has caused any Reserved Indebtedness Amount to be deemed to be Incurred subsequent
to the commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and
on or prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio
is made (the "Calculation Date"), then the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio will be calculated giving pro
_forma_ effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer) to such Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; provided that (other than in connection with
making any Restricted Payment pursuant to clause (17) of the second paragraph of the covenant described
under "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted _Payments") the pro forma calculation shall not give_
effect to (i) any other Indebtedness Incurred or deemed Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to the

Calculation Date, or on the Calculation Date, will be given pro forma effect (including anticipated expense
and cost reductions and synergies as specified in the definition of "Consolidated EBITDA" and as
determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Senior Secured Notes
Issuer) as if they had occurred on the first day of the reference period; _provided_ that, if definitive
documentation has been entered into with respect to a Purchase that is part of the transaction causing a
calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated after giving pro
_forma_ effect to such Purchase (including anticipated expense and cost reductions and synergies as
specified in the definition of "Consolidated EBITDA") as if such Purchase had occurred on the first day of
such period, even if the Purchase has not yet been consummated as of the date of determination;

as determined in accordance with IFRS, or operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a
business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein), disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will
be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition had occurred on the first day of such period (taking
into account anticipated expense and cost reductions and synergies resulting from any such disposal as
specified in the definition of "Consolidated EBITDA" and as determined in good faith by a responsible
accounting or financial officer of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to Indebtedness owed by Persons that constitute
discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, or operations, businesses or group of
assets constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the
Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of
such period, but only to the extent that the Indebtedness giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense
will not be Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries following
the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed to have been
a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed not to have
been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such Indebtedness
will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been the applicable rate for the entire
period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement applicable to such Indebtedness); and

(7) if any Indebtedness is not denominated in sterling, that Indebtedness shall be converted into
sterling in the same way as it would be converted for balance sheet reporting purposes in accordance with
IFRS.

For the purposes of the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Income Taxes,
Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Net Income, calculations will be determined in
accordance with the terms set forth above.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES**

_You will find definitions of certain capitalised terms used in this "Description of the Senior Notes" under_
_the heading "Certain Definitions." For purposes of this "Description of the Senior Notes," references to the_
_"Senior Notes Issuer," "we," "our," and "us" refer only to Bellis Finco plc and not to any of its Subsidiaries._

The Senior Notes Issuer will issue £500 million aggregate principal amount of sterling-denominated
% Senior Notes due 2027 (the "Senior Notes") under an indenture, to be dated as of, 2021 (the
"Senior Notes Indenture"), between, _inter alios, the Senior Notes Issuer, Deutsche Trustee Company_
Limited, as trustee (the "Trustee"), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent (the "Security
**Agent"), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as paying agent, and Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. as**
transfer agent (the "Transfer Agent") and registrar (the "Registrar"), in a private transaction that is not
subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act. The Senior Notes Indenture will not be
qualified under, incorporate by reference or include terms of, or be subject to, any of the provisions of the
U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended.

The Senior Notes Indenture will be unlimited in aggregate principal amount. £500 million in aggregate
principal amount of Senior Notes will be issued in this offering. We may, subject to applicable law, issue
an unlimited principal amount of additional Senior Notes (the "Additional Senior Notes") of the same or
different series as the Senior Notes initially issued on the Issue Date, which shall have substantially
identical terms to the initial Senior Notes, except for certain terms which may be specifically distinguished
in an Officer's Certificate; _provided, that if the Additional Senior Notes are not fungible with the Senior_
Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Additional Senior Notes will be issued with a separate ISIN
code, Common Code or other securities identification number, as applicable, from the Senior Notes. We
will only be permitted to issue Additional Senior Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the
Senior Notes Indenture, including the covenants restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness and the
Incurrence of Liens (as described below under "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness" and
"—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens"). Except with respect to right of payment and optional
redemption, and as otherwise provided for in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes issued in this
Offering and, if issued, any Additional Senior Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under
the Senior Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments,
redemptions and offers to purchase. Unless the context otherwise requires, in this "Description of the
_Senior Notes," references to the "Senior Notes" include the Senior Notes and any Additional Senior Notes_
that are actually issued.

The Senior Notes Indenture will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreements (as defined below). The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement are
important to understanding the terms and ranking of the Senior Notes and the Liens on the Collateral
securing the Senior Notes. Please see "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor
_Agreement" for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._

The registered Holder of a Senior Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered
Holders will have rights under the Senior Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to
enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Notes have not been, and will not be, registered
under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions.

This "Description of the Senior Notes" is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the
Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms
of the Senior Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture
and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and
your rights. Copies of such documents are available from us upon request, and following the Issue Date,
copies of such documents will be made available upon request to holders of Senior Notes, as described in
more detail under "Listing and General Information."

**Acquisition Agreement; Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds**

Pursuant to the acquisition agreement dated October 2, 2020 (the "Acquisition Agreement") between
Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited, an indirect subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer formed for the
purpose of facilitating the Transactions (the "Purchaser"), and ASDA Holdings UK Limited, the Purchaser
agreed to acquire all of the issued ordinary shares of the Company.

We intend to settle the Offering on          , 2021 (the "Issue Date"), which we currently expect to
be after the date of consummation of the Acquisition (the "Completion Date"). In this case, on the
Completion Date, the Issuers are expected to draw £700 million (equivalent) in loans under the Senior
Bridge Facility and £1,400 million (equivalent) in loans under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, to fund
part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement. On the Issue Date, we will then use

379


-----

the proceeds of the offering of the Senior Notes together with the proceeds from the offering of the Senior
Secured Notes to repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Bridge Facility and the Senior Secured
Bridge Facilities. See "Use of Proceeds." In this case, on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be
obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer, the Company and ASDA Stores Limited (the "Initial Guarantors").

It is, however, possible that the Completion Date may be delayed until after the Issue Date, including
due to the timing of our receipt of the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. In this case, unless the Offering is
completed substantially concurrently with the Completion Date, we will fund the gross proceeds of the
Offering into escrow, as further described below and, on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be obligations
of the Senior Notes Issuer only and will not be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Initial
Guarantors until the Completion Date. In such circumstances, the Company and its Subsidiaries will
continue to be controlled by Walmart prior the Completion Date. We cannot assure you that Walmart will
operate ASDA's business during the interim period in the same way that the Senior Notes Issuer would
and we cannot assure you that, following the Completion Date, the Company will operate its business in
the same way that Walmart has operated the business in the past. As such, we cannot assure you that,
prior to the Completion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that would
otherwise have been prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture, had those covenants been applicable to
such entities after the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date.

If this Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the Acquisition, we will forego the escrow
procedures described above and will instead retain the proceeds of the Offering to fund part of the
consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement on the Completion Date. See "Use of Proceeds."

In any event, as contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition will be completed during
the pendency of the review of the Acquisition by the CMA, and the CMA's review remains ongoing. In
connection with its review of the Acquisition, the CMA is expected to issue an IEO, which we expect to
remain in force until the CMA Clearance Date. Under this IEO, neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any
Parent will be permitted to exercise control over the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise direct their
operations until the CMA Clearance Date. Accordingly, the Senior Notes Issuer and its Parents will not be
able to direct the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply with the covenants described in this "Description
_of the Senior Notes" until the CMA Clearance Date, and the Company and its material subsidiaries will_
have no contractual obligation to comply with these covenants until each of these entities accedes to
Senior Notes Indenture on the applicable date, which will be on or after the Completion Date.
Nevertheless, the covenants described herein will apply to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
from the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date, and any failure to comply with these covenants
will constitute a Default under the Senior Notes Indenture.

_Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption_

If the Offering is consummated prior to, and not substantially concurrently with or after, the Completion
Date, the Initial Purchasers will deposit, on the Issue Date, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds
of this offering and sale of the Senior Notes on the Issue Date into one or more escrow accounts (such
proceeds, the "Escrowed Proceeds" and such accounts, collectively, the "Escrow Accounts") pursuant
to the terms of one or more escrow agreements (each an "Escrow Agreement" and together, the "Escrow
**Agreements") to be dated as of the Issue Date among the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee and Deutsche**
Bank AG, London Branch (in such capacity, the "Escrow Agent").

The Escrowed Proceeds deposited in each of the Escrow Accounts will be held in the name of the
Senior Notes Issuer, but will be controlled by the Escrow Agent. The Escrowed Proceeds, and all other
funds and payments credited to the Escrow Accounts (less any property and/or funds released in
accordance with each Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the "Escrowed Property." The
Senior Notes Issuer's rights with respect to the Escrow Accounts, together with the Escrowed Property,
will be pledged in favour of the Trustee on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Holders of Senior Notes on
the Issue Date (such charges to be documented under one or more English law governed security
agreements (the "Escrow Account Charges") among the Senior Notes Issuer and the Trustee to be dated
on or before the Issue Date).

Under the terms of the Escrow Agreements, amounts may be released from the Escrow Accounts prior
to the Completion Date to pay accrued interest on the Senior Notes on any interest payment date in respect
thereof occurring prior to the Escrow Release Date.

Each Holder, by accepting a Senior Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms
and conditions of the applicable Escrow Agreement or Escrow Agreements, as applicable, and the Escrow
Account Charges and to have irrevocably authorised and directed the Trustee and the Escrow Agent to
take all actions set forth in the Escrow Agreements in the event it is executed without the need for further

380


-----

direction from them under the Senior Notes Indenture. Changes or other modifications to the Escrow
Agreements and the Escrow Account Charges can be made either with the consent of Holders of at least
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of Senior Notes then outstanding or
without the consent of Holders, if such changes or other modifications will not, individually or when taken
as whole, adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect.

_Release of Escrowed Proceeds in connection with the consummation of Acquisition_

In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to, or to pay it at the instruction
of, the Senior Notes Issuer (the "Release"), the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from
the Senior Notes Issuer, at a time that is on or before April 30, 2022 (the "Outside Date"), an Officer's
Certificate pursuant to each Escrow Agreement, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall
conclusively rely, without further investigation or verification, certifying that (i) as of the date of delivery of
such Officer's Certificate, there is no Event of Default under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the
heading titled "Events of Default" with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer, and (ii) the Acquisition has been
consummated or will be consummated reasonably promptly, and in no event later than three Business
Days, following the Release, in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement as in effect on the
date of this Offering Memorandum, except for any changes or other modifications to such terms to which
the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding have
consented or that will not, individually or when taken as whole, have a materially adverse effect on the
Holders.

Under the terms of each Escrow Agreement, the Release shall occur promptly upon the satisfaction of
the conditions set forth above (the date of such satisfaction, the "Escrow Release Date"). Upon any such
Release, the balance of the Escrow Accounts shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall
be released in accordance with each Escrow Agreement. Receipt by the Trustee of such Officer's
Certificate shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee to the release of the Escrowed Property from
the charges documented under the Escrow Account Charges.

_Special Mandatory Redemption_

Pursuant to one or more shortfall agreements (the "Shortfall Agreements") to be entered into on or
prior to the Issue Date between the Issuers and Bellis Midco Limited ("Midco"), a wholly owned subsidiary
of Topco and a Holding Company of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Midco
will be required to contribute to the Escrow Accounts and the corresponding escrow accounts for the Senior
Secured Notes, up to the maximum aggregate amount of £20.0 million, an amount in cash expected to
equal the sum of (i) interest accrued on the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes from the Issue
Date, and (ii) any Additional Amounts or corresponding additional amounts for the Senior Secured Notes,
in each case, to March 31, 2021 (the "Shortfall Agreement Termination Date"), which is the date by
which we expect to have received the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. A bank of international standing
(the "Issuing Bank") will guarantee Midco's obligations under the Shortfall Agreements by delivering to
the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, on the Issue Date, an irrevocable letter of
credit or on demand guarantee (the "On-Demand Guarantee") expiring on March 31, 2021. Pursuant to
the On-Demand Guarantee, each of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be
entitled to draw funds from the Issuing Bank to make up the relevant escrow shortfall, upon request made
no later than March 31, 2021 and up to the maximum aggregate amount of £20.0 million. If the Acquisition
and the Release have not occurred by March 31, 2021, Midco shall be entitled to extend the Shortfall
Agreement Termination Date unilaterally, at its discretion, by procuring that all of the following actions take
place: (a) Midco shall have increased its commitment to contribute cash to the Escrow Accounts and the
corresponding escrow accounts for the Senior Secured Notes under the Shortfall Agreements to an amount
expected to equal the sum of (i) interest accrued on the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes from
April 1, 2021, and (ii) any Additional Amounts or corresponding additional amounts for the Senior Secured
Notes, in each case, to a date chosen by Midco that is not later than the Outside Date, (b) the Issuing Bank
shall have increased its original commitment under the On-Demand Guarantee by the same amount set
forth in clause (a), and (c) the expiry date of the On-Demand Guarantee shall have been extended to, and
be the same as, the extended Shortfall Termination Date. The Senior Notes Issuer will promptly deliver
notice of any extension of the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent,
confirming that all actions described in the preceding clauses (a), (b) and (c) have been completed. Midco
may decide to extend the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date on one or more occasions, at its discretion,
up to (but no later than) the Outside Date under the Escrow Agreement. The Shortfall Agreements will
terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the Release.

In the event that (a) the Escrow Release Date does not take place on or prior to the Outside Date, (b)
in the reasonable judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated by the
Outside Date, (c) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Outside Date, (d) an

381


-----

Event of Default arises under clause (5) of the first paragraph under "—Events of Default" on or prior to
the Outside Date with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer, or (e) the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date
occurs on or prior to the Outside Date and at a time when the Escrow Release Date has not yet taken
place (the date of any such event being the "Special Termination Date"), the Senior Notes Issuer will
redeem all of the Senior Notes (the "Special Mandatory Redemption") at a price equal to 100% of their
respective aggregate issue price, plus accrued but unpaid interest from the Issue Date to the Special
Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and Additional Amounts, if any
(the "Special Mandatory Redemption Price").

If a Special Termination Date occurs, notices of the Special Mandatory Redemption will be delivered by
the Senior Notes Issuer to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent no later than two Business Days following
such date, and these notices will provide that the Senior Notes shall be redeemed on a date that is no later
than the fifth Business Day after such notice is given by the Senior Notes Issuer, in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreements (the "Special Mandatory Redemption Date"). Provided that the Escrow
Accounts are sufficiently funded, on a Special Mandatory Redemption Date, the Escrow Agent shall pay
to the Paying Agent for payment to each Holder the Special Mandatory Redemption Price for such Holder's
Senior Notes and, substantially concurrently with the payment to such Holders, deliver any excess
Escrowed Property to the Senior Notes Issuer.

**General**

_The Senior Notes_

The Senior Notes will:

     - be general senior obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer, secured as set forth under "—
_Security";_

     - rank pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future Indebtedness of the Senior
Notes Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes;

     - rank senior in right of payment to any future Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes;

     - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation (including
obligations to trade creditors) of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries that is secured
by property or assets that do not secure the Senior Notes (including the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility for so long as the Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets and
Substitute Retail Assets are held by the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries, and the
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, for so long as any Forecourt Disposal Receivable is held
by the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries) or that secure such Indebtedness on a priority
basis (including obligations in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Credit
Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and certain Hedging Obligations), to the
extent of the value of the property and assets securing such Indebtedness;

     - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness of the Subsidiaries of the
Senior Notes Issuer that are not Guarantors, including their obligations to trade creditors; and

    - be guaranteed, on the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date, on a senior
subordinated basis by the Initial Guarantors, and within 90 days of the Completion Date, on a
senior subordinated basis by each of McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood House
Group Limited (the "Post-Completion Guarantors" and, together with the Initial Guarantors,
the "ASDA Guarantors"), in each case, subject to the Agreed Security Principles and the
limitations described herein and in "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure,
_Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be_
_subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject_
_to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability"_ and "Certain Insolvency
_Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and_
_the Security Interests."_

_The Notes Guarantees_

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and, on the later of
the Issue Date and the Completion Date, will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Initial
Guarantors, subject to the Agreed Security Principles. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior
Notes Indenture will require the Senior Notes Issuer to cause the Senior Notes to be guaranteed on a
senior subordinated basis by the Post-Completion Guarantors (together with the Initial Guarantors, the

382


-----

"Guarantors") prior to the date falling 90 days after the Completion Date. In addition, if required by the
covenant described under "—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees," certain other Restricted
Subsidiaries may provide a Notes Guarantee in the future.

Each Notes Guarantee will:

     - be a general senior subordinated obligation of the applicable Guarantor;

     - be subordinated in right of payment to any existing and future senior Indebtedness of the
applicable Guarantor, including the Senior Secured Notes or such Guarantor's guarantee of
the Senior Secured Notes, as applicable, and Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior
Facilities Agreement or the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility;

    - rank _pari passu in right of payment with any existing and future senior subordinated_
Indebtedness of that Guarantor;

     - rank senior in right of payment to any existing or future Indebtedness of the applicable
Guarantor that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the applicable Notes
Guarantee;

     - be effectively subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the
applicable Guarantor that is secured by property or assets that do not secure the Notes
Guarantee (including the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility for so long as the
Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets are held by the Senior
Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries, and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, for so long as any
Forecourt Disposal Receivable is held by the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries) or that
secure such Indebtedness on a priority basis (including obligations in respect of the Senior
Secured Notes, the Senior Credit Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and certain
Hedging Obligations), to the extent of the value of the property and assets securing such
Indebtedness or obligation;

     - be structurally subordinated to any existing or future Indebtedness or obligation of the
Subsidiaries of the applicable Guarantor that are not Guarantors, including their obligations
to trade creditors; and

     - be subject to the limitations described herein and in "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our
_Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—Each Notes Guarantee and security_
_interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable_
_law or subject to certain defences that may limit its validity and enforceability" and "Certain_
_Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes_
_Guarantees and the Security Interests."_

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Notes Guarantees
to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit,
fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and
their respective shareholders, directors and general partners, and as further stipulated in the Agreed
Security Principles. For a description of such contractual limitations, see "Certain Insolvency
_Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security_
_Interests." By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be_
significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes. See also "Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—The insolvency laws of England_
_and Wales and other jurisdictions may not be as favourable to you as the_ _U.S. bankruptcy laws and may_
_preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes." Prior to the CMA Clearance_
Date, the CMA will have broad authority to maintain separation between the ASDA Group and the Bellis
Group, which could negatively affect the enforcement of the Notes Guarantees provided by the ASDA
Guarantors. See "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to
_certain uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes."_

**Subordination of the Notes Guarantees on the Basis of the Senior Indenture and the Intercreditor**
**Agreement**

Each of the Notes Guarantees is a senior subordinated Notes Guarantee, which means that, pursuant
to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Indenture, each such Notes Guarantee ranks
behind, and is expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the relevant
Guarantor, including any obligations owed by the relevant Guarantor under the Senior Secured Notes, the
Senior Credit Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, certain hedging arrangements and any other
Indebtedness ranking pari passu therewith incurred after the Issue Date. The ability to take enforcement

383


-----

action against any Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee is subject to significant restrictions imposed by
the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into after the
Issue Date.

In addition, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral are subject to release under certain circumstances,
including, but not limited to, certain enforcement actions taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction
of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is
likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor would recover disproportionately more than the
holders of the Senior Notes in any insolvency proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there
may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of, or interest on, the Senior Notes
after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness. The Notes Guarantees will also be subject to the
terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including payment blockage upon a senior default and standstill on
enforcement. See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement."

**Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries; Extraction of Warehouse Assets, Select**
**Retail Assets, balances credited to Designated Bank Accounts and, to the extent required,**
**Substitute Retail Assets**

As of the Issue Date, all of our Subsidiaries will be "Restricted Subsidiaries" for purposes of the Senior
Notes Indenture. However, under the circumstances described below under _"—Certain Definitions—_
_Unrestricted Subsidiary," we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as "Unrestricted_
Subsidiaries." Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the
Senior Notes Indenture.

On the Completion Date, entities within the ASDA Group entered into the ASDA Leases and granted
first-ranking mortgages, fixed charges or standard securities, as applicable, over certain Warehouse
Assets and Select Retail Assets and, to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility, certain Substitute Retail Assets, as well as first-ranking pledges over the Designated Bank
Accounts, in each case, to secure the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower's obligations
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. None of the lenders or the other secured parties
under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, the Senior Bridge Facility, the Senior Credit Facilities or the
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility benefit from any security interest in the Warehouse Assets, the Select
Retail Assets, the Substitute Retail Assets or the Designated Bank Accounts, and these assets will not be
pledged as collateral for the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes.

Following receipt of all regulatory approvals in connection with the Acquisition, the Senior Notes
Indenture will allow us to transfer the Warehouse Assets, balances credited to the Designated Bank
Accounts and, to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, the
Select Retail Assets and the Substitute Retail Assets to one or more Parents, in exchange for no
consideration or for consideration left outstanding in the form of one or more vendor loans. Upon
completion of the respective Post-Completion Disposals, the relevant assets will no longer be deemed
"Warehouse Assets," "Select Retail Assets" or "Substitute Retail Assets" under the Senior Notes Indenture
except in connection with the determination of what property constitutes "Material Real Property" and, in
the case of assets that constituted Select Retail Assets or Substitute Retail Assets (as applicable)
immediately prior to completion of the relevant Post-Completion Disposal, for purposes of the covenant
described under "Certain Covenants—Topco Covenant." Upon the completion of any Retail Assets
Contribution, the asset (or related Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds, as applicable) that is the subject of such
Retail Assets Contribution will no longer be deemed a "Select Retail Asset" or "Substitute Retail Asset" (as
applicable) under the Senior Notes Indenture (other than in connection with the determination of what
property constitutes "Material Real Property"). See "Description _of_ _Certain_ _Financing_
_Arrangements―Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility" for a description of the Distribution Asset_
Disposal Bridge Facility.

The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower intends to repay the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility primarily with the net proceeds from either sales of the Warehouse Assets subject to the
ASDA Leases or sale and leaseback transactions involving the Warehouse Assets. Depending on market
conditions and expected transaction values, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower may
also sell subject to the ASDA Leases or sell and lease back some or all of the Select Retail Assets and
Substitute Retail Assets, the net proceeds of which will also be applied to repay the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility. The Senior Notes Issuer is required to procure the return, by way of contribution
to its equity, Subordinated Shareholder Funding or repayment of Post-Completion Disposal Receivables
held by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, of any assets that constituted Select
Retail Assets or Substitute Retail Assets at the time of their distribution that are not sold by obligors under
the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility (whether by way of sales subject to the ASDA Leases, sale
and leaseback transactions or otherwise) and an amount equal to any Net Available Cash from the sale of

384


-----

such assets (including any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds) that have not been applied to repay or prepay
the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, in each case, promptly after the Distribution Asset Disposal
Bridge Facility has been discharged in full. See _"―Certain Covenants―Topco Covenant." For the_
avoidance of doubt, upon the contribution (including in the form of Subordinated Shareholder Funding) or
transfer to the Senior Notes Issuer (or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable) pursuant to a Retail
Assets Contribution of assets that, at the time of their distribution pursuant to a Post-Completion Disposal,
constituted Select Retail Assets or Substitute Retail Assets, such assets will cease to be Select Retail
Assets or Substitute Retail Assets (as applicable) and shall be fully subject to the terms of the Senior Notes
Indenture, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Facilities Agreement and (if any loans are outstanding
under such facility) the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement, in the same way as any other assets
of the Senior Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, except that such assets will remain excluded from
the definition of "Material Real Property."

**Principal and Maturity**

The Senior Notes Issuer will issue £500 million in aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes on the
Issue Date. The Senior Notes will mature on    , 2027 and will be issued in minimum denominations of
£100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

**Interest**

Interest on the Senior Notes will accrue at the rate of % _per annum. Interest on the Senior Notes_
will:

     - accrue from the Issue Date or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was most
recently paid;

     - be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on and, commencing on   ;

     - be payable to the holder of record of such Senior Notes on the Business Day immediately
preceding the related interest payment date (for Senior Notes held in global form); and

     - be computed on the basis of actual days elapsed in a 365-day year. The interest amount will
be calculated by applying the applicable rate of interest to the aggregate principal amount
outstanding under the Senior Notes.

Each interest period shall end on (but not include) the relevant payment date.

The rights of Holders to receive the payments of interest on the Senior Notes are subject to applicable
procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream.

**Methods of Receiving Payments on the Senior Notes**

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Global Senior Notes (as defined
below) will be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all
such payments with respect to the Senior Notes represented by one or more Global Senior Note registered
in the name of or held by a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, as applicable,
will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account specified by the Holder or
Holders thereof.

Principal, interest, premium and Additional Amounts if any, on any certificated securities, which shall
be in registered form for U.S. federal income tax purposes ("Definitive Registered Notes") will be payable
at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents maintained for such purposes. In addition,
interest on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by bank transfer to the person entitled thereto as
shown on the register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See "—Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer
_Agent for the Senior Notes."_

If the due date for any payment in respect of any Senior Notes is not a Business Day at the place at
which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due
until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or
other payment as a result of any such delay.

**Paying Agent, Registrar and Transfer Agent for the Senior Notes**

The Senior Notes Issuer will maintain one or more Paying Agents for the Senior Notes. The initial Paying
Agent will be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (the "Principal Paying Agent" or "Paying Agent").

The Senior Notes Issuer will also maintain a registrar (the "Registrar") and a transfer agent (the
"Transfer Agent"). The initial Registrar and Transfer Agent will be Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A. The
Registrar, Transfer Agent and Paying Agent, as applicable, will maintain a register reflecting ownership of
the Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to time, if any, and, together with the Transfer Agent,

385


-----

will make payments on and facilitate transfers of the Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the Senior
Notes Issuer.

The Senior Notes Issuer may change any Paying Agents, Registrars or Transfer Agents for the Senior
Notes without prior notice to the Holders of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of the Senior Notes.

**Notes Guarantees**

On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and, on the later of
the Issue Date and the Completion Date, will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Initial
Guarantors, subject to the Agreed Security Principles. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, subject
to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Notes Issuer will be required to cause the Post-Completion
Guarantors to Guarantee the Senior Notes on a senior subordinated basis prior to the date falling 90 days
after the Completion Date. As of October 20, 2020, the ASDA Guarantors held title to sites representing
99.9% of the aggregate capital pricing of the ASDA Store and Office Portfolio, as described in "Brokers'
_Opinions of Pricing." For the nine month period ended September 30, 2020, the ASDA Guarantors_
represented 99.9% of the Company's consolidated revenue.

The obligations of the Guarantors will be contractually limited under the applicable Notes Guarantees
to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit,
fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to the Guarantors and their respective
shareholders, directors and general partners, and as further stipulated in the Agreed Security Principles.
For a description of such contractual limitations, see "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital
_Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—The insolvency laws of England and Wales and other_
_jurisdictions may not be as favourable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the_
_Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes," "—Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will_
_be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain_
_defences that may limit its validity and enforceability," and "Certain Insolvency Considerations and_
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_ _Security Interests."_

The operations of the Senior Notes Issuer are and will be conducted through its Subsidiaries. Claims
of creditors of non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, including trade creditors, secured creditors and creditors
holding debt and guarantees issued by those Subsidiaries, and claims of preferred and minority
stockholders (if any) of those Subsidiaries generally will have priority with respect to the assets and
earnings of those Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors,
including Holders of the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes and each Notes Guarantee therefore will be
structurally subordinated to creditors (including trade creditors) and preferred and minority stockholders (if
any) of Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer (other than such Subsidiaries that are Guarantors).
Although the Senior Notes Indenture limits the Incurrence of Indebtedness by Restricted Subsidiaries, the
limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions. Moreover, the Senior Notes Indenture does not
impose any limitation on the Incurrence by Restricted Subsidiaries of liabilities that are not considered
Indebtedness under the Senior Notes Indenture. See "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Indebtedness"_
and "—Certain Definitions—Indebtedness."

In addition, as described below under "—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees" and
subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that
guarantees any Indebtedness Incurred under any Syndicated Term Facilities, any other Credit Facility that
provides for aggregate lending commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination
or any Public Debt shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Notes.

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favour of obligations
under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes and the Forecourt Disposal
Bridge Facility. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where,
among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or
requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference rules, "thin capitalisation"
rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, where the time and cost of
granting the guarantee or security would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders or where
security would be granted over the Capital Stock, liabilities, property or other assets of any member of the
Regulated Group.

Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor's
obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States
Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise stipulated under the
Agreed Security Principles, including to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws.
By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less

386


-----

than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation
under its Notes Guarantee. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and
_Our Indebtedness—Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on_
_enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defences that_ _may limit its validity_
_and enforceability," "—The insolvency laws of England and Wales and other jurisdictions may not be as_
_favourable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering_
_payments due on the Notes" and "Certain Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and_
_Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests."_

The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release:

(1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger)
of the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding
company) or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor
(other than to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by
the Senior Notes Indenture;

(2) upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture of the
Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary;

(3) upon becoming a member of the Regulated Group;

(4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior
Notes or upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of
the Senior Notes Indenture, as provided in "—Defeasance" and "—Satisfaction and
_Discharge";_

(5) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is
unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Credit
Facilities and (ii) does not guarantee any Syndicated Term Facility or any other Credit
Facility that provides for aggregate lending commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the
relevant date of determination or Public Debt;

(6) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement (including as described under "Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions Following an IPO");_

(7) as described under "—Amendments and Waivers";

(8) as described in the first paragraph of the covenant described below under "—
_Certain_ _Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees";_

(9) as a result of a transaction permitted by "—Certain Covenants—Merger and
_Consolidation—The Guarantors"; or_

(10) in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation.

Upon the request of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all
reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in
accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the
releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, upon
receipt of customary documentation under the Senior Notes Indenture and without the consent of the
Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee or the Security Agent.

**Transfer and Exchange**

The Senior Notes will be issued in global registered form without interest coupons, as follows:

     - Senior Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in
registered form without interest coupons attached (the "144A Global Senior Notes"). The
144A Global Senior Notes will, on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream.

     - Senior Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the Securities
Act will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Senior Notes" and, together with the 144A

387


-----

Global Senior Notes, the "Global Senior Notes"). The Regulation S Global Senior Notes will,
on the Issue Date, be deposited with and registered in the name of the nominee of the
common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Senior Notes ("Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons
that have accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such
participants.

Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the restrictions
on transfer and certification requirements summarised below and described more fully under "Notice to
_Investors." In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear or participants_
in Clearstream will be effected by Euroclear and Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and
subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their
respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Senior Notes (the "144A Book-Entry Interests") may be
transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global
Senior Notes (the "Regulation S Book-Entry Interests") only upon delivery by the transferor of a written
certification (in the form provided in the Senior Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being
made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of
144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided
in the Senior Notes Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the transferor
reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with any applicable state securities laws.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will,
upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Note from which it was transferred
and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly,
from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures
applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Senior Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of
£100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar
of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the
Senior Notes Indenture. It is expected that such instructions will be based upon directions received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, from the participant that owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests.
Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry Interest will, except as set forth in the
Senior Notes Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Senior Notes Issuer in compliance with
applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarised
below and described more fully under "Notice to Investors."

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Senior Notes issued as Definitive Registered
Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum denominations of £100,000 in
principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. In connection with any such transfer
or exchange, the Senior Notes Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among other
things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the
account of the transferee at Euroclear or Clearstream, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and
opinions, and to pay any Taxes in connection with such transfer or exchange. Any such transfer or
exchange will be made without charge to the holder, other than any Taxes payable in connection with such
transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Registrar and the Transfer Agent are not required to register the
transfer or exchange of any Definitive Registered Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of Senior Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Senior
Notes to be redeemed in part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any interest payment
date (which will be 15 days prior to the relevant interest date for Senior Notes held in
definitive registered form); or

(4) which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection
with a Change of Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

388


-----

The Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will be
entitled to treat the Holders of Senior Notes as the owners thereof for all purposes.

**Security**

_General_

If this Offering is settled prior to, and not substantially concurrently with or after, the Completion Date,
the gross proceeds of the offering of the Senior Notes will be deposited into the Escrow Accounts and the
Senior Notes will be secured by the Escrow Account Charges on the Issue Date.

On the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the
Senior Notes will be secured by (i) first-priority security interests over (a) the issued share capital of the
Senior Notes Issuer (the "Issuer Share Collateral"), (b) the Holdco Proceeds Loan and any other material
intercompany receivables owed by the Senior Notes Issuer to its direct Parent, Bellis Midco 4 Limited
("Holdco") and (c) the Senior Notes Issuer's material bank accounts located in England and Wales and (ii)
second priority security interests over (a) the issued share capital of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, and
(b) the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan and any other material intercompany receivables owing to the
Senior Notes Issuer by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (collectively, the "Collateral").

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under "—Certain
_Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest" and "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens," the Senior_
Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to grant security over the Collateral in
connection with future issuances of Indebtedness or Indebtedness of the Restricted Subsidiaries, including
any Additional Senior Notes issued by the Senior Notes Issuer as permitted under the Senior Notes
Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure,
_Our Financing and Our Indebtedness."_

Any other security interests that may in the future be granted to secure obligations under the Senior
Notes, any Notes Guarantees and the Senior Notes Indenture would also constitute "Collateral." All
Collateral will be subject to the operation of the Agreed Security Principles and any Permitted Collateral
Liens.

The security interests in the issued share capital of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior
Financing Proceeds Loan and any other material intra group receivables owing to the Senior Notes Issuer
by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (together, the "Shared Security") that will secure the Senior Notes on
a second priority basis will also secure the Senior Secured Notes and liabilities under the Senior Credit
Facilities, including the Revolving Credit Facilities, and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, as well as
certain Hedging Obligations, on a first priority basis, and the Shared Security may also secure certain future
indebtedness, including any Additional Senior Secured Notes, on a first priority basis. The proceeds from
the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the
Senior Notes. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes Guarantees, the Collateral and the Senior
_Notes Collateral—Risks Related to the Senior Notes—The ability of holders of Senior Notes to recover_
_under the pledge of the shares of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and other Shared Security may be_
_limited."_

No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Senior Notes. By
its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.
Accordingly, the Collateral may not be able to be sold in a short period of time, or at all. See "Risk Factors—
_Risks Related to the Notes Guarantees, the Collateral and the Senior Notes Collateral—Risks Related to_
_the Senior Notes—Claims of the Group's senior secured creditors and, if the Revolving Credit Facilities is_
_designated as a super senior liability in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, claims_
_in respect of any such Super Senior Liabilities will have priority with respect to their security over the claims_
_of Senior Notes holders, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness." Under the_
terms of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement, no security interest will be granted
to secure the Senior Notes in either the assets or the issued Capital Stock of any Subsidiary that is or
becomes part of our Regulated Group, and no Security Interests may be granted over any intercompany
receivables owed by or to members of the Regulated Group to or by the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary. Prior to the CMA Clearance Date, the CMA will have broad authority to maintain
separation between the ASDA Group and the Bellis Group, which could affect the enforcement of the
Collateral. See "Risk Factors—Risk Factors Related to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to
_certain uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes."_

_Priority_

The relative priority with regard to the security interests in the Collateral that are created by the Security
Documents (the "Security Interests") as between (a) the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement,

389


-----

(b) the lenders under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, (c) the counterparties under certain Hedging
Obligations, (d) the trustee, the security agent and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes under the
Senior Secured Notes Indenture and (e) the Trustee, the Security Agent and the Holders of the Senior
Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture, respectively, is established by the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the Additional Intercreditor Agreements
(if any) and the security documents relating to the Senior Facilities Agreement and such Hedging
Obligations. Such documents provide, among other things, that the obligations under the Senior Facilities
Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, certain Hedging Obligations and the Senior Secured
Notes will be secured by first-priority Security Interests in the Collateral and the obligations under the Senior
Notes will be secured by second-priority Security Interests in the Collateral. In addition, the Collateral may
be pledged to secure other Indebtedness, subject to the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. See "Description of Certain Financing
_Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement." In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional_
Intercreditor Agreements (if any) entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure
other Indebtedness. See "—Release of Liens," "—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest"
and "—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens."

_Enforcement of Security Interests_

The Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Trustee or the Holders of Senior Notes to
enforce the Security Interests and will provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the
Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under "Description of Certain
_Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement" and "Certain Insolvency Considerations and_
_Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests." The ability_
to enforce the Security Interests may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future
Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture and the
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Intercreditor Agreement will provide (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will provide) for
circumstances in which the Holders of the Senior Notes may instruct the Security Agent to take
enforcement action in respect of such Security Interests including if, among other things, a default under
the Senior Notes is continuing following the expiry of a Senior Notes enforcement standstill period (being
a period of up to 179 days), provided that (other than in the case of an event of default which has occurred
under the Senior Notes as a result of failure to pay principal at final maturity) no such enforcement action
may be taken against a debtor or any of its subsidiaries if enforcement action is being taken by the Security
Agent against that debtor in respect of Shared Security on the instructions of an instructing group which
the proposed Senior Notes enforcement action might reasonably be expected to adversely affect.

The restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement do not restrict the right of the Topco Notes Creditors
(as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to institute suit against the Senior Notes Issuer for the recovery
of any payment due by the Senior Notes Issuer in respect of the Senior Notes.

_Agreed Security Principles_

The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of Notes Guarantees and security in favour of
obligations under the Senior Notes and are substantially similar to the agreed security principles appended
to the Senior Facilities Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of
Notes Guarantees and security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general
statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules,
fraudulent preference rules, "thin capitalisation" rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims
and similar matters, where the time and cost of granting the guarantee or security would be
disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders or where security would be granted over the Capital
Stock, property or other assets, or liabilities of a member of the Regulated Group.

In this "Agreed Security Principles" section only, any reference to "Acquired Person or Asset,"
"Agent," "Debtor," "Finance Document," "Secured Debt Document," or "Secured Parties" is a
reference to that term as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date. See
"Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement."

General Principles

The guarantees and security required to be provided under the Secured Debt Documents will be given
in accordance with the security principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles. The description that
follows identifies the Agreed Security Principles and addresses the manner in which the Agreed Security
Principles will impact on and determine the extent and terms of the guarantees, including the Notes

390


-----

Guarantees, and security proposed to be provided under or pursuant to any Secured Debt Document,
including the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes and the Security Documents.

(a) The Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may
be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining effective or commercially reasonable
Notes Guarantees and/or security from all relevant members of the Group in each
jurisdiction in which it has been agreed that Notes Guarantees and security will be granted
by those members. In particular:

(i) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial
assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit,
fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, "transfer pricing," "thin capitalisation,"
"earnings stripping," "controlled foreign corporation" and other tax restrictions,
"exchange control restrictions," "capital maintenance" rules and "liquidity impairment"
rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval
requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to
provide a Notes Guarantee or security or may require that the Notes Guarantee or
security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the Notes Guarantee or
security will be limited accordingly, _provided_ that to the extent requested by the
Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the
relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring
material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to
overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such Notes Guarantee or Security
Document shall be subject to such limit;

(ii) a key factor in determining whether or not a Notes Guarantee or security
will be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or
registration) is the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes,
interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable
legal fees) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured
Parties of obtaining such Notes Guarantee or security;

(iii) members of the Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or
enter into Security Documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the
Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or
if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene
any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the
potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or
officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that, to the extent requested by
the Security Agent before signing any applicable Security Document or accession
document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but
without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third
parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such Notes Guarantee or
Security Document shall be subject to such limit;

(iv) Notes Guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of
notarial costs and all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of
security will not exceed an amount to be agreed between the grantor of the security
and the Security Agent;

(v) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial
assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate
to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material assets only;

(vi) it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical
to create security over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be
taken over such assets;

(vii) any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, licence,
instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or
regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the
asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable Security
Document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or
works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable
Security Document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend
any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in

391


-----

respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially
adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be
excluded from a Notes Guarantee or Security Document, provided that, reasonable
endeavours (exercised for a specified period of time and without incurring material
cost or instigating legal proceedings) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where
otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies prior
to the date of the security or accession document that the asset is material and the
Senior Notes Issuer is satisfied that such endeavours will not involve placing
relationships with third parties in jeopardy;

(viii) the giving of a Notes Guarantee, the granting of security and the registration
and/or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct
its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the
Senior Notes Indenture (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual
counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights,
benefits or obligations, in each case prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default
which is continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to
seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to
this clause (viii);

(ix) any Security Document will only be required to be notarised if required by
law in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence;

(x) no Notes Guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any
Acquired Person or Asset (and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect
thereto) which are required to support acquired indebtedness to the extent such
acquired indebtedness is permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture to remain
outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired
pursuant to an acquisition not prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture shall be
required to become a guarantor or grant security with respect to any Secured Debt
Document if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing that acquired
indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness or any Refinancing Indebtedness) or
if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to an obligation
(including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; no security will be
granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any permitted Indebtedness and/or
to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by the Senior
Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement;

(xi) to the extent possible and unless required by applicable law, there should
be no action required to be taken in relation to the Notes Guarantee or the Collateral
when any Holder assigns or transfers any of its Senior Notes to a new Holder (and,
unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the Senior Notes Indenture or any Security
Document, no member of the Group shall bear or otherwise be liable for any taxes,
any notarial, registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that
result from any assignment or transfer by a Holder);

(xii) (other than the Real Estate Reports) no title investigations or other diligence
on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required and any security shall
take subject to any matters registered against the title to the assets as at the date of
the relevant security or to which the security is otherwise legally subject;

(xiii) security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favour of
a third party (other than in relation to security under general business conditions of
account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the creation of Security Interests over
such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such
assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant Security Document);

(xiv) to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favour of the
Security Agent and not the Secured Parties individually (with the Security Agent to
hold one set of Security Documents for all the Secured Parties); "parallel debt"
provisions will be used where necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement
and not the individual Security Documents); no member of the Group will be required
to take any action in relation to any Notes Guarantees or security as a result of any
assignment or transfer by a Secured Party;

392


-----

(xv) Notes Guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets
of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of
the Group that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group;

(xvi) each Security Document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any
transaction not prohibited under the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement and the security granted under each Security Document entered into after
the Completion Date shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security
Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant Security Document and
creation of the relevant security;

(xvii) no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the
turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement;

(xviii) the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by
them at the relevant time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off
granted to them under the terms of the Secured Debt Documents prior to the
occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing;

(xix) no Notes Guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any "Excluded
Swap Obligations" defined in accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update
dated February 15, 2013 entitled "Swap Regulations' Implications for Loan
Documentation," and any update thereto by the LSTA;

(xx) other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection,
filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by
members of the Group; and

(xxi) no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject
to any security will be required to be prepared or provided to the Secured Parties (or
any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time), unless (i)
required for such documents to become effective or admissible in evidence and (ii)
an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing.

(b) Notwithstanding any term of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Security Document, no Senior Note, Notes Guarantee or other
obligation under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security
Document may be, directly or indirectly:

(i) guaranteed by a "controlled foreign corporation" (as defined in Section
957(a) of the Internal Revenue Code) that is owned by a member of the Group
that is a US Person (such entity owned by a member of the Group that is a US
Person, a "CFC") or by an entity (a "FSHCO") substantially all the assets of which
consist of equity interests (or equity interests and indebtedness) of one or more
CFCs, or guaranteed by a subsidiary of a CFC or FSHCO;

(ii) secured by any assets of a CFC, FSHCO or a subsidiary of a CFC or a
FSHCO (including any CFC or FSHCO equity interests held directly or indirectly
by a CFC or FSHCO);

(iii) secured by a pledge or other security interest in excess of 65% of the
voting equity interests (and 100% of the non-voting equity interests) of a CFC or
FSHCO; or

(iv) guaranteed by any subsidiary or secured by a pledge of or security interest
in any subsidiary or other asset, if it would result in material adverse US tax
consequences as reasonably determined by the grantor of the security or
Guarantor (as applicable) and the Trustee or any other Agent.

Guarantees

Subject to the guarantee limitations set out in the Senior Notes Indenture, each Notes Guarantee will
be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee for all liabilities of the Debtors under the Secured
Debt Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed Security Principles in
each relevant jurisdiction (references to "security" to be read for this purpose as including the Notes
Guarantees and guarantees provided pursuant to any other Finance Document). Security documents will
secure the guarantee obligations of the relevant security provider or, if such security is provided on a third

393


-----

party basis, all liabilities of the Debtors under the Secured Debt Documents, in each case in accordance
with, and subject to, the requirements of these Agreed Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction.

Governing law and scope of security

(a) No security or Notes Guarantees shall be required to be given by (or shares or
investments in) any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any
member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another member of the Group.

(b) The parties agree that the overriding intention, subject to clause (a) above, is for
security only to be granted by and shall be limited to:

(i) Holdco, on a limited recourse third party basis, in respect of the shares it
holds in the Senior Notes Issuer and all intercompany loans owed to it by the
Senior Notes Issuer;

(ii) the Senior Notes Issuer, on a first priority basis, in respect of the assets
described in (i)(c) of the first paragraph under the caption "—Security—General";
and

(iii) the Senior Notes Issuer, on a second priority basis, in respect of the assets
described in (ii) of the first paragraph under the caption "—Security—General,"

and that no other security shall be required to be given by any other member of the
Group or in relation to any other asset unless specifically requested or agreed to by the
Senior Notes Issuer (in its absolute discretion) (together, the "Overriding Principle").

(c) All security (other than share security) will be governed by the law of, and secure
only assets located in, the jurisdiction of incorporation of the applicable grantor of the
security and no action in relation to security (including any perfection step, further
assurance step, filing or registration) will be required in jurisdictions where the grantor of
the security is not incorporated. Share security over any subsidiary will be governed by the
law of the place of incorporation of that subsidiary. Any security over a structural
intercompany loan granted to the Senior Notes Issuer will be governed by the governing
law of such structural intra-group loan document.

(d) Notwithstanding any other terms of the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement, no security or Notes Guarantees shall be required to be granted by any
member of the Group that is not incorporated in the United Kingdom, any jurisdiction of
incorporation of a Material Subsidiary and any jurisdiction of incorporation of a borrower
under the Senior Facilities Agreement (each of the foregoing, a "Security Jurisdiction"),
other than security over shares in a Material Subsidiary granted by a member of the Group
that is not incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction.

Terms of security documents

The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any Security Documents:

(a) security will not be enforceable or crystallise until the occurrence of an Event of
Default which is continuing;

(b) the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at
the relevant time) will only be able to exercise a power of attorney following the occurrence
of an Event of Default which is continuing;

(c) the Security Documents should only operate to create security rather than to impose
new commercial obligations or repeat clauses in other Secured Debt Documents and
accordingly:

(i) they should not contain additional representations, undertakings or
indemnities (including, without limitation, in respect of insurance, information,
maintenance or protection of assets or the payment of fees, costs and expenses)
unless these are the same as or consistent with those contained in the other
Secured Debt Documents and are required for the creation or perfection of
security; and

(ii) nothing in any Security Document shall operate or be construed so as to
prohibit any transaction, matter or other step (or a grantor of security taking or
entering into the same) or dealing in any manner whatsoever in relation to any
asset (including all rights, claims, benefits, proceeds and documentation, and

394


-----

Bank accounts


contractual counterparties in relation thereto) the subject of (or expressed to be
the subject of) the security agreement if not prohibited by the terms of the Senior
Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (and accordingly to such extent,
the Security Agent shall promptly effect releases, confirmations, consents to deal
or similar steps always at the cost of the relevant grantor of the security);

(d) no security will be granted over parts, stock, moveable plant, equipment or
receivables if it would require labelling, segregation or periodic listing or specification of
such parts, stock, moveable plant, equipment or receivables;

(e) perfection will not be required in respect of (i) vehicles and other assets subject to
certificates of title or (ii) letter of credit rights and tort claims (or the local law equivalent);

(f) in no event shall control agreements (or perfection by control or similar
arrangements) be required with respect to any assets (including deposit or securities
accounts) (unless the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement expressly
provide for any specific account (by reference to its purpose) to be subject to specific
restrictions on use);

(g) security will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future
assets of the same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental
pledges or notices to be delivered in respect of future acquired assets in order for effective
security to be created over that class of asset, such supplemental pledges or notices will
be provided only upon request of the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the
Trustee or another Agent) and at intervals no more frequent than annually (unless required
more frequently under local law); and

(h) each Security Document must contain a clause which records that if there is a
conflict between the Security Document and the Finance Documents or the Intercreditor
Agreement then (to the fullest extent permitted by law) the provisions of the Finance
Documents or (as applicable) the Intercreditor Agreement will take priority over the
provisions of the Security Document.

(a) If a member of the Group grants security over its material bank accounts it will be
free to deal, operate and transact business in relation to those accounts (including opening
and closing accounts) until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing
(unless the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security
Documents expressly provide for any specific account (by reference to its purpose) to be
subject to specific restrictions on use). For the avoidance of doubt, (unless the Senior
Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents expressly provide
for any specific account (by reference to its purpose) to be subject to specific restrictions
on use) there will be no "fixed" security over bank accounts, cash or receivables or any
obligation to hold or pay cash or receivables in a particular account unless the principal of,
premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Notes have become
immediately due and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default which is
continuing.

(b) Where "fixed" security is required in accordance with paragraph (a) above, if
required by local law to perfect the security and it is possible to give such notice of security
without disrupting the operation of the account(s) in question, notice of the security will be
served on the account bank in relation to applicable accounts within 10 Business Days of
the date of the Security Document (or accession thereto) and the applicable grantor of the
security will use its reasonable endeavours to obtain an acknowledgement of that notice
within 20 Business Days of service. If the grantor of the security has used its reasonable
endeavours but has not been able to obtain acknowledgement or acceptance, its obligation
to obtain acknowledgement will cease on the expiry of that 20 Business Day period.
Irrespective of whether notice of the security is required for perfection, if the service of
notice would prevent any member of the Group from using a bank account in the course
of its business, no notice of security will be served unless the principal of, premium, if any,
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Notes have become immediately due
and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

(c) Any security over bank accounts will be subject to any security interests in favour
of the account bank which are created either by law or in the standard terms and conditions

395


-----

Real Property


of the account bank. No grantor of security will be required to change its banking
arrangements or standard terms and conditions in connection with the granting of bank
account security.

(d) If required under applicable local law, security over bank accounts will be registered
subject to the general principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no security shall be required to be granted
over, or in respect of, any Designated Bank Account.

(a) Except as contemplated by the Overriding Principle, there shall be no requirement
to grant any security over real property in the United Kingdom. There shall be no
requirement to grant security over real property not located in the United Kingdom.

(b) There shall be no restrictions in any Security Document restricting members of the
Group from transferring, leasing or otherwise disposing of real estate assets to other
members of the Group (other than, in respect of Material Real Property which is required
to comprise part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes
Indenture, security granted to other members of the Group, which shall be restricted in the
manner contemplated by the Senior Notes Indenture) or any third parties and, for the
avoidance of doubt, no consent or approval shall be required under any Security Document
from the Trustee or the Holders for any such transfers, leases or dispositions and the
Security Agent shall be authorised to release any security over any real estate assets and
provide such consent, approval or certificate that may be requested by any member of the
Group in relation to such transfers, leases or dispositions without the need for any further
consent or approval from the Trustee or the Holders to the extent the relevant transfer,
lease or disposition is not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(c) Where granting security over any real property would require obtaining consent
from a third party, there shall be no requirement to grant security (including floating security
to the extent such consent is required) over any such real property if such consent is not
obtained.

(d) Where granting security over any real property would require complying with or
satisfying a restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent)
in favour of a third party, the relevant member of the Group shall, in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture,
use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost, instigating legal
proceedings and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to comply with
or satisfy such restriction, inhibition or arrangement following which, if the restriction,
inhibition or arrangement in favour of the third party cannot be satisfied or complied with
or the third party has not provided any consent, approval, certificate or other
documentation required to register that security at HM Land Registry (or the relevant
jurisdictional equivalent), there shall be no requirement to grant security.

(e) Where granting security over any real property would require complying with or
satisfying a restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent)
in favour of or for the benefit of a third party that requires the Security Agent to enter into
any document pursuant to that restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant
jurisdictional equivalent), if the Security Agent declines to enter into such document or
requests modifications to the form of any such document (it being understood that the
Security Agent is not obliged to enter into any such documentation that is not agreed with
it and the Security Agent shall not be liable to any party for requesting modifications to the
form of any such document or declining to enter into such document (acting reasonably)),
there shall be no requirement to enter into negotiations regarding that document or to grant
security over that real property.

(f) Notwithstanding that a restriction, inhibition or arrangement has been satisfied or
complied with in accordance with paragraph (d) above, if a third party has not provided
any documentation or information required for dealing with any requisition raised by HM
Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) that results in an application being
cancelled, then no security shall be granted over that real property.

396


-----

(g) In relation to the Material Real Properties, where there is existing security registered
on the title at HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), there shall be no
requirement to apply for the removal of such registration unless such security was granted
in respect of financing obtained from another member of the Group, ASDA Holdings UK
Limited (the "Vendor") or any Affiliate of the Vendor or a financial institution, credit
institution, insurance broker or pension fund in their capacity as lenders.

(h) Where the Security Agent has the benefit of a restriction or inhibition (or the relevant
jurisdictional equivalent) on the title of a property, it shall provide its consent, approval,
certificate or release in the form required by HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional
equivalent), to allow any matter that is not prohibited under the Senior Notes Indenture or
the Intercreditor Agreement as soon as possible and in any event within 10 Business Days
of request by the Senior Notes Issuer accompanied by a certification by the Senior Notes
Issuer that such matter is not prohibited under the Senior Notes Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no security shall be required to be granted
over, or in respect of, any Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail
Assets.

Fixed assets

Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if a member of the Group grants security over its material
fixed assets it will be free to deal with those assets in the course of its business until the occurrence of an
Event of Default which is continuing. No notice, whether to third parties or by attaching a notice to the fixed
assets, will be prepared or given until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

Insurance policies

(a) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, a member of the Group may grant
security over its material insurance policies (excluding any third party liability or public
liability insurance and any directors and officers insurance in respect of which claims
thereunder may be mandatorily prepaid, provided that the relevant insurance policy allows
security to be so granted). Notice of any security interest over insurance policies will only
be served on an insurer of the Group assets upon written request of the Security Agent
(acting on the instructions of the Trustee or another Agent), which may only be given after
the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing.

(b) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing, no loss payee or
other endorsement will be made on the insurance policy and no Secured Party will be
named as co-insured.

Intellectual property

(a) No security will be granted over any intellectual property which cannot be secured
under the terms of the relevant licencing agreement.

(b) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if security is granted over the relevant
material intellectual property, the grantor shall be free to deal with, use, licence and
otherwise commercialise those assets in the course of its business (including allowing its
intellectual property to lapse if no longer material to its business) until the occurrence of
an Event of Default which is continuing.

(c) Notice of any security interest over intellectual property will only be served on a third
party from whom intellectual property is licensed upon written request of the Security
Agent, which may only be given after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is
continuing. No intellectual property security will be required to be registered under the law
of that Security Document, the law where the grantor is regulated, or at any relevant supranational registry. Security over intellectual property rights will be taken on an "as is, where
is" basis and the Group will not be required to procure any changes to, or corrections of
filings on, external registers.

Receivables

(a) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Guarantor grants security over any of its receivables it will be free to deal with, amend,
waive or terminate those receivables in the course of its business until the occurrence of
an Event of Default which is continuing. No notice of security may be prepared or served
until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing (other than security over

structural intra-group loans). Any list of receivables provided will not include details of the
underlying contracts (but may include non-sensitive generic information to the extent that
would allow for the creation of security) and will not be required to be updated after the
delivery of the first list by any Material Subsidiary. If required under local law, security over
receivables will be registered subject to the general principles set out in these Agreed
Security Principles.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no security shall be required to be granted
over, or in respect of, any Post-Completion Disposal Receivables.

(a) Security over shares, stocks or partnership interests will be limited to those over the
Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer.

(b) Until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the legal title of the shares
will remain with the relevant grantor of the security (unless transfer of title on granting such
security is customary in the applicable jurisdiction) and any grantor of share security shall
be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights and powers in relation to any shares
and other related rights charged by it and receive, own and retain all assets and proceeds
in relation thereto without restriction or condition, provided that any exercise of rights does
not materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Security Interest over the
shares or cause an Event of Default to occur.

(c) Where customary and applicable as a matter of law, on, or as soon as reasonably
practicable and after execution (and taking into account any stamping requirements in
respect of any stock transfer form (or applicable law equivalent)) of that security or
accession document, the applicable share certificate (or other documents evidencing title
to the relevant shares) and a stock transfer form executed in blank (or applicable law
equivalent) will be provided to the Security Agent.


Regulated Group

(a) No member of the Group shall be required to create security over, or otherwise
encumber the shares in or assets or liabilities of (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any
bank account, receivable or any other asset of another member of the Group which
corresponds to a liability of a member of the Regulated Group), any member of the
Regulated Group or any Unrestricted Subsidiary and no member of the Regulated Group
and no Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be required to become a Guarantor.

(b) If a member of the Group is or becomes a member of the Regulated Group, the
Security Agent and/or the relevant Secured Parties (as applicable) shall, at the cost and
request of the Senior Notes Issuer, promptly release any Collateral over the shares, assets
or liabilities of (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any asset of another member of the
Group which corresponds to a liability of such member of the Regulated Group) and Notes
Guarantees provided by, such member of the Regulated Group without further consent or
approval from the Trustee or the Holders.

_Security Documents_

Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure the payment
when due of the Senior Notes Issuer's payment obligations under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes
Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into among, inter alios, the relevant security provider
and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties.

The Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security Agent will have the
right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes.
The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents and the Senior Notes
Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent. As a consequence of such contractual provisions,
holders of the Senior Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral
securing the Senior Notes except through the Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture, who will
(subject to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide
instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral. Under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the
Senior Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the trustee under the Senior
Secured Notes Indenture, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the counterparties under certain
hedging agreements in relation to the Security Interests in favour of such parties.

398


-----

In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or
similar proceedings, the Security Interest created under the Security Documents or the rights and
obligations enumerated in the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement could
be subject to potential challenges. If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interest or the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders
might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents. See "Risk Factors—Risks
_Related to the Senior Notes" and "—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our_
_Indebtedness."_

_Intercreditor Agreement; Additional Intercreditor Agreements; Agreement to be Bound_

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that each holder of the Senior Notes, by accepting such Senior
Note, will be deemed to have:

(1) consented and agreed to the terms of the Security Documents, the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance with the
covenant described under "—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements"
(including, without limitation, the provisions providing for foreclosure and release of the
Collateral and authorizing the Security Agent to enter into the Security Documents on its
behalf) as the same may be in effect or may be amended from time to time in accordance
with its terms and authorised and directed the Security Agent to enter into the Security
Documents and to perform its obligations and exercise its rights thereunder in accordance
therewith,

(2) authorised the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, to enter into the
Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement and to be bound thereby, and

(3) have appointed and authorised the Security Agent and the Trustee to give effect to
the provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

See "Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement."

_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Senior Notes Issuer, in connection
with the Incurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any Indebtedness permitted
pursuant to the covenant described under "—Limitation on Indebtedness," the Senior Notes Issuer, the
relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of
such Indebtedness (or their duly authorised representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an "Additional
**Intercreditor Agreement") or a restatement, amendment or other modification of the existing Intercreditor**
Agreement on substantially the same terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less
favourable to the Holders), including containing substantially the same terms with respect to release of
Notes Guarantees and priority and release of the Security Interests; _provided_ that such Additional
Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in
the reasonable opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights,
protections, indemnifications or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Senior Notes
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Notes Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Senior Notes Issuer and without
the consent of Holders, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall from time to time enter into one or more
amendments to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to any such agreement (including with respect to the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the addition of provisions relating to new
Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Senior Notes), (3) add Restricted Subsidiaries to the
Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further secure the Senior Notes
(including Additional Senior Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to
secure Additional Senior Notes, (6) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (7) amend the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, or (8) make
any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect.
The Senior Notes Issuer shall otherwise be entitled to direct the Trustee or the Security Agent to enter into
any amendment or waiver of any provision of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement, or take any action for which instructions of Holders are required under the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, with the consent of the Holders of the
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained
in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, the Senior Notes), unless the Senior

399


-----

Notes Issuer is entitled to request such amendment, waiver or action without the consent of Holders in
accordance with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture described below under "—Amendments and
_Waivers;"_ _provided that the Senior Notes Issuer may only direct the Trustee and the Security Agent to_
enter into any amendment or waiver or take any action to the extent such amendment, waiver or action
does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or Security Agent or, in the reasonable opinion
of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights, protections, indemnifications
or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, in relation to the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee (and Security Agent, if applicable) shall consent on behalf
of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Senior Notes thereby; _provided,_ _however, that such_
transaction would comply with the covenant described under "—Limitation on Restricted Payments."

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide further that each Holder, by accepting a Senior Note, shall be
deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement or any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into in the future pursuant to the
provisions described herein) and to have directed the Trustee and the Security Agent to enter into any
such Additional Intercreditor Agreement. A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement shall be made available for inspection during normal business hours on any
Business Day upon prior written request at our offices or at the offices of the listing agent.

_IPO Debt Pushdown_

On, in contemplation of, or following, an Initial Public Offering, the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement
(and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) will provide (and the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior
Notes shall be subject to such provisions) that the Senior Notes Issuer or its successor shall be entitled to
require (by written notice to the Trustee and the Security Agent) that the terms of the Senior Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and the Security
Documents shall operate (with effect from the date specified in such notice) as described under
"Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions Following an IPO."
The Trustee and the Security Agent shall be required to enter into any amendment to the Senior Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) and/or the Security
Documents required by the Senior Notes Issuer and/or take such other action as is required by the Senior
Notes Issuer in order to facilitate or reflect any of the matters contemplated by this paragraph, provided
that any such amendment or action will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security
Agent, or, in the opinion of the Trustee or the Security Agent, as applicable, adversely affect the rights,
protections, indemnifications, or immunities of the Trustee or the Security Agent under the Senior Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. See "Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—There are circumstances_
_other than repayment or discharge of the Notes under which the Collateral securing the Notes and the_
_Notes Guarantees will be released automatically and under which the Notes Guarantees will be released_
_automatically, without your consent or the consent of the relevant Trustee."_

_Release of Liens_

The Escrow Account Charges may be released in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreements
and the Escrow Account Charges. See "—Acquisition Agreement; Timing of Completion Date and Issue
_Date; Escrow of Proceeds."_

The Senior Notes Issuer, its Subsidiaries and any provider of Collateral will be entitled to the release of
the Security Interest in respect of the Collateral under any one or more of the following circumstances:

(1) in connection with any sale or other disposition of Collateral (other than the Security
Interest in respect of the Issuer Share Collateral) to (a) a Person that is not the Senior Notes
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (but excluding any transaction subject to "—Certain
_Covenants—Merger and Consolidation"), if such sale or other disposition does not violate the_
covenant described under "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
_Subsidiary Stock" or is otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture or_
(b) any Restricted Subsidiary, provided that this clause 1(b) shall not be relied upon in the
case of a transfer of Capital Stock or loan receivables to a Restricted Subsidiary (except to a
Securitisation Subsidiary) unless the relevant property and assets remain subject to, or
otherwise become subject to a Lien in favour of the Holders following such transfer, sale or
disposal;

400


-----

(2) in the case of a Guarantor that is released from its Notes Guarantee pursuant to the
terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock,
of such Guarantor;

(3) upon becoming a member of the Regulated Group, the release of the property and
other assets, and Capital Stock, of such member of the Regulated Group, and upon the
borrower under an intercompany loan becoming a member of the Regulated Group, the
release of any Security Interest in any receivables under such intercompany loan;

(4) in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Significant Subsidiary following
the release of its Lien granted in favour of the Senior Facilities Agreement, so long as no
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the release of the property and assets, and
Capital Stock, of such Restricted Subsidiary; provided that, there is no other Indebtedness
secured by a Lien on the assets of such Restricted Subsidiary that would result in the
requirement for the Senior Notes and the Notes Guarantees to be secured on such property,
assets or Capital Stock pursuant to the covenant described under "—Certain Covenants—
_Limitations on Liens";_

(5) as described under "—Amendments and Waivers";

(6) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior
Notes or upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the
Senior Notes Indenture, as provided in "—Defeasance" and "—Satisfaction and Discharge";

(7) if the Senior Notes Issuer designates any Restricted Subsidiary to be an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Notes
Indenture, the release of the property and assets, and Capital Stock, of such Unrestricted
Subsidiary;

(8) upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event as described under "—Certain
_Covenants— Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status";_

(9) in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation;

(10) as otherwise permitted in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture;

(11) in the case of the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan or any other material
intercompany receivables owed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries to the Senior Notes Issuer, upon their contribution to the equity of the Senior
Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiaries following the Completion Date;

(12) in the case of the Holdco Proceeds Loan or any other Proceeds Loan, upon their
contribution to the equity of the Senior Notes Issuer following the Issue Date; or

(13) in the case of the Forecourt Assets, to the extent mortgaged or charged to secure the
Senior Notes, any Notes Guarantees or the Senior Notes Indenture, in connection with any
Forecourt Assets Separation.

In addition, the Security Interest created by the Security Documents will be released (a) in accordance
with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including as described under
"Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement— Provisions Following an IPO")
and (b) as may be permitted by the covenant described under "—Certain Covenants—Impairment of
Security Interest."

At the request of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Security Agent and the Trustee (if required) will take all
necessary action reasonably required to effectuate any release of Collateral securing the Senior Notes and
the Notes Guarantees, in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the relevant Security Document, subject to
customary protections and indemnification. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the
Security Agent without the consent of the Holders or any action on the part of the Trustee. The Trustee
and the Security Agent shall be entitled to request and rely solely upon an Officer's Certificate and Opinion
of Counsel, each certifying which circumstance, as described above, giving rise to a release of the
Collateral has occurred, and that such release complies with the Senior Notes Indenture.

**Optional Redemption**

_Senior Notes_

Except as described below and except as described under "—Redemption for Taxation _Reasons," the_
Senior Notes are not redeemable until, 2023. On and after    , 2023, the Senior Notes Issuer may
redeem all or, from time to time, part of the Senior Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days'
notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued
and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts (as defined below), if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date), if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on
of the years indicated below:

**Redemption**
**Year** **Price**

2023 ................................................................................................................. %

2024 ................................................................................................................. %

2025, and thereafter ......................................................................................... 100.000%

Prior to              2023, the Senior Notes Issuer may, on one or more occasions, redeem up to
40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes (including the principal amount of any Additional
Senior Notes), upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice, with funds in an aggregate amount
not exceeding the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Equity Offerings at a redemption price of % of the
principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts,
if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); provided that:

(1) at least 50% of the original principal amount of the Senior Notes (including the
principal amount of any Additional Senior Notes) remains outstanding immediately after each
such redemption; and

(2) the redemption occurs within 180 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

In addition, prior to              2023, the Senior Notes Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time,
a part of the outstanding Senior Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium
and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable
redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest
due on the relevant interest payment date).

_Tender Offers_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Senior Notes
(including, without limitation, any Change of Control Offer and any Asset Disposition Offer), if Holders of
Senior Notes of such series of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Notes in such tender offer and the
Senior Notes Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Senior Notes Issuer,
purchases all of the Senior Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, all
of the holders of the Senior Notes of such series will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other
offer and, accordingly, the Senior Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10
nor more than 60 days' prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration
date, to redeem the Senior Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part (subject
to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest
payment date) following such purchase at a price equal to the price (excluding any early tender fee) offered
to each other Holder of Senior Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender
offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such
redemption date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of
the then-outstanding Senior Notes of any series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such
Senior Notes in a tender offer, Senior Notes owned by the Senior Notes Issuer or its Affiliates or by funds
controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be
deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer.

402


-----

_General_

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under "—Selection and Notice" below.

Except for a redemption pursuant to "—Redemption for Taxation Reasons," any redemption may, in the
Senior Notes Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent. If such
redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in
the Senior Notes Issuer's discretion, the redemption date may be delayed or extended until such time as
any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such redemption may not occur and such notice
may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived
by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed, in each case, as so notified by the Senior
Notes Issuer to the Holders; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 or
more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs except that redemption
notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection
with a defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture. In
addition, the Senior Notes Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and
performance of the Senior Notes Issuer's obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed
by another Person, and such notice of redemption may be extended if such conditions precedent have not
been satisfied or waived by the Senior Notes Issuer by notice to the Holders; provided that in no case shall
the notice have been delivered less than 10 or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such
redemption (if any) occurs except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a
redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction
and discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest
payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior Note
is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to
Holders whose Senior Notes will be subject to redemption by the Senior Notes Issuer.

If requested in writing by the Senior Notes Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable
notice of redemption or pursuant to the applicable Officer's Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or
such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall
distribute any amounts deposited with the Trustee, Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated
or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) to the Holders prior to the applicable redemption
date, provided, however, that Holders shall have received at least three Business Days' notice from the
Senior Notes Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For
the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable redemption date as
set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other
premium on such amounts. To the extent the Senior Notes are represented by a Global Senior Note
deposited with a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding
Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable
procedures of such clearing system.

_Selection and Notice_

If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar
(as applicable) will select Senior Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Senior Notes
issued as Global Senior Notes, based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection
(such as by way of pool factor) in accordance with the then applicable procedures of the relevant clearing
system), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange, clearing system or depositary
requirements; provided, however, that no Senior Note of £100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less
shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Notes in integral multiples of £1,000 will be redeemed. Neither
the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with
this paragraph.

If any Senior Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior
Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive
Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of
any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon
cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Senior Note, redemption will
be effected in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system (including by application of
a pool factor) or an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Senior Note to decrease the principal
amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the
applicable redemption notice, Senior Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for
redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Senior Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of

403


-----

the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Notes or portions of Senior Notes called for
redemption.

_Sinking Fund_

The Senior Notes Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund
payments with respect to the Senior Notes, except as described under "—Acquisition Agreement; Timing
_of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds."_

_Redemption at Maturity_

On, 2027, the Senior Notes Issuer will redeem the Senior Notes that have not been previously
redeemed or purchased and cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

_Redemption for Taxation Reasons_

The Senior Notes Issuer may redeem any series of Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time
upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holders of the relevant series of
Senior Notes (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a "Tax
**Redemption Date") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest**
due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under "—
_Withholding Taxes"), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date, as a result_
of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Senior Notes Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result
of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols
or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below)
affecting taxation; or

(2) any amendment to, or change in an official application or interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court
of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice)

(each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a "Change in Tax Law"), a Payor (as defined below) is, or
on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of Senior Notes would be, required to
pay Additional Amounts with respect to such series of Senior Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only
if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Senior Notes Issuer or another
Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and such
obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable); provided
that changing the jurisdiction of the Senior Notes Issuer is not a reasonable measure for purposes of this
section. Such Change in Tax Law must be announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or
if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the
Issue Date, such later date).

The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor
Person becomes a party to the Senior Notes Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring
after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Notes Indenture.

Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described
under "—Selection and Notice." Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given
(a) earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such
payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such
Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any
series of Senior Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an
Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts
showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of
an independent tax counsel of recognised standing to the effect that the Senior Notes Issuer has been or
will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will
accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the
satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event
it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

_Open Market Purchases, Privately Negotiated Transactions, Tender Offers_

As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Permitted Holders, their
respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our
outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Senior Notes or derivative instruments related thereto,
in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable
limitations contained in the agreements governing our Indebtedness, including the Senior Notes Indenture,
any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of
new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in
any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases
may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant
reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by or on behalf of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor (each, a "Payor") in
respect of the Senior Notes or with respect to any Notes Guarantee, as applicable, will be made free and
clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any
Taxes imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Senior Note is made
by or on behalf of a Payor, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or
therein having the power to tax; or

(2) any other jurisdiction in which a Payor is organised, engaged in business for tax
purposes, or otherwise considered to be a resident for tax purposes, or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax

(each of clause (1) and (2), a "Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction"),

will at any time be required by law to be made from any payments made by or on behalf of the Payor with
respect to any Senior Note, including payments of principal, redemption price, interest or premium, if any,
the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional amounts (the "Additional Amounts") as
may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by each Holder in respect of such payments,
after such withholding or deduction (including any such deduction or withholding from such Additional
Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which would have been received by such Holder in respect of
such payments on any such Senior Note in the absence of such withholding or deduction; _provided,_
_however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present
or former connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of the Senior Notes
(or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or
possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee,
trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen
or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent
establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction), but
excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or
holding of such Senior Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement
of rights under such Senior Note, the Senior Notes Indenture or a Notes Guarantee;

(2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of the Senior Note to comply with a written request of the Payor (or its
agent) addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such
withholding would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other
evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial
owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement
relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative
practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or
reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, all or part of such Tax but, only to the
extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or
documentation;

(3) any Taxes, to the extent that such Taxes were imposed as a result of the
presentation of the Senior Note for payment (where presentation is required) more than
30 days after the relevant payment is first made available for payment to the Holder, except

405


-----

to the extent the relevant Holder would have been entitled to an Additional Amount on
presenting the same for payment on such thirtieth day assuming that day to have been a
relevant payment date;

(4) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment under or
with respect to the Senior Notes or any Notes Guarantee;

(5) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax,
assessment or other governmental charge;

(6) any Taxes imposed in connection with a Senior Note presented for payment by or
on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would have been able to avoid such Tax by
presenting the relevant Senior Note to, or otherwise accepting payment from, another
Paying Agent (where there is such a Paying Agent);

(7) any Taxes that are imposed, deducted or withheld pursuant to Sections 1471
through 1474 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code") as of
the Issue Date, or any amended or successor version of such sections that are
substantively comparable, any current or future regulations promulgated thereunder, any
official interpretations thereof, any similar law or regulation adopted pursuant to an
intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and the United States with
respect to the foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 1471(b)(1) of
the Code; or

(8) any combination of the items (1) through (7) above.

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a
partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of the Senior Notes, to the extent that the
beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner
would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial
owner held such Senior Notes directly.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all
reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so
deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such
certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor's reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax
receipts are not obtained, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as
reasonably practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Such copies shall be made available to the
Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any
Senior Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 45 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will
deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts
will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable
the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such
obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which
case the Payor may deliver such Officer's Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 45
days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely, without
further inquiry, on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

Wherever in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes or this "Description of the _Senior Notes"_
there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices in connection with a
redemption of Senior Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the
Senior Notes or any Notes Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional
Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect
thereof.

The Payor will pay (and will indemnify the Holder for) any present or future stamp, issue, registration,
court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or
additions to tax) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any
related interest, penalties or additions to tax) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution,
delivery or registration of any Senior Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Senior Notes Indenture or any other
document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the
Senior Notes after this Offering) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto or any such taxes or
similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) imposed by any
jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the Senior Notes or any Notes

406


-----

Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of any such taxes or similar charges or levies attributable to the
receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (7) above or any combination thereof).

The foregoing obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Senior Notes
Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor to a Payor is organised,
engaged in business for tax purposes or otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or
through which any payment under, or with respect to the Senior Notes is made by or on behalf of such
Payor, or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

**Change of Control**

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes
a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer has previously or substantially
concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Notes as
described under "—Optional Redemption," the Senior Notes Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of
the Senior Notes (provided that Senior Notes of £100,000 or less may only be tendered and repurchased
in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the "Change of Control Offer"), at a price
in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and
Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase (the "Change of Control Payment");
_provided_ that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding
interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Senior Notes are registered at the close of
business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any
Change of Control, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change
of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream
or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing
in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and
offering to repurchase the Senior Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice
(the "Change of Control Payment Date"), which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than the
later of (x) 60 days from the date such notice is delivered and (y) the date of completion of the Change of
Control, pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior Notes Indenture and described in such notice,
except, in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control, as
described below.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior Notes
Issuer will, to the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Senior Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant
to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control
Payment in respect of all Senior Notes so tendered;

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent an
Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes or portions of the
Senior Notes being purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Senior Notes, unless notation of the purchase of Senior Notes
is to be effected in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system, deliver,
or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent the Global Senior Notes, in order to
reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered
to and purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the
relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by
the Senior Notes Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder
of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Notes, and the
Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Senior Notes Issuer, promptly authenticate and
mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new
Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes
surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Note will be in a principal amount that is at least
£100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Notes Indenture does not
contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem

407


-----

the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalisation or similar transaction. The existence of a
Holder's right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase such Holder's Senior Notes upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Notes Issuer
or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control.

The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of
Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in
compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control
Offer made by the Senior Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn
under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Notes has been
given pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture as described under "—Optional Redemption," unless and
until there is a default in the payment of the applicable redemption price on the applicable redemption date
or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the
applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of
Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control; provided, however, that such Change of
Control Offer is conditional upon such Change of Control.

The Senior Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of
the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior
Notes pursuant to this covenant. The Senior Notes Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the
SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer
satisfies certain conditions. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change
of Control provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

The Senior Notes Issuer's ability to repurchase Senior Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of
Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of events that constitute a Change of
Control would result in Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal
Bridge Facility becoming immediately due and payable or subject to a mandatory prepayment. Future
Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events
that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change
of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to
repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness,
even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior
Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior Notes Issuer's ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may
be limited by the Senior Notes Issuer's then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that
sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See "Risk Factors—
_Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—We may not have the ability_
_to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior_
_Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by each_
_Indenture."_

The definition of "Change of Control" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and
assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other
Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase "substantially all," there is no
precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of "substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to
whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Notes Issuer to
make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer's obligation to make
an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with
the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

_Limitation on Indebtedness_

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any
Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Senior Notes Issuer and any
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if on the date of such
Incurrence and after giving _pro forma_ effect thereto (including _pro forma_ application of the proceeds
thereof) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries would
have been at least 2.0 to 1.0.

("Permitted Debt"):

of credit or bankers' acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness, in a
maximum aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding not exceeding the sum of:

(i) £3,185 million,

(ii) £690 million,

(iii) the greater of (x) £1,200 million and (y) 100% of Consolidated EBITDA, and

held by any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor (except in respect of intercompany

Subsidiaries), such Indebtedness shall be unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Senior Notes,

Guarantor, in each case to the extent required by the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement; and

be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness not permitted by
this clause (3) by the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness:

(a) represented by the Senior Notes issued on the Issue Date, the Senior Bridge Facility,

£1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant or (B) the
Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio for the Senior Notes Issuer would not be less than it was
immediately prior to giving effect to such acquisition or other transaction and to the related

paragraph of the covenant described below under "—Limitation on Restricted Payments" to
the extent the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries Incur Indebtedness in
reliance thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be
excluded for purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) to the extent the
Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under
the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the second paragraph of the covenant
described below under "—Limitation on Restricted Payments" in reliance thereon;

(14) Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount which, when taken together with any
Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof and the principal amount of all other
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (14) and then outstanding, will not exceed the
aggregate amount of Restricted Payments that the Senior Notes Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries would otherwise not be prohibited from making at such time pursuant to the first
paragraph and clauses (10) and (11) of the second paragraph under "—Limitation on
_Restricted Payments"; provided, however, that the Incurrence of Indebtedness pursuant to_
this clause (14) shall reduce the amount available for making Restricted Payments pursuant
to the first paragraph under "—Limitation on Restricted Payments" or clauses (10) or (11) of
the second paragraph under "—Limitation on Restricted Payments," as applicable, by an
amount equal to the aggregate outstanding principal amount of such Indebtedness;

(15) Indebtedness under daylight borrowing facilities Incurred in connection with
refinancing transactions or any refinancing of Indebtedness (including by way of set-off or
exchange) so long as any such Indebtedness is repaid within three Business Days of the date
on which such Indebtedness is Incurred;

(16) Indebtedness consisting of local lines of credit or working capital facilities in an
aggregate principal amount not exceeding the greater of £360 million and 30.0% of
Consolidated EBITDA at any time outstanding; and

412


-----

(17) Indebtedness in connection with Investments in Associates or joint ventures not
exceeding, at any time outstanding, the greater of £240 million and 20% of Consolidated
EBITDA.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate principal amount of Indebtedness Incurred by Restricted
Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant and clause (11) of the
second paragraph of this covenant at any time outstanding shall not exceed the greater of £600 million
and 50% of Consolidated EBITDA.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of
Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Senior Notes
Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of
Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness (or
any portion thereof) in one or more of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first
paragraph of this covenant; provided that any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (7),
(11), (12)(b), (16) and (17) of the second paragraph of this covenant shall cease to be deemed
Incurred or outstanding pursuant to such clauses and shall be deemed Incurred and
outstanding pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on
which the Senior Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, could have
Incurred such Indebtedness thereunder (to the extent the Senior Notes Issuer or its Restricted
Subsidiaries, as applicable, are able to reclassify or Incur any Liens securing such
Indebtedness under the covenant described under "—Limitation on Liens" after such
reclassification, if applicable);

(2) (A) Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Indebtedness
outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities (after giving effect
to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom) in an
aggregate principal amount of up to the Sterling Equivalent of £2,250 million, and (B)
Indebtedness outstanding on the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date under the
Senior Credit Facilities (after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the
use of proceeds therefrom) in an aggregate principal amount of up to the Sterling Equivalent
of £935 million shall, in each case, be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1)(i) of the
second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(c) of the second
paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances,
letters of guarantee, bank guarantees, bankers' acceptances, performance guarantees,
performance bonds, demand guarantees, warranty guarantees, warranty bonds, bond
sureties, payment bonds or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing,
Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of
Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, letters of
guarantee, bank guarantees, bankers' acceptances, performance guarantees, performance
bonds, demand guarantees, warranty guarantees, warranty bonds, bond sureties, payment
bonds or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being
treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (13), (14), (16) or (17) of the second
paragraph above or the first paragraph above and such instruments relate to other
Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of Indebtedness represented by any Disqualified Stock of the
Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary,
will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not
including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference
thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference
to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such
provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such
Indebtedness;

413


-----

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount
thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis
of IFRS; and

(8) in the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or
increases commitments to Incur Indebtedness or any Lien pursuant to clauses (10), (28), (30)
or (31) of the definition of "Permitted Liens" or any Permitted Collateral Lien, the Incurrence
thereof for all purposes under the Senior Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, for
purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage
Ratio, as applicable, will, at the Senior Notes Issuer's option, either (a) be determined on the
date such commitments are entered into or increased pursuant to binding documentation or
(b) be determined on the date such Indebtedness or Liens are Incurred. If the Senior Notes
Issuer elects to test Incurrence as described in sub-clause (a), the full amount of Indebtedness
made available under such commitments (the "Reserved Indebtedness Amount"), and the
related Liens, will be deemed Incurred on the date of execution of such binding documentation
and, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or any other
Indebtedness or Lien Incurrence test under the Senior Notes Indenture is satisfied with
respect thereto at such time, any borrowing, re-borrowing or issuance of letters of credit,
bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments thereunder will be permitted under this
covenant and under the covenant described under "—Limitation on Liens," irrespective of
whether the same Incurrence test is met at the time of actual borrowing, re-borrowing or
issuance of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments thereunder.
The Senior Notes Issuer may revoke such election at any time and from time to time.

Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation
of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of
dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of
commitments or obligations initially not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be
deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this "—
_Limitation on Indebtedness." Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding_
as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original
issue discount or (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other
Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this "—
_Limitation on Indebtedness," the Senior Notes Issuer will not be permitted to designate such Unrestricted_
Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary and any such designation will not be deemed operative under the
Senior Notes Indenture).

For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another
currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
Indebtedness was Incurred or, at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, first committed pursuant to binding
documentation; _provided_ that, (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness
denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable sterlingdenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on
the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been
exceeded, so long as the principal amount (or, if issued with original issue discount, the aggregate issue
price) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition
of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness
outstanding on the Issue Date or Incurred in connection with the Acquisition Transactions on the
Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on either the
Issue Date or the Completion Date, as applicable; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in
a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the pound sterling) covering
principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling
will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed
to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount
of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the
Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the

414


-----

currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such
refinancing.

Neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted
Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Guarantor unless (a) in the case of the Senior Notes Issuer, such Indebtedness is also
contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes on substantially identical terms, or (b)
in the case of any Guarantor, such Indebtedness is pari passu in right of payment with or contractually
subordinated to such Guarantor's Notes Guarantee on substantially identical terms; _provided, however,_
that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other
Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue
of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue
of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of
Indebtedness.

_Limitation on Restricted Payments_

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or
indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in

measured by value); and

(c) dividends or distributions payable to, payments on Subordinated
Shareholder Funding held by, and loans or other advances made to, any Parent to

to the Agreed Security Principles, Guaranteed by the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and (y) any net proceeds from such initial
Indebtedness are, directly or indirectly, contributed to the equity of the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form or otherwise lent to or received by
the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form; provided that (i)
any net proceeds described in sub-clause (y) above shall be excluded for purposes
of increasing the amount available for distribution pursuant to clause (b)(ii) below

(2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the
Senior Notes Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent of the Senior Notes Issuer held by

Designated Bank Accounts, Substitute Retail Assets, Post-Completion Disposal
Receivables or Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock));

(3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or
otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or
scheduled sinking fund payment, any Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such

in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal instalment or final maturity,
in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase,
redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement, and (b) any Indebtedness

"—Limitation on Indebtedness");

value, any Subordinated Shareholder Funding, except as permitted by clause (1)(c) above;
or

(5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person,

acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) are referred to herein
as a "Restricted Payment"), if:

immediately thereafter therefrom); or

(ii) the Senior Notes Issuer is not able to Incur an additional £1.00 of
Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under "—

Restricted Payment; or

(b) at the time the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes any such
Restricted Payment, the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other
Restricted Payments made subsequent to the Issue Date (and not returned or rescinded)
(including Permitted Payments permitted below by clauses (5), (10) and (17) of the second
paragraph of this covenant, but excluding all other Restricted Payments permitted by the
second paragraph) would exceed the sum of (without duplication):

period) from the first day of the fiscal quarter commencing prior to the Issue Date to

consolidated into the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, 100% of the
amount received in cash and the fair market value (as determined in accordance

proceeds of which will be used to fund the payment of dividends to holders of any class or
series of Designated Preference Shares of such Parent or Affiliate issued after the Issue
Date; provided that the amount of all dividends declared or paid pursuant to this clause
(15) shall not exceed the Net Cash Proceeds received by the Senior Notes Issuer or the
aggregate amount contributed in cash to the equity (other than through the issuance of
Disqualified Stock, an Excluded Contribution, a Parent Debt Contribution, the Equity
Contribution or a Retail Assets Contribution or, in the case of Designated Preference
Shares issued by any Parent or an Affiliate thereof, the issuance of Designated Preference
Shares) of the Senior Notes Issuer, or lent as Subordinated Shareholder Funding to the
Senior Notes Issuer, as applicable, from the issuance or sale of such Designated
Preference Shares;

(16) dividends or other distributions of (i) Capital Stock, Indebtedness or other
securities of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, and, (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, Warehouse
Assets, Select Retail Assets, balances credited to the Designated Bank Accounts,
Substitute Retail Assets and Post-Completion Disposal Receivables;

(17) so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (or would result
therefrom), any Restricted Payment; provided that the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio
would not exceed 2.6 to 1.0 on a pro forma basis, after giving effect to any such Restricted
Payment;

(18) Restricted Payments to purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise
acquire or retire Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness of a direct or indirect Parent
of the Senior Notes Issuer in an aggregate amount outstanding at any time not to exceed
the greater of 20% of Consolidated EBITDA and £240 million; and

(19) Restricted Payments made to fund, directly or indirectly, any payments
required pursuant to the terms of the Acquisition Agreement.

The amount of all Restricted Payments (other than cash) shall be the fair market value on the date of
such Restricted Payment of the assets or securities proposed to be distributed, paid as a dividend in kind,
transferred or issued by the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be,
pursuant to such Restricted Payment, as conclusively determined by the Board of Directors of the Senior
Notes Issuer acting in good faith. The fair market value of any cash Restricted Payment shall be its face
amount.

For purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, in the event that a Restricted Payment (or
portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Payments described in
clauses (1) through (19) of the second paragraph of this covenant, or is permitted pursuant to the first
paragraph of this covenant and/or one or more of the clauses contained in the definition of "Permitted
Investment," the Senior Notes Issuer will be entitled to classify such Restricted Payment or Investment (or
portion thereof) on the date of its payment or later reclassify (based on circumstances existing on the date
of such reclassification) such Restricted Payment or Investment (or portion thereof) in any manner that
complies with this covenant, including as an Investment pursuant to one of more clauses contained in the
definition of "Permitted Investment."

Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this covenant or in the definition of "Permitted Investments,"
neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary shall distribute or transfer, directly or
indirectly, any material intellectual property rights owned or licensed in as of the Issue Date or, in the case

420


-----

of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Completion Date to any Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer (other
than a Restricted Subsidiary) by way of a Restricted Payment or a Permitted Investment (including
transferring such material intellectual property rights to a Restricted Subsidiary in contemplation of
designating it as an Unrestricted Subsidiary).

If the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary makes a Restricted Payment to, or a Permitted
Investment into, any Parent (including by way of prepayment, purchase or redemption of any Proceeds
Loan prior to scheduled maturity) to fund the repayment, prepayment, purchase or redemption of any
Subordinated Indebtedness by such Parent, there shall be no double-counting of the two transactions for
the purposes of this covenant and only the former, not the latter, shall be deemed a Restricted Payment
or a Permitted Investment made by the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary under the Senior
Notes Indenture.

_Limitation on Liens_

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, Incur or suffer to exist any Lien upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock of a
Restricted Subsidiary), other than Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets, Designated Bank Accounts,
Substitute Retail Assets and Post-Completion Disposal Receivables, whether owned on the Issue Date
or acquired after that date, or any interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing
any Indebtedness (such Lien, the "Initial Lien"), except:

(a) in the case of any property or asset that does not constitute Collateral,

(1) Permitted Liens, or

(2) Liens on property or assets that are not Permitted Liens, if the
Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture (or a Notes Guarantee in the
case of Liens over property or assets of a Guarantor) are, subject to the
Agreed Security Principles, directly secured equally and ratably with or prior
to, in the case of Liens with respect to Pari Passu Indebtedness, or prior to,
in the case of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the
Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien, for so long as such Indebtedness
is so secured. Any Lien so created to secure the Senior Notes, the Senior
Notes Indenture or a Notes Guarantee will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of
the Initial Lien to which it relates; and

(b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral
Liens.

Any Lien securing the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture or the Notes Guarantees will be
automatically and unconditionally released and discharged as set forth under "—Security—Release of
_Liens."_

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Liens shall be required to secure the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes
Indenture or the Notes Guarantees over property, assets or Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary that
is a member of the Regulated Group or over any intercompany receivables owed by or to members of the
Regulated Group; upon any Restricted Subsidiary becoming a member of the Regulated Group, Security
Interests over such property, assets, Capital Stock or intercompany receivables shall be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged.

_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise
cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital
Stock or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured
by, its profits;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary,

421


-----

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock, and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to or arising from (a) any Credit
Facility (including the Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, the
Senior Bridge Facility and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility), (b) the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (c) the Senior Secured Notes
Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture, (d) the Acquisition Agreement, (e) the Forecourt
SPA, (f) the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Account Charges, (g) any other
agreement or instrument of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of
the Issue Date that is in effect on or was entered into on the Issue Date or in connection
with the Financing Transactions, (h) any other agreement or instrument of the Company
and its Subsidiaries that is in effect on the Completion Date, (i) any other agreement or
instrument that is necessary or advisable (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or a member of Senior Management) to consummate the Transactions, or (j) any
Forecourt Assets Separation;

(2) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument of a
Person, or relating to any Capital Stock or Indebtedness of a Person, entered into on or
before the date on which such Person was acquired by or merged, consolidated or
otherwise combined with or into the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or
on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock
or Indebtedness Incurred as consideration for, or to provide all or any portion of the funds
utilised to consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which
such Person became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Senior Notes Issuer
or was merged, consolidated or otherwise combined with or into the Senior Notes Issuer
or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in connection with such transaction) and
outstanding on such date; provided that, if another Person is the Successor Company (as
defined under "—Merger and Consolidation"), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or
instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed
by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the
Successor Company;

(3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument
effecting a refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances,
an agreement or instrument referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause
(3) (an "Initial Agreement") or contained in any amendment, supplement or other
modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause
(3); _provided,_ _however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such_
Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less
favourable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances
and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such
refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management);

(4) (a) any encumbrance or restriction:

(i) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or
transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, licence or similar
contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, licence or other contract;

(ii) contained in mortgages, charges, pledges or other security
agreements permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture or securing
Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted
under the Senior Notes Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or
restrictions restrict the transfer of the property or assets subject to such
mortgages, charges, pledges or other security agreements; or

422


-----

(iii) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real
property interests set forth in any reciprocal easement agreements of the
Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(b) any encumbrance, restriction, inhibition, covenant, restrictive covenant,
grant of rights, stipulation, agreement, interest, overriding interest, wayleave, option,
right of pre-emption, right of first refusal or charge registered or existing, in each
case, in respect of any real property interests of the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary as at either the Issue Date or, in the case of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, the Completion Date or not otherwise prohibited by the Senior
Notes Indenture or in respect of any Warehouse Asset, Select Retail Asset or
Substitute Retail Asset;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations,
Capitalised Lease Obligations, operating lease agreements or Sale and Leaseback
Transactions permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture, in each case, that impose
encumbrances or restrictions on the property so acquired or leased, or any encumbrance
or restriction pursuant to a joint venture agreement that imposes restrictions on the
distribution or transfer of the assets or Capital Stock of the joint venture;

(6) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary (or any
of its property or assets) imposed pursuant to an agreement entered into for the direct or
indirect sale or disposition to a Person of all or substantially all the Capital Stock or assets
of such Restricted Subsidiary (or the property or assets that are subject to such restriction),
pending the closing of such sale or disposition;

(7) customary provisions in leases, licences, joint venture agreements and other
similar agreements and instruments entered into in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice;

(8) encumbrances or restrictions arising or existing by reason of applicable law or
any applicable rule, regulation or order, or required by any regulatory authority;

by customers under agreements entered into in the ordinary course of business or
consistent with past practice;

Rate Agreements or Commodity Hedging Agreements;

(11) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument
relating to any Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Issue Date
pursuant to the provisions of the covenant described under "—Limitation on
_Indebtedness," if:_

(i) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or
instrument, taken as a whole, are not materially less favourable to the Holders of
the Senior Notes than (a) the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Senior
Facilities Agreement, together with the security documents associated therewith,
and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the Completion Date,
(b) is customary in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Board
of Directors or a member of Senior Management), or

(ii) where the Senior Notes Issuer determines that such encumbrance or
restriction will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Senior Notes Issuer's
ability to make principal or interest payments on the Senior Notes;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with factoring, securitisations, receivables
financings or similar arrangements, including (without limitation) by a Securitisation
Subsidiary in a Qualified Securitisation Financing, that, in the good faith determination of

effect such factoring, securitisations, receivables financings or similar arrangements;

(13) any encumbrance or restriction existing by reason of any lien permitted under
"—Limitation on Liens";

course of business or consistent with past practice;

(16) customary restrictions included in shareholder agreements, including, without
limitation, those relating to non-Wholly Owned Subsidiaries; and

_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any
Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the consideration the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives
for such Asset Disposition is not less than the fair market value of the assets disposed of as
of the date of entry into binding documentation in respect of such Asset Disposition (as
determined by the Senior Notes Issuer's Board of Directors); and

(2) at least 75% of the consideration the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted
Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Disposition consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion
within 180 days of such Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations
received in consideration of such Asset Disposition);

(ii) Cash Equivalents;

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the
Senior Notes Issuer's or such Restricted Subsidiary's balance sheet or the notes
thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the latest balance sheet, that would be
recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated Indebtedness), as a
result of which neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
remains obligated in respect of such liabilities, or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted
Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Disposition, if the Senior Notes Issuer and every other Restricted Subsidiary is
released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset
Disposition;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Capital Stock or assets of the kind referred to in clause (D) or (F) in
the second paragraph of this covenant;

(vi) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Guarantor received from Persons who are not the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, but only to the extent that such Indebtedness (i) has been
extinguished by the Senior Notes Issuer or the applicable Guarantor, and (ii) is not
Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or such Guarantor;

(vii) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary having an aggregate fair market value, taken
together with all other Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to
this covenant that is at any one time outstanding, not to exceed the greater of 20%
of Consolidated EBITDA and £120.0 million (with the fair market value of each issue
of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and
without giving effect to subsequent changes in value); or

(viii) any combination of the types of consideration specified in clauses (i)
through (vii) of this clause (2).

If the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, within 390
days (or such period as provided in clause (H) below, if applicable) of the later of the date of consummation
of such Asset Disposition and receipt of such Net Available Cash, the Senior Notes Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary may use the Net Available Cash to:

(A) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases,
voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Senior
Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

424


-----

(ii) unless included in (A)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open
market purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market
prices) Senior Notes or any other Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that the Senior Notes
Issuer shall be entitled to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem such other Pari Passu
Indebtedness that constitutes Public Debt pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Senior Notes
Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to
purchase Senior Notes, in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset
Disposition Offer, in such an amount as would reduce the aggregate principal amount of
Senior Notes then outstanding in the same proportion as the aggregate principal amount of
such other Pari Passu Indebtedness would be reduced by such prepayments, repayments,
purchases or redemptions; or

(iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases,
voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is
secured on assets that do not constitute Collateral (in each case, other than Subordinated
Indebtedness of a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary);

(B) purchase any series of Senior Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such
series of Senior Notes, redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender
offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any series of Senior Notes
pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture or by making an Asset
Disposition Offer to all Holders of the Senior Notes (in accordance with the procedures set
out below);

(C) invest in any Replacement Assets;

(D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another
Person engaged in a Similar Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital
Stock, such Person is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary;

(E) make a capital expenditure;

(F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that
are used or useful in a Similar Business;

(G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or

(H) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause
(A), (C), (D), (E) or (F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, provided that, a binding
commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the
date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is
consummated, and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 390-day
period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date.

The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth above constitutes "Excess Proceeds."
Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Senior Notes Issuer may temporarily
reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not
prohibited by the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture.

On the 391st day (or the 571[st ]day if a binding commitment as described in clause (H) is entered into)
after an Asset Disposition, or such earlier time as the Senior Notes Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount
of Excess Proceeds exceeds £50.0 million, the Senior Notes Issuer will be required within 10 Business
Days thereof to make an offer ("Asset Disposition Offer") to all Holders and, to the extent the Senior
Notes Issuer elects, to all or some holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the
maximum principal amount of Senior Notes and any Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out
of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price, in respect of the Senior Notes, equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, and, in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, of no more than 100% of the principal
amount thereof, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of
purchase. The Asset Disposition Offer in respect of Senior Notes will be made in accordance with the
procedures set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture, in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral
multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered
and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the
Senior Notes Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (the "Retained Declined Proceeds") for

425


-----

any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture. If the aggregate amount of Senior
Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset
Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among
the tendering holders of Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness pro rata based on the aggregate
principal amount of Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so tendered and not properly
withdrawn. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness tendered in an
Asset Disposition Offer that is not denominated in sterling, such principal amount shall be converted into
its Sterling Equivalent as of a date selected by the Senior Notes Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition
Offer Period or no more than five Business Days prior to the beginning of the Asset Disposition Offer
Period. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at
zero.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Notes is
denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Notes are denominated,
the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in
the currency in which such Senior Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Senior Notes
Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Notes, will remain open for a period of
not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the "Asset Disposition Offer Period"). No
later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the "Asset
**Disposition Purchase Date"), the Senior Notes Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior Notes**
and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to
such offer (the "Asset Disposition Offer Amount") or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount
has been so validly tendered, all Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response
to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful,
accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of
Senior Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Notes and other Pari Passu
Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if
less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all
Senior Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and
in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

The Senior Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Senior Notes
or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Senior Notes Issuer in accordance with the terms of
this covenant. The Senior Notes Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any
case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or
deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Notes so validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Senior Notes Issuer for
purchase. Any Senior Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred or returned
in accordance with applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream) by the Senior Notes Issuer to the
Holder thereof.

The Senior Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of
the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior
Notes pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or
regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior
Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not
consummate Sale and Leaseback Transactions with any Person (other than the Senior Notes Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary) that, when taken together with all Sale and Leaseback Transactions
consummated since the Issue Date, would yield, in aggregate, gross proceeds of more than the lesser of
(x) £1,200 million and (y) £1,400 million minus the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to clause (12)(b) of the definition of "Permitted Debt" and outstanding at the time of determination.

The provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer's obligation to make
an Asset Disposition Offer may be waived or modified with the consent of Holders of a majority in
outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes (with such consent, for the avoidance of doubt, to be
considered effective if the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes of consenting Holders
represents a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes as a whole and
without regard to the level of consent obtained among Holders of each constituent series of Senior Notes).

_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_

The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to enter into or
conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange
of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer (any such
transaction or series of related transactions being an "Affiliate Transaction") involving aggregate value in
excess of the greater of 10% of Consolidated EBITDA and £120 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction, taken as a whole, are not materially less
favourable to the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be,
than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction with a Person who is not an
Affiliate at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for
such transaction in arm's-length dealings; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the
greater of 20% of Consolidated EBITDA and £240 million, the terms of such transaction or
series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors
of the Senior Notes Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described
under "—Limitation on Restricted Payments," any Permitted Payments (other than
pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
"—Limitations on Restricted Payments") or any Permitted Investment (other than
Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other
securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant
to the terms of, the funding of, entering into or maintenance of (i) any employment,
consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement and
any related trust or other similar agreement, (ii) any other compensation arrangements,
options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer, any
Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, (iii) restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans,
stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or
consultants' plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation,
severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or (iv)
indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved
by the Board of Directors of the Senior Notes Issuer, in each case, in the ordinary course
of business or consistent with past practice;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Senior Notes Issuer and any Restricted
Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction),
or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any Securitisation Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary
indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and
pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of
the Senior Notes Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent (whether directly or
indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors,
officers or employees);

(6) (i) the Transactions, excluding the ASDA Leases, and (ii) the ASDA Leases, to the
extent entered into or replaced or amended from time to time on terms substantially
consistent with those described in this Offering Memorandum;

(iii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer or any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the Issue Date under the terms of any transaction
pursuant to or contemplated by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding,
any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements
and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced
or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to
the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect;

(iv) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated

427


-----

by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument
in effect as of or on the Completion Date, as these agreements and instruments may be
amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time
to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more
disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect; and

(v) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing
agreement;

(7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any

fair to the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice
between or among the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate

reasonably be obtained in a comparable framework agreement in arm's-length dealings
with an unaffiliated party at the time of entry into binding documentation.

_Reports_

So long as any Senior Notes are outstanding, the Senior Notes Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the
following reports:

(1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, 150
days) after the end of the Senior Notes Issuer's fiscal year, annual reports containing, to the
extent applicable: (i) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements,

statement and balance sheet information of the Senior Notes Issuer, together with
explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred since

in a previous report provided pursuant to clauses (2), (3) or (4) below); provided that such
_pro forma_ financial information will be provided only to the extent available without
unreasonable expense, in which case the Senior Notes Issuer will provide, in the case of a
material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) the audited consolidated balance
sheet of the Senior Notes Issuer as at the end of the most recent fiscal year and audited

-----

condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited
condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter or year-to-date
period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date and the comparable prior
period, together with condensed footnote disclosure (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will

IFRS); (ii) unaudited _pro forma_ income statement and balance sheet information of the
Senior Notes Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions,
dispositions or recapitalisations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently

and provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent
available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Senior Notes Issuer will provide,
in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials); (iii) a concise operating
and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the
consolidated financial condition, results of operations and material changes in liquidity and
capital resources of the Senior Notes Issuer; (iv) a discussion of material changes in material
debt instruments since the most recent report; and (v) material subsequent events and any
material changes to the risk factors disclosed in the most recent annual report; provided that
the information described in clauses (iv) and (v) may be provided in the footnotes to the
unaudited financial statements; and

(4) promptly after the occurrence of a material event that the Senior Notes Issuer
announces publicly or any acquisition, disposition or restructuring, merger or similar
transaction that is material to the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (other
than the Acquisition), taken as a whole, or a senior executive officer or director changes at
the Senior Notes Issuer or a change in auditors of the Senior Notes Issuer, a report
containing a description of such event; provided that, if the Senior Notes Issuer intends to
make a public announcement of the appointment of a new senior executive officer other
than by means of a report pursuant to this clause (4), the Senior Notes Issuer may delay
furnishing such report to the Trustee until the day on which the Senior Notes Issuer
otherwise makes such public announcement.

In addition, the Senior Notes Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the
request of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the
Securities Act for so long as the Senior Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by
persons who are not "affiliates" under the Securities Act.

The Senior Notes Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Senior
Notes copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Senior Notes Issuer's website.

All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS and on a consistent basis
for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however,
that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present
earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as specified in the second succeeding
paragraph, no report need include separate financial statements for the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical
disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will
not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer may satisfy its obligations under the preceding
paragraphs of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual and quarterly reports or
other information of the Company or any Parent of the Company, for so long as the Company or such
Parent is either a Subsidiary or a Parent of the Senior Notes Issuer. To the extent that material differences
exist between the management, business, assets, shareholding or results of operations or financial
condition of such other reporting entity and the Senior Notes Issuer, the annual and quarterly reports shall
include a concise description and an unaudited reconciliation of such material differences. Upon complying
with the foregoing requirement, the Senior Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the
provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs.

At any time that any of the Senior Notes Issuer's subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any
such Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information
required by the first paragraph of this "Reports" covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation,
either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and
results of operations of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial
condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer.

430


-----

All reports provided pursuant to this "Reports" covenant shall be made in the English language. In the
event that (i) the Senior Notes Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or
15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the
reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer elects to provide to the
Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Senior Notes
Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision
of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for
so long as it elects, the Senior Notes Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Senior Notes Issuer is, or would be, required to file with
the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the
Senior Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding
paragraphs.

Following an initial public offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity or the listing of such Capital
Stock on a recognised stock exchange, the reporting obligations of the reporting entity pursuant to the
preceding paragraphs of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies
with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange (other than with respect to delivery of a compliance
certificate).

_Merger and Consolidation_

The Senior Notes Issuer

The Senior Notes Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer,
lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Company") will be a
Person organised and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union,
the United Kingdom, Jersey, the United States of America, any State of the United States
or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and
the Successor Company (if not the Senior Notes Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by
supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior
Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer
under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (if any) and
the Security Documents, as applicable;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness
that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor
Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor
Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor
Company would be able to Incur at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to
the first paragraph of the covenant described under "—Limitation on Indebtedness" or (b)
the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving
effect to such transaction; and

(4) the Senior Notes Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that execution and delivery of the binding
documentation providing for such consolidation, merger or transfer and of such
supplemental indenture (if any) do not result in a breach of the Senior Notes Indenture and
an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been
duly authorised, executed and delivered and is a valid and binding agreement, enforceable
against the Successor Company in accordance with its terms (in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), _provided that in giving an Opinion of_
Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
(or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a
result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing
Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant
described under "—Limitation on Indebtedness."

431


-----

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition
of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer
to any person other than the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which properties and assets,
if held by the Senior Notes Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of the Senior Notes Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the
transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Notes Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or
substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the
Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase "substantially all" under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular
transaction would involve "substantially all" of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this "Merger
_and Consolidation" covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition_
if the Senior Notes Issuer has complied with the covenant described under "—Limitation on Sales of Assets
_and Subsidiary Stock" or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary._

The Guarantors

No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms
of the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement)
may:

(1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor
is the surviving corporation);

(2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all
of the assets of such Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one
transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or

(3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless:

(A) the other Person is the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
that is a Guarantor or, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, becomes a
Guarantor (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee);

(B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting,
surviving or, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the transferee Person
expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Notes
Guarantee and the Senior Notes Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture
executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); and (2)
immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default
shall have occurred and is continuing; or

(C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of
consolidation or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or
substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each case other than to the Senior
Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Notes
Indenture,

_provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this heading "—The Guarantors"_
shall not apply to the extent that compliance with clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B)(1) could give rise to or result
in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent
preference, thin capitalisation rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws
rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the
officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of
such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or
shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including
with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

432


-----

_General_

The provisions set forth in this "Merger and Consolidation" covenant shall not restrict (and shall not
apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Senior Notes Issuer,
a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or
liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Senior Notes Issuer or another
Guarantor; (iii) a Guarantor transferring all or part of its properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary
that is not a Guarantor in order to comply with any law, rule, regulation or order, recommendation or
directions of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Senior Notes Issuer
or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (iv) any consolidation or merger of the Senior Notes Issuer into any
Guarantor; _provided_ that, if the Senior Notes Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or
consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the
Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading "—Senior Notes Issuer"
shall apply to such transaction; (v) a Permitted Reorganisation or the solvent liquidation of any Restricted
Subsidiary; (vi) the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with
an Affiliate incorporated or organised for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity,
reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; _provided,_
_however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading "—The Senior Notes Issuer" or clauses (3)(A) and_
(3)(B) under the heading "—The Guarantors," as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction; and
(vii) any corporate reorganisations or other steps necessary or advisable to consummate or facilitate the
Transactions.

_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and
no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a "Suspension Event"), then, beginning on
that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Notes cease to have Investment Grade
Status (the "Reversion Date"), the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture summarised under the
following captions will not apply to the Senior Notes:

(1) "—Limitation on Restricted Payments";

(2) "—Limitation on Indebtedness";

(3) "—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries";

(4) "—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions";

(5) "—Additional Notes Guarantees";

(6) "—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock"; and

(7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under
"—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer"

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Notes Indenture will cease to be effective
and will not be applicable to the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the
first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any
effect with regard to actions of the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken
during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will
constitute a Default or Event of Default. The "Limitation on Restricted Payments" covenant will be
interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Notes Indenture but not during the
continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the
continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that
it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
_"—Limitation on Indebtedness," as applicable. In addition, the Senior Notes Indenture will also permit,_
without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries
to honour any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Senior
Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered
into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Notes no longer having an
Investment Grade Status. The Senior Notes Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in
the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, _provided_ that, no such notification shall be a
condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective.

433


-----

There can be no assurance that the Senior Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade
Status.

_Impairment of Security Interest_

Holdco and the Senior Notes Issuer shall not, and in each case, shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of
materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that neither the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, nor any Forecourt Assets Separation, nor any repayment of
intercompany receivables from time to time (including the Forecourt Disposal Receivable), nor any
distribution or disposal of Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets, Substitute Retail Assets, Designated
Bank Accounts or Post-Completion Disposal Receivables shall under any circumstances be deemed to
materially impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the
Holders, and Holdco and the Senior Notes Issuer shall not, and in each case, shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee
and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral,
except that:

(i) Holdco, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur
Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged and released and retaken
in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent
applicable in each case;

(ii) the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced, from time to time to: (1) cure any
ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (2) further secure the Senior
Notes (including Additional Senior Notes), (3) make provision for equal and ratable pledges
of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Notes, (4) implement any Permitted Collateral
Liens, (5) amend the Security Documents in accordance with the terms thereof, or (6)
make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders
in any material respect;

(iii) any Permitted Reorganisation may be implemented in accordance with the
provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture;

(iv) any corporate reorganisations or other steps necessary or advisable to
consummate or facilitate the Transactions may be implemented; or

(v) the Security Documents may otherwise be amended, extended, renewed, restated,
supplemented, released and retaken, or replaced where, contemporaneously with any
such action, the Senior Notes Issuer delivers to the Trustee:

(1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the
Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Holdco and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as applicable, after giving effect to any transactions
related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release
or replacement,

(2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person confirming
the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to
any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, release or replacement, or

(3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such
amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification
or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are
valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening
period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to
immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement,
supplement, modification or replacement.

434


-----

In the event that Holdco, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (as applicable)
comply with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to
customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions
from the Holders.

_Additional Notes Guarantees_

No Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor shall Guarantee (i) any Indebtedness of the Senior
Notes Issuer or any Guarantor under any Syndicated Term Facilities, (ii) any Indebtedness of the Senior
Notes Issuer or any Guarantor under any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending
commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination, or (iii) any Public Debt, unless
such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor by no later than 10 Business Days after the date on
which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture in the form attached to the Senior Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary
will provide a Notes Guarantee; provided that:

(a) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to provide a Notes Guarantee
pursuant to this covenant as a result of Incurring a Guarantee under clause (2)(b) of the
definition of "Permitted Debt";

(b) no Restricted Subsidiary that is a member of the Regulated Group shall be
required to provide a Notes Guarantee pursuant to this covenant; and

(c) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be obligated to become a Guarantor pursuant to
this covenant to the extent that, and for so long as, the Incurrence of such Notes
Guarantee would be inconsistent with the Agreed Security Principles or may reasonably
be expected to give rise to or result in (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations,
corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation rules,
capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or
regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability
for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (3) any cost,
expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) which cannot be
avoided through measures reasonably available to the Senior Notes Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any
governmental or regulatory filings undertaken in connection with such Notes Guarantee.

At the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on such
Guarantor's liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognise certain defences generally available
to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference,
financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences
affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law.

Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under "—
_Notes Guarantees." A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the_
Senior Notes Issuer if, at the date of such release, there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding
which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the
Senior Notes Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The Trustee and the
Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under
the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes
Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent
being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction.

The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of
each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in "Risk Factors" and "Certain
_Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the_
_Security Interests."_

_Financial Calculations_

When determining whether any transaction is permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior
Notes Issuer shall be permitted to test it, at its option, (i) on the date binding documentation for such
transaction is entered into, (ii) on the date that any notice of any repayment, redemption, repurchase or
refinancing of any Indebtedness is given to the holders thereof (if applicable), (iii) to the extent the nature
or circumstances of a transaction make (i) or (ii) inapplicable, on the date that notice of such transaction is
provided to the Holders in accordance with the provisions described in "—Notices" below or (iv) the date
such transaction is consummated. If the Senior Notes Issuer elects to test the transaction as described in
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the determination as to whether the transaction is permitted under the Senior

435


-----

Notes Indenture shall be made assuming that the transaction and other transactions to be entered into in
connection therewith were consummated on the date binding documentation was entered into or such
notice was given to the Trustee or the Holders (each, an "Alternative Testing Date"), as applicable. If the
transaction was permitted on the Alternative Testing Date chosen by the Senior Notes Issuer, it shall
continue to be deemed so permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture even if it would have otherwise
resulted in a Default or an Event of Default on the date it is consummated. When determining whether any
transaction is permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture as of the Alternative Testing Date, the Senior
Notes Issuer will make all necessary calculations as set forth under the definition of "Consolidated Net
_Leverage Ratio."_

If the Senior Notes Issuer has elected to test a transaction on an Alternative Testing Date (an
"Alternative Testing Date Election"), the transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on such date for
the purposes of making any other determination under the Senior Notes Indenture, until such time (the
"Election Termination Time") as (a) the transaction is definitively terminated, cancelled or abandoned,
(b) the Senior Notes Issuer has revoked its Alternative Testing Date Election and has instead opted to test
the transaction on the date it is consummated, which the Senior Notes Issuer will be entitled to do,
irrevocably and only once, at any time until the transaction is consummated, or (c) the transaction is
consummated. From the time the Senior Notes Issuer makes an Alternative Testing Date Election to the
related Election Termination Time, the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture will apply assuming that
the relevant transaction was consummated on the Alternative Testing Date. No action properly taken by
the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries between an Alternative Testing Date Election
and the related Election Termination Time will constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Senior
Notes Indenture. In addition, the Senior Notes Indenture will permit, without causing a Default or Event of
Default, the Senior Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honour any contractual
commitments undertaken during such period of time, so long as they were not undertaken in anticipation
of the Election Termination Time.

_Topco Covenant_

Within 10 Business Days (or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter to the extent that consent or
requirements of third parties are required to be obtained or satisfied) after all amounts due and payable
under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility have been repaid in full or the Distribution Asset
Disposal Bridge Facility has otherwise been irrevocably satisfied and discharged, the Senior Notes Issuer
shall procure that Topco and its controlled Affiliates contribute to the equity of the Senior Notes Issuer,
lend to the Senior Notes Issuer as Subordinated Shareholder Funding or apply toward repayment of PostCompletion Disposal Receivables held by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries: (i)
any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets owned by Topco or any such controlled Affiliates of
Topco at such time, and (ii) an amount equal to any Net Available Cash received by Topco or any such
controlled Affiliates of Topco from sale and leaseback transactions or other disposals in respect of such
assets (including any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds) that have not been applied toward repayment or
prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility (each such contribution, loan or repayment
a "Retail Assets Contribution"). For the avoidance of doubt, any failure by Topco or any of Topco's
controlled Affiliates to make any required Retail Assets Contributions shall constitute a default of the Senior
Notes Issuer's obligation to procure such contributions.

Neither Topco nor any of Topco's controlled Affiliates, other than Holdco, the Senior Notes Issuer and
the Guarantors, will become parties to, or otherwise be bound by, the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture.
In addition, neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries have the direct power to
control the management or policies of Topco or any of its controlled Affiliates (other than the Senior Notes
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries). See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Acquisition—The Issuers
_do not control Topco and cannot directly cause Topco to effect the Retail Assets Contribution."_

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an "Event of Default" under the Senior Notes Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Senior Note issued under the Senior Notes
Indenture when due and payable, continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Senior
Note issued under the Senior Notes Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon
optional redemption, upon required repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise;

(3) failure by Holdco, the Senior Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to
comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Notes with its other agreements contained in the Senior
Notes Indenture;

436


-----

(4) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be
issued or by which there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money
borrowed by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment
of which is Guaranteed by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries)
other than Indebtedness owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date,
which default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal at stated maturity on such
Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in
such Indebtedness ("payment default"); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the
"cross acceleration provision"),

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the
principal amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment
default or the maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates £60 million or more;

(5) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of Holdco, the Senior
Notes Issuer or a Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Senior Notes
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary (the
"bankruptcy provisions");

(6) failure by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of
Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial
statements for the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of £60 million
(exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has acknowledged liability
for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of 60 days after the
judgment becomes final (the "judgment default provision");

(7) (a) any security interest under the Security Documents shall, at any time, cease to
be in full force and effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security
Document, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the
Senior Notes Indenture, and except through the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of
the Trustee or Security Agent) with respect to Collateral having a fair market value in
excess of £60.0 million, for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations
under the Senior Notes Indenture or the release of any such security interest in accordance
with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, or (b) any such security interest
created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent
jurisdiction or the Senior Notes Issuer shall assert in writing that any such security interest
is invalid or unenforceable, and in each case under clauses (a) and (b), any such Default
continues for 10 days (the "security default **provision"); and**

(8) any Notes Guarantee of a Significant Subsidiary ceases to be in full force and effect
(other than in accordance with the terms of such Notes Guarantee or the Senior Notes
Indenture) or is declared invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or
any Guarantor denies or disaffirms in writing its obligations under its Notes Guarantee and,
in each case, any such Default continues for 10 days (the "guarantees provision").

A Default under clauses (4) or (6) of the preceding paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default
unless the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the
Senior Notes Indenture notify the Senior Notes Issuer of the Default and the Senior Notes Issuer fails to
cure such Default within the time specified in clauses (4) or (6), as applicable, of the preceding paragraph,
after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Senior Notes Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal
amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture, by written notice to the Senior
Notes Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the
principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Notes under the Senior
Notes Indenture, to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued
and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. For the avoidance of doubt, the bankruptcy

437


-----

provisions will exclude the enforcement of Liens described in clause (31) of the definition of "Permitted
_Liens," including by way of appointment of a receiver for such purpose._

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes because an Event of Default described
in clause (4) under "Events of Default" has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of
the Senior Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such
Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) has been remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the
Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of
Default has been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto
and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Notes would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all other Events of Default outstanding, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Notes that became due solely because of the
acceleration of the Senior Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium,
if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Notes will become and be immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

Holders of the Senior Notes may not enforce the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes except as
provided in the Senior Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided
in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the Senior Notes
Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment
of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect
to such Senior Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of
a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event
of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or
powers under the Senior Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such
Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss,
liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no
Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is
continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have
requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it
against any loss, liability or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of
the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have
not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with
such request within such 60-day period.

Other than in cases where the Senior Notes Indenture permits the Trustee or the Security Agent to act
without instructions from Holders or with instructions given by Holders of a lower percentage of principal
amount of Senior Notes outstanding, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior
Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture will be entitled to (i) direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or
power conferred on the Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture, (ii) give instructions to the Security
Agent for the purpose of taking, ceasing or refraining from taking any enforcement action under the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, (iii) give
instructions to the Security Agent for the purpose of granting or withholding any such consent or exercising
any such remedy or power as may be required or contemplated under the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, or (iv) give instructions to
the Trustee for the purposes of giving or withholding any such consent, taking, ceasing or refraining from
taking any such action or exercising any such remedy or power as may be contemplated under the terms
of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be

438


-----

required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the
conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law
or the Senior Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other
Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior
Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it against all
losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Notes Indenture will
provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the
Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being
notified by the Senior Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the
Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Senior Notes Issuer is
required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within
120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof
know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Senior Notes Issuer is
required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within
30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute
certain Defaults, their status and what action the Senior Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in
respect thereof.

The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required
certificate in connection with another default (an "Initial Default") then at the time such Initial Default is
cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default
will also be cured without any further action, and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply
with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled "—Certain Covenants—Reports" or otherwise to
deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture shall be
deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate,
as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Notes
Indenture.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Notes Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise
modified with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange
offer for, Senior Notes) and, subject to certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions
thereof may be waived with the consent of the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the
Senior Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender
offer or exchange offer for, Senior Notes); provided that, if any amendment, supplement, other modification
or waiver will only amend, supplement or waive a default or provision affecting only one series of the Senior
Notes, only the consent of Holders representing a majority in aggregate principal amount of the thenoutstanding Senior Notes of such series shall be required.

However, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount
of the Senior Notes affected, then outstanding, an amendment or waiver of the Senior Notes Indenture or
the Senior Notes may not, with respect to any Senior Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Senior Notes whose Holders must consent to an
amendment, waiver or modification;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any
Senior Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Senior Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Senior Note or change
the time at which any Senior Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above
under "—Optional Redemption";

(5) make any Senior Note payable in money other than that stated in the Senior Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest or
Additional Amounts, if any, on such Holder's Senior Notes on or after the due dates
therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or with respect to
such Holder's Senior Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Senior Notes Indenture described under
"Withholding Taxes" that adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Senior Notes in

439


-----

any material respect or amends the terms of such Senior Notes in a way that would result
in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes described thereunder or an exemption
from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so described thereunder unless the Senior
Notes Issuer or the applicable Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(8) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the non-payment of principal,
premium or interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on the Senior Notes (except pursuant
to a rescission of acceleration of the Senior Notes by the Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of such Senior Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration); or

(9) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders'
consent described in this sentence,

_provided, however, that if such amendment or waiver described above only affects or would only affect_
Holders of one or more series of Senior Notes (but not all series of Senior Notes), only the consent of
Holders of not less than 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Notes of
the series so affected shall be required.

Without the consent of Holders holding not less than 80% of the aggregate principal amount of the
Senior Notes affected, then outstanding, an amendment or waiver of the Senior Notes Indenture or the
Security Documents may not, with respect to any Senior Notes held by a non-consenting Holder, (a)
release all or substantially all of the security interests granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral
other than in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any applicable Additional
Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes Indenture or the applicable Security Documents, or (b) permit
all or substantially all of the relevant Guarantors to be released from their obligations under the Notes
Guarantees or the Senior Notes Indenture, except in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes
Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any applicable Additional Intercreditor Agreement; _provided_
that, if any such amendment or waiver will only amend, supplement or waive a default or provision affecting
only one series of the Senior Notes, only the consent of Holders representing 80% in aggregate principal
amount of the then-outstanding Senior Notes of such series shall be required.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee,
the Security Agent and the other parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Notes
Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Senior
Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary under any Notes Document;

(3) add to the covenants or provide for a Notes Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders
or surrender any right or power conferred upon the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary;

(4) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or
the Holders or that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of
the Holders in any material respect under the Notes Documents;

(5) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors or a member of Senior Management) for the issuance of Additional Senior Notes;

(6) to provide for any Restricted Subsidiary to provide a Notes Guarantee in
accordance with the covenant described under "—Certain Covenants—Limitation on
_Indebtedness" or "—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees," to add_
Guarantees with respect to the Senior Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the
Senior Notes, or to confirm and evidence the release, termination, discharge or retaking
of any Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and the Security Documents) or any
amendment in respect thereof with respect to or securing the Senior Notes when such
release, termination, discharge or retaking or amendment is provided for under the Senior
Notes Indenture, the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(7) to conform the text of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Documents or the Senior Notes to any provision of this "Description of the Senior
_Notes" to the extent that such provision in this "Description of the Senior_ _Notes" was_

440


-----

intended to be a verbatim recitation of a provision of the Senior Notes Indenture, the
Security Documents or the Senior Notes;

(8) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Senior
Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement
of a successor Trustee or Security Agent pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide
for the accession by the Trustee or Security Agent to any Notes Document;

(9) in the case of the Security Documents, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant
a security interest in favour of the Security Agent for the benefit of the Holders or parties
to the Senior Facilities Agreement, in any property which is required by the Security
Documents or the Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the later of the Issue Date
and the Completion Date) to be mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security
interest is required to be granted to the Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant
a security interest in the Collateral for the benefit of any Person; provided that the granting
of such security interest is not prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under
_"—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest" is complied with; or_

(10) as provided in "—Certain Covenants—Additional Intercreditor Agreements" or
in "—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest";

_provided that,_ only the consent of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the relevant Guarantors or
security providers shall be required to give effect to any amendment or supplement providing for additional
Notes Guarantees or security or modifying the terms of Notes Guarantees or security pursuant to clauses
(3), (6), (7), (9) or (10) above.

The Trustee and the Security Agent (where relevant) shall, at the direction of the Senior Notes Issuer,
sign any supplemental indenture or other documentation that gives effect to amendments, waivers or
supplements authorised as described under this heading "Amendments and Waivers" if the amendment,
waiver or supplement does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or the Security Agent.
Except as set forth in the preceding proviso, it shall only be necessary for the Senior Notes Issuer, the
Trustee and the Security Agent (where relevant) to authorise and execute a supplemental indenture or
other documentation in order to effect an amendment, waiver or supplement authorised as described under
this heading "Amendments and Waivers." Unless otherwise specified by the Senior Notes Issuer, a waiver
authorised as described under this heading "Amendments and Waivers" will become effective once the
requisite consent of Holders has been obtained, without execution of any supplemental indenture or other
documentation.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Senior Notes Indenture to approve the particular
form of any proposed amendment of any Notes Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the
substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Senior Notes
Indenture by any Holder of Senior Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder's Senior Notes
will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

A written consent to an amendment or a waiver by a Holder shall bind the Holder and every subsequent
Holder of that Senior Note or portion of the Senior Notes that evidences the same Indebtedness as the
consenting Holder's Senior Note, even if notation of the consent or waiver is not made on the Senior Note.
Unless otherwise specified by the Senior Notes Issuer, no Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the
written consent or waiver as to such Holder's Senior Note or portion of the Senior Note once delivered to
the Senior Notes Issuer. After an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder.

The Senior Notes Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of
determining the Holders entitled to give their written consent or take any other action. If a record date is
fixed, then only those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies)
shall be entitled to give such consent (and revoke any consent previously given, if relevant) or to take any
such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No consent shall
be valid or effective for more than 180 days after such record date.

For purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Notes have taken any action under this Senior Notes Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of Senior
Notes will be deemed to be the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Notes
as of (i) the record date in respect of such action (if a record date has been set with respect to the taking
of such action), (ii) the date the taking of such action by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount
of such Senior Notes has been certified to the Trustee by the Senior Notes Issuer, or (iii) as of a date
selected by the Senior Notes Issuer that is within the consent delivery period or no more than five Business

441


-----

Days prior to the beginning of the consent delivery period, as specified by the Senior Notes Issuer in the
relevant consent materials.

In formulating their decisions on matters set forth in this Section "Amendments and Waivers," the
Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as they
deems necessary, including Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

For avoidance of doubt, no amendment to, or deletion of, or actions taken in compliance with any of
the covenants described under, "—Certain Covenants" and any related definitions shall be deemed to
impair or affect any rights of holders of the Senior Notes to receive payment of principal of, or premium, if
any, or interest on, the Senior Notes.

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Senior Notes have concurred
in any direction, waiver or consent, the Senior Notes owned by the Senior Notes Issuer or by any Person
directly or indirectly controlling, or controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Senior
Notes Issuer (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, independent debt funds of Permitted Holders) will be
disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Senior Notes Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and the
Guarantors under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture ("legal defeasance") and cure all then
existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including those respecting the
defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee and the
obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing
temporary Senior Notes, registration of Senior Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Senior Notes and
the maintenance of an office or agency for payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject
to the foregoing, if the Senior Notes Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, the rights of the Trustee
and the Holders under the Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Senior Notes Issuer at any time may terminate its and the Guarantors' obligations under the
covenants described under "Certain Covenants" (other than clauses (1) and (2) of "—Certain Covenants—
_Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer") and "Change of Control" and the default provisions_
relating to such covenants described under "Events of Default" above, the operation of the cross-default
upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to
Holdco and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee provision and the
security default provision described under "Events of Default" above ("covenant defeasance").

The Senior Notes Issuer at its option at any time may exercise its legal defeasance option
notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. If the Senior Notes Issuer exercises
its legal defeasance option, payment of the Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of
Default with respect to such Senior Notes. If the Senior Notes Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance
option with respect to the Senior Notes, payment of the Senior Notes may not be accelerated because of
an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant
described under "—Certain Covenants—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer"), (4), (5)
(other than with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer), (6), (7) or (8) under "Events of Default" above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Senior Notes Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust
(the "defeasance trust") with the Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent) by the
Trustee for this purpose), for the benefit of Holders of Senior Notes, cash in sterling or sterling-denominated
UK Government Obligations or a combination thereof, for the payment of principal, premium, if any, and
interest on the outstanding Senior Notes to the applicable date of redemption or Stated Maturity, as the
case may be, and must comply with certain other conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant
Senior Notes will not recognise income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes
as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax
on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been
the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States must be based on a ruling
of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S. federal income tax
law);

442

creditors of the Senior Notes Issuer; and

be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that all conditions
precedent provided for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Senior Notes Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents will be discharged and
cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the
Senior Notes, as expressly provided for in the Senior Notes Indenture) as to all outstanding Senior Notes
when:

(1) either (a) all the Senior Notes previously authenticated and delivered (other
than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Senior Notes, and certain Senior Notes for which
provision for payment was previously made and thereafter the funds have been released
to the Senior Notes Issuer) have been delivered to the Principal Paying Agent for
cancellation; or (b) all Senior Notes not previously delivered to the Principal Paying Agent
for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii) will become due and payable at
their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one
year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice
of redemption by the Principal Paying Agent in the name, and at the expense, of the
Senior Notes Issuer;

(2) the Senior Notes Issuer has deposited or caused to be deposited with the
Trustee (or another entity designated or appointed as agent by the Trustee for this
purpose), for the benefit of Holders of Senior Notes, money or sterling-denominated UK
Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in an amount sufficient to pay and
discharge the entire indebtedness on the Senior Notes not previously delivered to the
Principal Paying Agent for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to the
date of deposit (in the case of Senior Notes that have become due and payable), or to
the Stated Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be;

(3) the Senior Notes Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable
under the Senior Notes Indenture;

(4) the Senior Notes Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to
apply the funds deposited towards the payment of the Senior Notes at maturity or on the
redemption date, as the case may be; and

(5) the Senior Notes Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate
and an Opinion of Counsel (which the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry
on) each to the effect that all conditions precedent under the "Satisfaction and Discharge"
section of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of the
Senior Notes Indenture have been complied with, provided that any such counsel may
rely on any Officer's Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the
foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3)).

If requested in writing by the Senior Notes Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable
notice of redemption or pursuant to the applicable Officer's Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or
such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall
distribute any amounts deposited to the Holders prior to the applicable redemption date or Stated Maturity,
as applicable, of the Senior Notes; provided that Holders shall have received at least three Business Days'
notice from the Senior Notes Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of
redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable
redemption date or Stated Maturity, as applicable, of the Senior Notes as set forth above will not include
any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To
the extent the Senior Notes are represented by a Global Senior Note deposited with a common depositary
for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants
of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of such clearing system.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Senior Notes Issuer or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Senior Notes
Issuer or any Guarantor under the Notes Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason
of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Senior Note waives and releases all such
liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Senior Notes. Such waiver
may not be effective to waive liabilities under the U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC
that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture.
The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Trustee will perform only such duties as are set forth specifically in the Senior Notes Indenture. During the
existence of an Event of Default of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice,
the Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Senior Notes Indenture and
use the same degree of care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive
rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Senior Notes Indenture will
not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Senior Notes Indenture will impose certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become
a creditor of the Senior Notes Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realise on certain
property received in respect of any such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to
engage in other transactions with the Senior Notes Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Senior Notes Indenture will set out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed,
and replaced. Such terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Notes, or may resign at any
time by giving written notice to the Senior Notes Issuer and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or
acquires actual knowledge of a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to meet certain eligibility
requirements or (c) becomes incapable of acting as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the
Senior Notes Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder for not less
than six months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of
appointment by the successor Trustee.

The Senior Notes Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss,
liability, taxes (other than net income or similar taxes), expenses incurred without gross negligence, wilful
misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Senior Notes Indenture. Except as otherwise provided in the Senior Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be
entitled to request and rely conclusively and without further investigation upon Officer's Certificates and
Opinions of Counsel in formulating its opinion or in taking any action under the Senior Notes Indenture.

**Notices**

Notices with respect to the Senior Notes will be published on the Senior Notes Issuer's website. In
addition, for so long as any Senior Notes are represented by Global Senior Notes, notices to Holders of
the Senior Notes shall be delivered via Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published
more than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices
are mailed, such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the
seventh day after being so mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such
Person by first-class mail or other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to such Holder if so
mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it
shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the
manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not the addressee receives it.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this "Description of the Senior Notes," the notice
requirements in the Senior Notes Indenture will be subject to the applicable rules and procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream for so long as the Senior Notes are held as Global Senior Notes. To the extent
the mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear or Clearstream conflict with any requirements applicable
to notices under the Senior Notes Indenture, a notice will be deemed to satisfy such requirements if it
complies with the mandatory rules and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream concerning the content,
timing and procedure for delivering notices and otherwise complies with any applicable requirements under
the Senior Notes Indenture.

**Prescription**

Claims against the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of principal, or premium, if
any, on the Senior Notes will be prescribed 10 years after the applicable due date for payment thereof.
Claims against the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors for the payment of interest on the Senior Notes
will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Sterling-Denominated Restrictions**

Sterling is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the Senior Notes Issuer
and the Guarantors under or in connection with the Senior Notes and the related Notes Guarantees,
including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than sterling, whether as a result
of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or dissolution
of the Senior Notes Issuer, any Guarantor or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any
sum expressed to be due to it from the Senior Notes Issuer or a Guarantor in connection with the Senior
Notes and the related Notes Guarantees will only constitute a discharge to the Senior Notes Issuer or such
Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent of the sterling amount which the recipient is able to purchase with
the amount so received or recovered in that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it
is not practicable to make that purchase on that date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that sterling amount received in accordance with the preceding paragraph is less than the amount
expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Senior Note, the Senior Notes Issuer and
the Guarantors will indemnify them against any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result.
In any event, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will indemnify the recipient or the Trustee on a
joint and several basis against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Senior
Note or the Trustee to certify in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Notes Issuer (indicating the
sources of information used) the loss it Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute
a separate and independent obligation from the Senior Notes Issuer's and the Guarantors' other
obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective of any
waiver granted by any Holder of a Senior Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set
out herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Senior Note or any Notes Guarantee, or to the
Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any
sterling-denominated restriction herein (i) the Sterling Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is
denominated in a non-sterling currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate
in effect on the date such non-sterling amount is Incurred or paid, as the case may be and (ii) currency
translations shall be made taking into account any cross currency derivatives entered into by the Senior
Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Where any such calculations involve the determination of a
financial metric over a period of time, they shall be made consistently with the exchange rate methodology
applied in the financial statements included in this Offering Memorandum or delivered pursuant to the
covenant described under "—Reports" for the same period.

**Listing**

Application will be made to The International Stock Exchange Authority Limited to list the Senior Notes
on the Official List of The International Stock Exchange and to admit the Senior Notes for trading on the
Exchange. There can be no assurance that any such listing will be granted or maintained.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer are located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Senior Notes Issuer, including judgments with respect
to the payment of principal, premium, interest, Additional Amounts, if any, and any redemption price and
any purchase price with respect to the Senior Notes, may not be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Senior Notes
Indenture and the Senior Notes, Holdco, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors will in the Senior
Notes Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the Borough of
Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes, and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder
shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New York. The

-----

Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the laws of England and Wales.

merger, consolidation or other business combination transaction), in one or a series of
related transactions, of all or substantially all of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and

_Notes Issuer") or a Restricted Subsidiary or one or more Permitted Holders._

Notwithstanding the preceding or any provision of Rule 13d-3 of the Exchange Act:

thereto) until the consummation of the acquisition of the Voting Stock in connection with
the transactions contemplated by such agreement,

(ii) if any "group" includes one or more Permitted Holders, the issued and
outstanding Voting Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer owned, directly or indirectly, by any
Permitted Holders that are part of such "group" shall not be treated as being beneficially
owned by such "group" or any other member of such "group" for purposes of determining
whether a Change of Control has occurred,

(iii) a "person" or "group" will not be deemed to beneficially own the Voting Stock
of the Senior Notes Issuer as a result of its ownership of Voting Stock or other securities

it owns 50% or more of the total voting power of the Voting Stock entitled to vote for the
election of directors of such Holding Company having a majority of the aggregate votes
on the Board of Directors (or similar body) of such Holding Company, and

(iv) the right to acquire Voting Stock (so long as such "person" does not have the
right to direct the voting of the Voting Stock subject to such right) or any veto power in
connection with the acquisition or disposition of Voting Stock will not cause a party to be
a "beneficial owner."

For purposes of this definition and any related definition, to the extent used for purposes of this

counting, may be incremental to pro forma adjustments made pursuant to the definition of

the application of purchase accounting in connection with any acquisition (including the
Acquisition),

caused any Reserved Indebtedness Amount to be deemed to be Incurred subsequent to the
commencement of the period for which the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is being calculated and on or
prior to the date on which the event for which the calculation of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio is

_forma_ effect (as determined in good faith by a responsible accounting or financial officer of the Senior
Notes Issuer) to such Incurrence, assumption, Guarantee, repayment, repurchase, redemption,
defeasance or other discharge of Indebtedness, and the use of the proceeds therefrom, as if the same had
occurred at the beginning of the applicable reference period; provided that (other than in connection with
making any Restricted Payment pursuant to clause (17) of the second paragraph of the covenant described

effect to (i) any other Indebtedness Incurred or deemed Incurred on the Calculation Date pursuant to the

456


-----

has been entered into with respect to a Purchase that is part of the transaction causing a
calculation to be made hereunder, Consolidated EBITDA for such period will be calculated
after giving _pro forma_ effect to such Purchase (including anticipated expense and cost
reductions and synergies as specified in the definition of "Consolidated EBITDA") as if
such Purchase had occurred on the first day of such period, even if the Purchase has not
yet been consummated as of the date of determination;

(2) the Consolidated EBITDA (whether positive or negative) attributable to discontinued
operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, or operations, businesses or group of
assets constituting a business or operating unit (and ownership interests therein), disposed
of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on a pro forma basis as if such disposition
had occurred on the first day of such period (taking into account anticipated expense and
cost reductions and synergies resulting from any such disposal as specified in the
definition of "Consolidated EBITDA" and as determined in good faith by a responsible
accounting or financial officer of the Senior Notes Issuer);

(3) the Consolidated Interest Expense attributable to Indebtedness owed by Persons
that constitute discontinued operations, as determined in accordance with IFRS, or
operations, businesses or group of assets constituting a business or operating unit (and
ownership interests therein) disposed of prior to the Calculation Date, will be excluded on
a pro forma basis as if such disposition occurred on the first day of such period, but only
to the extent that the Indebtedness giving rise to such Consolidated Interest Expense will
not be Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
following the Calculation Date;

(4) any Person that is a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be deemed
to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at all times during such reference period;

(5) any Person that is not a Restricted Subsidiary on the Calculation Date will be
deemed not to have been a Restricted Subsidiary at any time during such reference period;

(6) if any Indebtedness bears a floating rate of interest, the interest expense on such
Indebtedness will be calculated as if the rate in effect on the Calculation Date had been
the applicable rate for the entire period (taking into account any Interest Rate Agreement
applicable to such Indebtedness); and

(7) if any Indebtedness is not denominated in sterling, that Indebtedness shall be
converted into sterling in the same way as it would be converted for balance sheet
reporting purposes in accordance with IFRS.

For the purposes of the definitions of Consolidated EBITDA, Consolidated Income Taxes,
Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Net Income, calculations will be determined in
accordance with the terms set forth above.

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**General**

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes sold within the United States to QIBs in reliance on
Rule 144A will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the "144A Global Notes").

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes sold outside the United States in offshore transactions
pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without
interest coupons attached (the "Regulation S Global Notes" and, together with the 144A Global Notes,
the "Global Notes").

On the Issue Date, the Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the
name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes ("144A Book-Entry Interests") and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the "Regulation S Book-Entry Interests" and, together with
the 144A Book-Entry Interests, the "Book-Entry Interests") will be limited to persons that have accounts
with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that hold interests through such participants. Euroclear and
Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers'
securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under
the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form.

Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records
maintained in book-entry form by, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Book-Entry Interests
for the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes will be issued only in denominations of £100,000 and
in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The Group will not impose any fees or other charges in
respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in
respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit
a participant's account on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems with the interest
beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United
States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry
Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the
Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will
not be considered the owners or "holders" of Notes for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary of Euroclear and/or Clearstream
(or its respective nominee) will be considered the sole holder of the Global Notes for all purposes under
the Indentures. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants
through which they own Book-Entry Interests to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders
of the Notes under the Indentures.

None of the Issuers, the Initial Purchasers and each Registrar, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent, and
Trustee under the Indentures nor any of their respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for
any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indentures, owners of the Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive registered
Notes in certified form (the "Definitive Registered Notes") only in the following circumstances:

(1) if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the relevant Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act
as depositary and a successor depositary is not appointed by such Issuer within 120 days; or

(2) if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear
or Clearstream following an event of default under an Indenture and enforcement action is being taken in
respect thereof under such Indenture.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuers that upon request by an owner of a Book- Entry
Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the
relevant Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry
Interests and not only to the owner who made the initial request.

In such an event, the relevant Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or

487


-----

names and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream or the relevant Issuer, as applicable, (in accordance with their respective customary
procedures and based upon directions received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of
Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend as provided in
the Indentures or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, the Issuers and each Trustee, Paying Agent, Transfer Agent and
Registrar and their respective agents shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of any Definitive
Registered Note as the absolute owner thereof and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder
as such. Ownership of the Definitive Registered Notes will be evidenced through registration from time to
time at the registered office of the Issuers, and such registration is a means of evidencing title to the Notes.

The Group will not be required to register the transfer or exchange of Definitive Registered Notes for a
period of 15 calendar days preceding (i) the record date for any payment of interest on the Notes, (ii) any
date fixed for redemption of the Notes or (iii) the date fixed for selection of the Notes to be redeemed in
part. The Group is also not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes selected for
redemption or which the holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a
Change of Control Offer or Asset Disposition Offer. In the event of the transfer of any Definitive Registered
Note, the relevant Trustee and the Transfer Agent may require a holder, among other things, to furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents as described in the Indentures. The Group may require
a holder to pay any transfer taxes and fees required by law and permitted by the Indentures and the Notes.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued and a holder thereof claims that such Definitive Registered
Notes have been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, or if such Definitive Registered Notes are mutilated
and are surrendered to the relevant Registrar or at the office of the relevant Transfer Agent, the Group will
issue and the relevant Trustee (or an authenticating agent appointed by the relevant Trustee) will
authenticate a replacement Definitive Registered Note if the relevant Trustee's and the Issuers'
requirements are met. The Issuers or the relevant Trustee may require a holder requesting replacement of
a Definitive Registered Note to furnish an indemnity bond sufficient in the judgment of both the relevant
Trustee and us to protect us, the relevant Registrar, the relevant Transfer Agent or the relevant Paying
Agent appointed pursuant to the Indentures from any loss which any of them may suffer if a Definitive
Registered Note is replaced. The Issuers and each Registrar and/or Trustee may charge for expenses in
replacing a Definitive Registered Note.

In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Definitive Registered Note has become or is about
to become due and payable, or is about to be redeemed or purchased by us pursuant to the provisions of
the Indentures, the Group in our discretion may, instead of issuing a new Definitive Registered Note, pay,
redeem or purchase such Definitive Registered Note, as the case may be.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests only in
accordance with the Indentures and, if required, only after the transferor first delivers to the relevant
Transfer Agent a written certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) to the effect that such transfer
will comply with the transfer restrictions applicable to such Notes. See "Notice to Investors."

**Redemption of the Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or
their respective nominee), as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global
Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount
received by it in respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in
connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by
Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any
portion thereof). The Issuers understand that under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if
fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their
respective participants' accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on
such other basis (including by application of a pool factor) as they deem fair and appropriate in
accordance with their respective operational procedures; provided, however, that for the Senior Secured
Notes and the Senior Notes, no Book-Entry Interest of less than £100,000 principal amount may be
redeemed in part.

488


-----

**Payments on Global Notes**

The Issuers will make payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including
principal, premium, interest, additional interest and additional amounts) to the Paying Agents for onward
payment to Euroclear and Clearstream. In turn, Euroclear and Clearstream will distribute such payments
to participants in accordance with their respective procedures. The Issuers expect that standing customer
instructions and customary practices will govern payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry
Interests held through such participants.

Under the terms of the Indentures, the Issuers, the Trustees, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents,
the Registrars and any of their respective agents will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes (i.e.,
the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (or its nominee)) as the owner thereof for the
purpose of receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, none of the Issuers, the Trustees,
the Registrars, the Transfer Agents, the Paying Agents nor any of their respective agents has or will have
any responsibility or liability for:

  - any aspect of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made
by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing the records of Euroclear or Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to, or payments made on account of, a Book- Entry Interest;

  - any other matter relating to the actions and practices of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant
or indirect participant; or

  - the records of the common depositary.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers
registered in "street name."

**Currency of Payment for the Global Notes**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the
Global Notes will be paid to holders of interest in such notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream in
pounds sterling.

Payments will be subject in all cases to laws and regulations (including any regulations of the applicable
clearing system) applicable thereto. Neither the Issuers nor the Trustees nor the Initial Purchasers nor
any of their respective agents will be liable to any holder of a Global Note or any other person for any
commissions, costs, losses or expenses in relation to or resulting from any currency conversion or
rounding effected in connection with any such payment.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuers that they will take any action permitted to be taken
by a holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal
amount of the Notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction.
Euroclear and Clearstream will not exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the
taking of any other action in respect of the Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the
Notes, each of Euroclear and Clearstream, at the request of the holders of such Notes, reserves the right
to exchange the Global Notes for Definitive Registered Notes in certified form, and to distribute such
Definitive Registered Notes to their participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be done in accordance with Euroclear
and Clearstream rules and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical
delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the Notes to persons in states
which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such holder must transfer
its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream
and in accordance with the provisions of each Indenture.

The Global Notes will bear a legend to the effect set forth in "Notice to Investors." Book-Entry Interests
in the Global Notes will be subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in "Notice to Investors."
Transfers of Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests to persons wishing to take delivery of Rule 144A Book-Entry
Interests will at all times be subject to such transfer restrictions.

489


-----

Rule 144A Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a
beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Note upon receipt by the relevant Trustee and the relevant
Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indentures) from the transferor to the
effect that such transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests
may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of a Rule 144A Book-Entry Interest only
upon receipt by the relevant Trustee and the relevant Transfer Agent of a written certification (in the form
provided in the Indentures) from the transferor to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
who the transferor reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A
in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with any applicable state
securities laws.

In connection with transfers involving an exchange of a Regulation S Book-Entry Interests for a Rule
144A Book-Entry Interest or vice versa, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the
principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of
the Rule 144A Global Note or vice versa.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged for Book-Entry Interests in a Global
Note only as described under "Description of the Senior Notes—Transfer and Exchange" and "Description
_of the Senior Secured Notes—Transfer and Exchange" and, if required, only if the transferor first delivers_
to the relevant Trustee and the relevant Transfer Agent a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indentures) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable
to such Notes. See "Notice to Investors."

Any Book-Entry Interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery
in the form of a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry
Interest in the first mentioned Global Note and become a Book-Entry Interest in the other Global Note, and
accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to
Book-Entry Interests in such other Global Note for as long as it retains such a Book-Entry Interest.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may
be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures
may be discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuers, the Trustees, the Transfer Agents, the
Registrars, the Paying Agents or any of their respective agents will have any responsibility for the
performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect participants of their
respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Pledges**

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf
of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a Book-Entry Interest to pledge such
interest to persons or entities who or that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or
otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for
that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities
in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons may be limited.

**Information Concerning Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream,
as applicable.

The Issuers provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the
convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. None of the Issuers, the Initial Purchasers, the
Trustees, the Paying Agents, the Transfer Agents, the Registrars nor any of their respective agents are
responsible for those operations or procedures.

Euroclear and Clearstream hold securities for participating organisations. They also facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic
book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various
services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and
borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities
markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear
and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear
through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or
indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest
to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take
actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The
laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.
Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners
of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable
to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The Notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Official List of the
Exchange. Transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream
will be effected in the ordinary way in accordance with their respective system's rules and operating
procedures.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, they are under
no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuers, the Initial Purchasers, the Trustees, the Paying
Agents, the Transfer Agents or the Registrars will have any responsibility for the performance by
Euroclear, Clearstream or their participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under
the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes will be made in pounds sterling.
Book-Entry Interests owned through Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement
procedures applicable to conventional Eurobonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited
to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the Business Day following
the settlement date against payment for value on the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear and Clearstream and will settle
in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book- Entry Interests where both the purchaser's and the seller's accounts are
located to ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**Special Timing Considerations**

You should be aware that investors will only be able to make and receive deliveries, payments and
other communications involving the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream on days when those systems
are open for business.

In addition, because of time-zone differences, there may be complications with completing
transactions involving Clearstream and/or Euroclear on the same business day as in the United States.
U.S. investors who wish to transfer their interests in the Notes, or to receive or make a payment or delivery
of Notes, on a particular day, may find that the transactions will not be performed until the next business
day in Luxembourg if Clearstream is used, or Brussels if Euroclear is used.

**Clearing Information**

The Issuers expect that the Notes will be accepted for clearance through the facilities of Euroclear and
Clearstream. The international securities identification numbers, common codes and CUSIP numbers for
the Notes are set out under "Listing and General Information."

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON VALIDITY AND**
**ENFORCEABILITY OF THE NOTES GUARANTEES AND THE SECURITY INTERESTS**

The following is a brief description of certain insolvency law considerations in the jurisdictions in which
Notes Guarantees or Collateral are initially being provided. The descriptions below do not purport to be
complete or discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the Notes, the Notes
Guarantees or the Collateral. Proceedings of bankruptcy, insolvency or a similar event could be initiated
in any of these jurisdictions and in the jurisdiction of organisation of a future Guarantor or provider of
Collateral. The application of these various laws in multiple jurisdictions could trigger disputes over which
jurisdiction's law should apply and could adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights and to collect
payment in full under the Notes, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral, as applicable. Prospective
investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with respect to such limitations and
considerations. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our
_Indebtedness."_

**European Union**

Certain providers of Collateral are incorporated and organised under the laws of member states of the
European Union (each, a "Member State"). Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European
Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (which applies to insolvency
proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017), (the "Recast Insolvency Regulation"), which applies
within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company's
"centre of main interests" ("COMI") is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings.

Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company's COMI "shall be the place
where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable
by third parties" and that in the case of a company or legal person, COMI is presumed to be located in
the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, though that presumption shall
only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month
period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings.

Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption
as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, if the company's central administration is located in a Member
State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all
the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company's
actual centre of management and supervision and the centre of the management of its interests is located
in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when
determining the COMI of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the
debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of
the debtor's creditors are established.

This means that a company's COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time as the
determination of where a company has its COMI is depends on the facts and circumstances as at the
date the company enters an insolvency proceeding and on which the courts of the different Member States
may have differing and even conflicting views.

The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognise the judgment of the court
commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long
as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced
there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State (in which the debtor's COMI
is situated) which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on
it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove
assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g.
the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other
Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to
commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets).

If the "COMI" of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Articles 3(2) to Article
3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) only
have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings against that company if such company has an
"establishment" in the territory of such other Member State, and such insolvency proceedings must be
"secondary." Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast
Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings.

An "establishment" is defined in Article 2(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation to mean "any place
of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to

492


-----

open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets."
Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than
Denmark) will only be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the 3-month
period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings.

The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are
restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in
the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency
proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor
has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State
in which the debtor's COMI is situated because of the conditions laid down by that Member State's law;
or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises
from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member
State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or

(b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the
establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main
insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency
proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial
insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local
insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor.

In addition, the concept of "group coordination proceedings" has been introduced in the Recast
Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group
of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may
be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the
group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member
of the group. Participation by the insolvency practitioner of the relevant member of the group in the group
coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner's recommendations
or plan however is voluntary.

In the event that any of the Issuers or Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be
commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the
enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuers or Guarantors.

The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020, 11.00 p.m. ("exit day")
and therefore is no longer a Member State. The EUWA (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal
Agreement) Act 2020) provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU regulation as it had
effect in EU law immediately before exit day (subject to certain exceptions)) converts directly applicable
EU law (which includes regulations) as it stood at the end of the transition period into UK domestic law.
However, whilst direct EU legislation may continue to form a part of domestic law of the United Kingdom
after the end of the transition period, it may be subject to a number of amendments. The Insolvency
(Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) sets out a number of amendments to be made
to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, as it will apply in the United Kingdom after the end of the transition
period. On December 30, 2020 the European Union and the United Kingdom formally signed the EU-UK
Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This agreement provisionally applies from January 1, 2021, but is still
subject to formal approval by the European Parliament. At this stage, there remains considerable political,
legislative and regulatory uncertainty throughout the region and the extent to which Brexit could adversely
affect business activity, restrict the movement of capital and the mobility of personnel and goods, and
otherwise impair political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, the EU
and elsewhere. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on business activity in
the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, or the EU. Further, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not
include a replacement for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU
and vice versa. In the absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will be harder for UK
office holders and UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states
and to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private
international law rules in the particular EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel
proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office
holder has been made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less
certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state.

493


-----

**England and Wales**

The Issuers and certain of the Guarantors and providers of Collateral are companies incorporated
under the laws of England and Wales (the "English Obligors"). Therefore, any insolvency proceedings
by or against the English Obligors would likely be based on English insolvency laws. However, as
discussed in the "European Union" section above, pursuant to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, and,
where a company incorporated under English law has its COMI in a Member State of the European Union,
any main insolvency proceedings for that company could, subject to certain exceptions, be opened in the
Member State in which its COMI is located and be, subject to certain exceptions set out in Articles 8 to 18
of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, subject to the laws of that Member State.

Similarly, the UK Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model
Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign court may have jurisdiction
where any English company has its COMI in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an "establishment"
(being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic
activities with human means and assets or services).

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency
proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the
company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company, its directors or the
holder of a "qualifying floating charge" (discussed below) making an application for administration out of
court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the
case of a liquidation). The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law
relating to certain limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The
application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the
Notes Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and therefore may
limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of any English Obligor

**_The Insolvency Test_**

The Insolvency Act 1986 (the "Insolvency Act") has no test for or definition of insolvency per se but
instead relies on the concept of a company's 'inability to pay its debts' as the keystone for many of its
provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the Insolvency Act, the circumstances in which a company is
deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others, the following: (i) if it fails to satisfy a creditor's
statutory demand for a debt exceeding £750 within 21 days of service or if it fails to satisfy in full or in part
a judgment debt (or similar court order); (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company
is unable to pay its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value
of the company's assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and
prospective liabilities.

**_Administration_**

The Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 empower British
courts to make an administration order in respect to companies incorporated under the laws of England
and Wales or Scotland, companies incorporated under the laws of an EEA Member State, companies not
incorporated under the laws of an EEA Member State but having their COMI in a Member State (other
than Denmark), companies (wherever incorporated) having their COMI in the United Kingdom and
companies (wherever incorporated) having their COMI in a Member State (other than Denmark) and an
establishment (see "European Union" above) in the United Kingdom. Subject to specific conditions, a
court can make an administration order if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to
become "unable to pay its debts" and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the
purpose of administration.

Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English company, the directors of such
company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (discussed below), where the floating charge has
become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator out of court process, subject to certain exceptions
pursuant to the Insolvency Act. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that
must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably
practicable, achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely upon
immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the
creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to
one or more secured or preferential creditors.

494


-----

The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration pursuant to the
statutory moratorium imposed under the Insolvency Act. Upon the appointment of an administrator, no
step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company's property except with the consent
of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply
to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and
diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider
discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives
of administration described above.

Accordingly, if any of the Issuers, the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into
administration, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced
against that company while it was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the
administrator. There can be no assurance that the Trustees, or the Security Agent, as applicable, would
obtain this permission of the court or consent of the administrator.

In addition, while an administrator is in office, the powers of the boards of directors of the Issuers, the
Guarantors or the providers of Collateral (save those that do not interfere with the exercise of that
administrators' powers, and those permitted by the administrator) are suspended, and an administrator is
given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act,
dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A
secured creditor cannot appoint an administrative receiver while an administrator is in office although, in
certain circumstances (principally where one of the exceptions to the general prohibition on the
appointment of an administrative receiver applies as set out in the Insolvency Act), the holder of a floating
charge can block the appointment of an administrator where it can appoint an administrative receiver.

However, the general prohibition against enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the
administrator or permission of the court, and the administrator's powers with respect to property subject
to a floating charge, does not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial collateral
arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI
2003/3226) (UK) (the "Financial Collateral Regulations"). A financial collateral arrangement includes
(subject to certain other conditions) a security interest over financial collateral (including a floating charge,
a pledge, a mortgage, a fixed charge or a lien) in a company, where both the collateral provider and
collateral taker are non-natural persons.

**_Administrative receivership_**

If a company grants a "qualifying floating charge" to a party for the purposes of English insolvency law,
that party will be able to appoint an administrative receiver provided the qualifying floating charge predates September 15, 2003 or falls within one of the exceptions under the Insolvency Act to the prohibition
on the appointment of administrative receivers. In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge for these
purposes, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory
provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or
(c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by
Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if he holds
one or more debentures of the company secured: (a) by a qualifying floating charge which relates to the
whole or substantially the whole of the company's property; (b) by a number of qualifying floating charges
which together relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's property; or (c) by charges
and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's
property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the
prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to "capital market
arrangements" (as defined in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A of the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the
issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life
of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a "capital market investment" (which is
defined in the Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument).

If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court
(and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court
procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court
considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of
challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator
is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company's
property must resign if required to do so by the administrator.

495


-----

**_Liquidation/winding-up_**

Liquidation is a company dissolution procedure under which the assets of a company are realised and
distributed by the liquidator to creditors and (if applicable) members in the statutory order of priority
prescribed by the Insolvency Act. Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved
and removed from the register of companies.

There are two forms of winding-up: (i) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (ii) voluntary
liquidation, by resolution of the company's members, and which is in turn divided into members' voluntary
liquidation ("MVL") and creditors' voluntary liquidation ("CVL"). The primary ground for the compulsory
winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as described above).

The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant
company's property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court,
void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or
otherwise arising under a "financial collateral arrangement" under the Financial Collateral Regulations
and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to
certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to
have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order
is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may
be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court.

In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a
winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result,
there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act for a voluntary winding-up. There is also no
automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder
of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, in the absence of a stay being obtained, it
means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security.

A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the
shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement
by the court. Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding-up resolution, the directors must
swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after having made full enquiry into the company's
affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts, including interest and the costs
of the MVL process, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation.

A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and
has no court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory
declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors
choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors' choice will prevail.

A liquidator has, among other things, the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the
company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding-up,
to sell the company's property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge
antecedent transactions.

Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which is
any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may
give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it
gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may
be detrimental to creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract where all of the obligations
have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to
disclaim onerous property does not apply where the collateral-provider or collateral-taker under the
arrangement is being wound up, to any financial collateral arrangement.

**_Challenges to guarantees and security_**

There are circumstances under English insolvency law in which the granting by an English company
of security and guarantees can be challenged. In most cases, this will only arise if the English company
is placed into administration or liquidation within a specified period of the granting of the guarantee or
security. Therefore, if during the specified period an administrator or liquidator is appointed to an English
company, the administrator or liquidator may challenge the validity of the security or guarantee given by
such company. The Issuer cannot be certain that, in the event that the onset of an English company's
insolvency is within any of the requisite time periods set out below, the grant of a security interest and/or
guarantee in respect of the Notes would not be challenged or that a court would uphold the transaction
as valid.

**_Priority on insolvency_**

One of the primary functions of winding-up (and, where the company cannot be rescued as a going
concern, one of the possible functions of administration) under English law is to realise the assets of the
company in question and distribute the proceeds from those assets to the company's creditors.

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed
into different classes, with the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company's property applied
in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined
below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a
prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company,
distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts
due to each creditor within a class.

The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority):

  - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets
covers that indebtedness and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but
not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to the assets in which
they have a proprietary interest;

  - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the
order of priority in which expenses are paid);

  - Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors.

o Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent
company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii)
wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency
date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose
contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the
insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme ("FSCS") up to the statutory limit.

o Secondary preferential debts include (i) bank and building deposits eligible for
compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit; and (ii)
VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D
of Schedule 6 of the Insolvency Act. These rank for payment after the discharge of the
ordinary preferential debts. As between one another, all claims within each category rank
equally;

  - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security.

o This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document
that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge.
However, before distributing asset realisations to the holders of floating charges, the
Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for
distribution to unsecured creditors;

  - Fifth ranking:

o firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under
section 74(2(f)) of the Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of any
unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up
to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These debts rank
equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between

-----

any of them. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency
officeholder can only use realisations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not
entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient
to pay out all unsecured creditors;

o secondly, interest on the company's unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable
contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of
liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which preceded such
liquidation. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or
the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are
sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security
recoveries; and

o thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories
above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above
are fully paid; and

  - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining
funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company.

Subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the
relevant documentation (and provided that such terms do not contravene the Insolvency Act).

An insolvency practitioner of a company (e.g. an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator)
will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating
charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors
and expenses out of floating charge realisations) (the "Prescribed Part"). Under current law, this ringfence applies to 50% of the first £10,000 of the company's net property and 20% of the remainder of the
company's net property over £10,000, with a maximum aggregate cap of £800,000 (except where the
company's net property is available to be distributed to the holder of a first-ranking floating charge created
before April 6, 2020, in which case the maximum aggregate cap is £600,000). The Prescribed Part must
be made available to unsecured creditors unless the cost of doing so would be disproportionate to the
resulting benefit to creditors.

**_Foreign currency_**

Under English insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claims for their
debts, any debt of a company payable in a currency other than pound sterling must be converted into
pound sterling at the "official exchange rate" prevailing at the date when the company went into liquidation
or administration (if the administration was immediately preceded by a winding-up, on the date the
company went into liquidation). This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. The "official
exchange rate" for these purposes is the middle exchange rate on the London Foreign Exchange Market
at close of business, as published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published, such rate as the
court determines.

**_Connected persons_**

A "connected person" of a company granting a security interest or guarantee for the purposes of
transactions at an undervalue, preferences and invalid floating charges is a party who is (i) a director of
the company, (ii) a shadow director, (iii) an associate of such director or shadow director, or (iv) an
associate of the relevant company.

A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual's
husband, wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual's husband, wife or civil partner, or (iv) the
husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual.

A party is associated with a company if they are employed by that company.

A company is associated with another company if (i) the same person has control of both companies,
or (ii) it is controlled by a person and that person's associates have control of the other company, or (iii) it
is controlled by a group of two or more persons who also control the other company, and the groups either
consist of the same persons or could be regarded as consisting of the same persons by treating (in one
or more cases) a member of either group as replaced by a person of whom he is an associate.

A person is to be taken as having control of a company if the directors of the company or of another
company which has control of it (or any of them) are accustomed to act in accordance with his directions
or instructions, or he is entitled to exercise, or control the exercise of, one third or more of the voting power
at any general meeting of the company or of another company which has control of it. Where two or more

498


-----

persons together satisfy either of these conditions, they are to be taken as having control of the company.

The potential grounds for challenge available under English law that may apply to any security interest
or guarantee granted by an English company include, without limitation, the following described below.

**_Reviewable Transactions_**

There are five principal provisions of the Insolvency Act under which transactions entered into prior
to a company's insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue
(section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv)
transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244).

These provisions all apply where the company has gone into an English liquidation or
administration, with the exception of section 423 which can be invoked even if the company is not in
insolvency proceedings.

_Transactions at an undervalue_

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at
an undervalue, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a
gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for
a consideration the value of which (in money or money's worth) is significantly less than the value (in
money or money's worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place
within the relevant time (two years before the onset of insolvency (as described below)); and (iii) the
company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its
debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act.

The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i)
the company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on
its business; and (ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would
benefit the company.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make
such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered
into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English
company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see
"Connected persons" above), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected
person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction
or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction.

An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any
obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the
transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person
other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such
an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for
value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party
to the transaction.

_Preferences_

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the
court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company's creditors, a surety
or a guarantor for any of the company's debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or
has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a
position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position
he would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to
give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than he would have been in if the
thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of
Connected Persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (six months before the onset
of the insolvency or two years from the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a Connected
Person); and (v) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction,
unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act.

If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it
sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction.

499


-----

In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable
to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If,
however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a
connected person by reason only of being the company's employee), it is presumed that the company
intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there
was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them.

An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any
person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not
prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in
good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a
person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator
or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to
that person at a time when they were a creditor of the English company.

_Voidable floating charges_

If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation, a floating charge created by that
company over its property may be invalid if it was created at a relevant time. Where the transaction is with
a Connected Person, this means within a period of two years before the onset of insolvency. In all other
cases, this means within a period of 12 months before the onset of insolvency when the company was at
the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the
meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act.

This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically
invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation
of the charge (as consists of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest
thereon) supplied to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the charge. No court action is
required.

Section 245 of the Insolvency Act does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a
financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

_Transactions defrauding creditors_

A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue
(see above); and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person
who is making or may make a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing his interests.

It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an
undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. This provision may be used by
any person who claims to be a "victim" of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company is in
liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and, subject to
certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. The Insolvency
Act also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action. The fact that the transaction
was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defence to the claim. It will suffice that the company's
subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is
no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice.

If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make
such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not
been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order
may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with
whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property
which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without
notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such
transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the
liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction.

_Extortionate credit transactions_

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit
transaction, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit,
either: (i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain
contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary
principles of fair dealing.

500


-----

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company
up to three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation
(which is slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an
undervalue and preferences).

_Orders_

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the
court has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that
which existed before the transaction was entered into.

**_Onset of insolvency_**

The date of the onset of insolvency, for the purposes of transactions at an undervalue, preferences
and invalid floating charges, depends on the insolvency procedure in question.

In administration, the onset of insolvency is the date on which: (a) the court application for an
administration order is issued; (b) the notice of intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court; or (c)
otherwise, the date on which the appointment of an administrator takes effect.

In a compulsory liquidation the onset of insolvency is the date the winding-up petition is presented to
court, whereas in a voluntary liquidation it is the date the company passes a winding-up resolution. Where
liquidation follows administration, the onset of insolvency will be the same as the initial administration.

**_Recharacterisation of fixed security interests_**

There is a possibility that a court could find that any of the fixed security interests expressed to be
created by the Security Documents governed by English law properly take effect as floating charges as
the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether the purported fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among
other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor's ability to
deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the
security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a
purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely
to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be
described as a fixed charge.

While recharacterisation is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation
to attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant
fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in
its discretion and without the consent of the chargee.

If any fixed security interests are recharacterised as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any
unsecured creditors of the relevant English Obligor in respect of that part of the chargor's net property
which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined
preferential creditors of the chargor may have priority over the rights of the security agent to the proceeds
of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or
administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent as floating charge holder.

**_Limitation on enforcement_**

The grant of a Guarantee or Collateral by any of the chargors in respect of the obligations of another
group company must satisfy certain legal requirements. More specifically, such a transaction must be
allowed by the respective company's memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the
above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent
security can be found to be void and the respective creditor's rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be
obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith, however the relevant
legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for
each English Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the
Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would
be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If
the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be
found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside
by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances,
the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory
provisions do not prescribe when directors' duties to creditors arise, the Court of Appeal has recently held
that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is
likely to become insolvent, with "likely" in this context meaning "probable."

501


-----

Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations
to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to UK company law.

Under UK company law, subject to limited exceptions, any security granted by a charging company
incorporated in England and Wales (including security governed by law other than English or Scots law)
(together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of
Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest. While
the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security
created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and
any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security
becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become
immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English for an order to
rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has
expired. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 21-day period has been extended to 31 days under the
Companies etc. (Filing Requirements) (Temporary Modifications) Regulations 2020. These regulations
came into effect on June 27, 2020 and will expire on April 5, 2021, unless further extended by that date.

**_Security over shares_**

Security over shares granted by an English Obligor or over shares of the English Obligor are, under
English law, equitable charges, not legal charges. An equitable charge arises where a chargor creates an
encumbrance over the shares in favour of the chargee and/or transfers the beneficial interest in the shares
to the chargee but retains legal title to the shares. Remedies in relation to equitable charges may be
subject to equitable remedies or are otherwise at the discretion of the court.

**_Security over bank accounts_**

With respect to any security over bank accounts (each an "Account Charge") granted by an English
Obligor, the banks with which some of those accounts are held (each an "Account Bank") may hold a
right at any time (at least prior to them being notified of a crystallisation event under the Account Charge)
to exercise the rights of netting or set-off to which they are entitled under their cash pooling or other
arrangements with that guarantor. As a result, and if the security granted over those accounts is merely
a floating (rather than fixed) charge, the collateral constituted by those bank accounts will be subject to
the relevant Account Bank's rights to exercise netting and set-off with respect to the bank accounts
charged under the relevant Account Charge. Once the floating charge has crystallised and converted into
a fixed charge (as it would on enforcement or the occurrence of certain insolvency events with respect to
the relevant English Obligor) and the Account Bank has been formally notified of that fact, the collateral
will no longer be subject to the relevant Account Bank's netting and set-off rights.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

A scheme of arrangement is a statutory procedure, pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006,
which permits a company to enter into an arrangement or compromise with its members or creditors (or
any class of them).

The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise
of a company's liabilities with respect to its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where such company
(i) is liable to be wound-up under the Insolvency Act and (ii) has "sufficient connection" to the English
jurisdiction.

In practice, a non-English company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has
been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company's "centre of main interests" is in
England, the company's finance documents are English law governed, or the company's finance
documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately,
each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not
necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present
case.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the
proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes,
depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights
that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or
its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and
voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of
the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to
the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did
not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be

502


-----

sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and
consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as
approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a scheme of arrangement does not trigger
a moratorium of claims or proceedings.

**_Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020_**

On June 26, 2020, the Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020 ("CIGA 2020") enacted
fundamental reforms to the United Kingdom's existing insolvency and companies legislation. Some of
these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the United Kingdom
legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include the following:

_Moratorium_

Part A1 of the Insolvency Act, as introduced by CIGA 2020, provides a standalone moratorium which
can benefit certain distressed companies by giving them various protections from creditors and providing
them with a breathing space to formulate a rescue and/or restructuring plan. The moratorium is a 'debtorin-possession' process, meaning that a company in a moratorium remains under the management of its
directors, but the moratorium is supervised by an insolvency practitioner, called a 'monitor'.

Not all companies are eligible for the moratorium. Schedule ZA1 to the Insolvency Act sets out a
number of exclusions from eligibility which includes companies that are a party to capital markets
arrangements where the debt incurred (or, when entering into the agreement, expected to be incurred)
was at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement) and the arrangement
involves the issue of a capital market investment. This includes, amongst other things, secured and
unsecured debt, but the debt instrument either has to be rated, listed, traded (or designed to be rated,
listed or traded), or bonds or commercial paper issued to professional, high net worth or sophisticated
investors.

_Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_

CIGA 2020 introduced a permanent prohibition on the operation and exercise of termination clauses
and the imposition of amended terms by a supplier in contracts for goods and services, which would have
been triggered by the counterparty company being made subject to a relevant insolvency procedure. Such
procedures include winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan.
Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e. other than on the counterparty being subject to a relevant
insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of
the insolvency proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the
relevant insolvency practitioner consents or if permission is granted by the court on it being satisfied that
the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. Financial services contracts and
entities involved in financial services are not affected by this new prohibition.

_Restructuring Plan_

CIGA 2020 also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under
the Companies Act 2006 (see "Scheme of Arrangement"), but with an ability for a cross-class cram-down
to bind dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan proposed. This new standalone restructuring plan
under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 is available to any company that is liable to be wound up
under the Insolvency Act. The Secretary of State is given the express power to exclude regulated
companies providing financial services from being able to propose a restructuring plan, and may also
provide for other exclusions as to the type of debtor company or creditor entities that may be party to a
restructuring plan.

The company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are
affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed
a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members (or any class of either of them) for the purpose
of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating the effect of such financial difficulties. There is no
financial eligibility criteria, thereby making it available to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the
latter case, the plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency practitioner).

The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring
plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent's application to convene a meeting of creditors or
members. At the convening hearing, the court will examine the classes of stakeholders and whether it has
jurisdiction to make judgment on the proposed restructuring plan. Once the court is satisfied it has
jurisdiction and with the allocation of classes, it will order a meeting of each class of creditors/members
to vote on the proposed restructuring plan: details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder

503


-----

in each class, accompanied by a statement explaining the effect of the plan and state any material
interests of the directors of the company and the effect on those interests of the plan insofar as it is
different from the effects on the like interests of other persons. Creditors and members whose rights would
be affected by the restructuring or compromise arrangement must be permitted to participate in the
relevant meeting, unless they have been excluded by reason of having no genuine economic interest in
the company.

The creditors/members of a class are deemed to approve a restructuring plan if at least 75% in value
of the creditors/members of that class who are present and voting (in person or by proxy) have voted in
favour of the proposals. Unlike with a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement for a majority in
number of those creditors present and voting to vote in favour of a restructuring plan for class approval to
be given.

As stated above, a restructuring plan has an additional feature which a scheme or arrangement does
not have, a "cross-class cram down" provision. This allows the court to sanction a restructuring plan even
if not all of the relevant classes of creditors and/or members have voted in favour of it. In order for the
court to sanction a cross-class cram down the court must be satisfied that none of the dissenting classes
are any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the "relevant alternative" (being
whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring
plan were not sanctioned); and that the plan has been agreed by 75% in value of a class of creditors or
members present and voting (in person or by proxy) who would receive a payment, or have a genuine
economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. Similar to a scheme of
arrangement, a restructuring plan then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing. Although
there are no provisions which expressly set out how the court's discretion is to be exercised, the court will
draw on the principles applicable to schemes. For example, the court may refuse to grant sanction if it
considers that the restructuring plan is not just and equitable.

Parties' rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan and any
previous rights will be extinguished.

Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a
moratorium on claims or proceedings, although the directors may apply for moratorium (see above) to
provide protection pending the sanction of the plan if the relevant company is eligible.

_Statutory demands and winding-up petitions (temporary measure)_

CIGA 2020 (as amended) has temporarily suspended the ability of creditors to present a winding-up
petition during the period between April 27, 2020 and March 31, 2021 (subject to change) on the basis of
a company's inability to satisfy a statutory demand where the statutory demand was served between
March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021, unless the creditor has reasonable grounds to believe that COVID19 did not have a financial effect on the company or that the company's inability to pay its debts would
have existed even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the company. With regards to petitions
that have been presented during this period but before CIGA 2020 came into force, the court can make
such order as it thinks appropriate to restore the position to what it would have been if the petition had not
been presented. This could lead to the voiding of winding-up orders made in respect of such petitions.
Similarly, no winding-up orders may be made by the courts during this period on the basis of an inability
to pay debts if: (i) it appears to the court that COVID-19 had a financial effect on the company before the
presentation of the petition, and (ii) the court is not satisfied that the inability to pay debts would have
existed even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the company. Any winding-up orders made
during this period but before CIGA 2020 came into force will be void and the court can give directions to
the insolvency official to restore the company to its "pre-petition" position.

_So-called "Henry VIII" powers_

CIGA 2020 further confers on the UK government some extensive powers to make a range of further
amendments to corporate insolvency and governance legislation under delegated regulations. For
example, regulations may be made to amend or modify the conditions that must be met before an
insolvency procedure applies to certain entities, or the way in which the procedure applies, or to change
or disapply a person's corporate duties and liabilities.

**Scotland**

None of the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of Scotland. The Scottish security is limited
to fixed security over real estate located in Scotland and is provided by Guarantors incorporated under
the laws of England and Wales. We therefore refer you to the English law sections above in relation to
security and guarantees granted by English Guarantors in all respects, save for those specifically dealt
with below in relation to Scottish fixed security.

504


-----

In Scotland, forms of fixed security are closely tied to specific types of property. Since Scots law does
not recognise the English law concept of "equity" there is more focus on the legal formalities rather than
the intention of the parties with respect to the creation of fixed security interests. If the strict legal
requirements under Scots law are not met, there will be no security over the subject notwithstanding the
intention of the parties.

In respect of movable property, it is essential that the security holder has some form of possession
(which may take different forms) over the subject in order to create a valid fixed security interest. Scots
law does not differentiate between legal and equitable ownership of property so, for instance, in order to
create a security interest over shares in companies incorporated in Scotland, the security holder (or its
nominee) must be registered as the shareholder. Furthermore, as there is no Scottish equivalent of an
English law equitable assignment, a Scottish interest in incorporeal property will only be created when
the assignation is properly notified to the relevant parties.

Fixed charges over land and buildings situated in Scotland may only be created using a "standard
security" (which is the Scots law equivalent of a legal mortgage over an interest of land and is governed
by statute, including in relation to how the security must be enforced).

Scots law does not recognise the office of receiver except in the specific instance of a receiver
appointed by, or on the application of, the holder of a floating charge created as such by a company with
such appointments or applications being subject to the restrictions noted in the sections above relating
to English Guarantors (see in particular "—Administrative receivership" above).

**Northern Ireland**

**_Insolvency_**

We understand there are no obligors incorporated under the laws of Northern Ireland, and that an
analysis of the insolvency laws of Northern Ireland is not required. However, certain Collateral over assets
situate in Northern Ireland will be provided by companies who are incorporated in England (each a "NI**Related Security Provider").Therefore, any insolvency proceedings with respect to such NI-Related**
Security Providers are likely to be governed by the laws of England and Wales, save where the enforcement
results in the appointment of a fixed asset receiver over real property situate in Northern Ireland.

The Collateral over real property assets situate in Northern Ireland will be subject to the laws of
Northern Ireland. It will therefore be subject to the provisions of the Conveyancing and Law of Property
Acts 1881 and 1911, and will when drafted also incorporate the powers of a receiver contained in the
Insolvency (NI) Order 1989, such powers being identical to those contained in the Insolvency Act 1986.

It should be noted that the Law of Property Act 1925, which is an English statute, is not applicable in
Northern Ireland.

**_Fixed Versus Floating Charges_**

There are a number of ways in which fixed charge security granted by a NI-Related Provider has an
advantage over floating charge security: (a) an administrator appointed to a charging company can (without
the floating charge holder's consent) convert floating charge assets to cash and use such cash, or use cash
subject to a floating charge, to meet administration expenses (which can include the costs of continuing to
operate the business of the charging company) while in administration in priority to the claims of the floating
charge holder; (b) a fixed charge, even if created after the date of a floating charge, may have priority as
against the floating charge over the charged assets; (c) general costs and expenses (including the
remuneration of a liquidator) properly incurred in a winding-up are payable out of the assets of the charging
company (including the assets the subject of the floating charge) in priority to floating charge claims; (d) until
the floating charge security crystallises, a company is entitled to deal with assets that are subject to floating
charge security in the ordinary course of business, meaning that such assets can be effectively disposed
of by the charging company so as to give a third party good title to the assets free of the floating charge
and so as to give rise to the risk of security being granted over such assets in priority to the floating charge
security; (e) there are particular challenges / risks in relation to floating charge security; and (f) floating
charge security is subject to the claims of preferential creditors (such as occupational pension scheme
contributions and wages/ salaries (including holiday pay) owed to employees); from December 1, 2020
secondary preferential creditors in respect of VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC and to ring
fencing.

Under insolvency laws in Northern Ireland, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed
security interests expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges
because the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security
interests will be upheld as fixed rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on

505


-----

whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal in
the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee
in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee,
the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding
that it may be described as a fixed charge.

**_Limitation on enforcement_**

As indicated above by reference to England and Wales, any security granted by a NI-Related Security
Provider (including security governed by the laws of Northern Ireland) (together with prescribed particulars
of the relevant security) should ordinarily be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within
21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest. We therefore refer you to the English
law sections above in relation to security and guarantees granted by English Guarantors in all respects,
noting that the NI-Related Security Providers are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales.

**_Foreign currency_**

The lawful currency in Northern Ireland is pound sterling. Northern Ireland, unlike the Republic of
Ireland, does not have euro as its currency.

Under insolvency law, where creditors are asked to submit formal proofs of claims for their debts, any
debt of a company payable in a currency other than pound sterling must be converted into pound sterling
at the "official exchange rate" prevailing at the date when the company went into liquidation or
administration (if the administration was immediately preceded by a winding-up, on the date the company
went into liquidation). This provision overrides any agreement between the parties. The "official exchange
rate" for these purposes is the middle exchange rate on the London Foreign Exchange Market at close of
business, as published for the date in question or, if no such rate is published, such rate as the court
determines.

**Jersey**

**_Insolvency_**

Certain of the security providers may be incorporated under the laws of Jersey. Consequently, in the
event of an insolvency of any Jersey incorporated security provider insolvency proceedings may be
initiated in Jersey. There are two principal regimes for corporate insolvency in Jersey: _désastre and_
winding-up (including just and equitable winding-up and creditors' winding-up). The principal type of
insolvency procedure available to creditors under Jersey law is the application for an Act of the Royal
Court of Jersey under the Bankruptcy (Désastre) (Jersey) Law 1990, as amended (the "Jersey
**Bankruptcy Law") declaring the property of a debtor to be "en désastre" (a "declaration"). On a**
declaration of _désastre, title and possession of the property of the debtor vest automatically in the_
Viscount, an official of the Royal Court (the "Viscount"). With effect from the date of declaration, a creditor
has no other remedy against the property or person of the debtor, and may not commence or, except with
the consent of the Viscount or the Royal Court, continue any legal proceedings to recover the debt.

Additionally, the shareholders of a Jersey company (but not its creditors) can instigate a winding-up of
an insolvent company, which is known as a "creditors' winding-up" pursuant to Chapter 4 of Part 21 of the
Jersey Companies Law. On a creditors' winding-up, a liquidator is nominated by the shareholders. The
creditors may approve such a liquidator or apply to appoint a different liquidator. The liquidator will stand
in the shoes of the directors and administer the winding-up, gather assets, make appropriate disposals of
assets, settle claims and distribute assets as appropriate. After the commencement of the winding-up, no
action can be taken or continued against the company except with the leave of court. The shareholders
must give creditors 14 days' notice of the meeting to commence the creditors' winding-up. The corporate
state and capacity of the company continues until the end of the winding-up procedure, when the company
is dissolved. The Jersey Companies Law requires a creditor of a company (subject to appeal) to be bound
by an arrangement entered into by the company and its creditors immediately before or in the course of
its winding-up if (among other things) three quarters in number and value of the creditors acceded to the
arrangement.

**_Scheme of arrangement_**

Although it is not an insolvency proceeding, under Article 125 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court
may sanction a compromise or arrangement (a "Scheme") between a company and its creditors or
shareholders (or a class of either of them). The court may, on application of the company (or a creditor
or shareholder or, if the company is being wound up, a liquidator), order a meeting to be called at which
the Scheme will need to be agreed to by a majority in number representing:

 - 75% in value of the creditors (or class of creditors); or

506


-----

 - 75% of the voting rights of the shareholders (or class of shareholders),

as the case may be, present and voting either in person or by proxy. If the requisite majority of creditors
or shareholders (or of the relevant class of either of them) agree to the Scheme and, following such
agreement, the court sanctions the Scheme, the Scheme is binding on all creditors or shareholders (or
on the relevant class of either of them) and on the company (or any liquidator and contributories of the
company if the company is being wound up).

**_Transactions at an undervalue_**

Under Article 17 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176 of the Jersey Companies Law, the court
may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared "en
_désastre") or liquidator (in the case of a creditors' winding-up, a procedure which is instigated by_
shareholders not creditors), set aside a transaction (including any guarantee or security interest) entered
into by a company with any person (the "other party") at an undervalue. There is a five-year look-back
period from the date of commencement of the winding-up or declaration of "désastre" during which
transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the "relevant time"). The Jersey
Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without limitation)
those that define what constitutes a transaction at an undervalue, the operation of the relevant time and
the effect of entering into such a transaction with a person connected with the company or with an
associate of the company.

**_Preferences_**

Under Article 17A of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 176A of the Jersey Companies Law, the
court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared
"en désastre") or liquidator (in the case of a creditors' winding-up), set aside a preference (including any
guarantee or security interest) given by the company to any person (the "other party"). There is a 12month look-back period from the date of commencement of the winding-up or declaration of "désastre"
during which transactions are susceptible to examination pursuant to this rule (the "relevant time"). The
Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain detailed provisions, including (without
limitation) those that define what constitutes a preference, the operation of the relevant time and the effect
of entering into a preference with a person connected with the company or with an associate of the
company.

**_Extortionate transactions, onerous property, disclaimer and customary law fraudulent_**
**_dispositions_**

Under Article 17C of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Article 179 of the Jersey Companies Law, the
court may, on the application of the Viscount (in the case of a company whose property has been declared
"en désastre") or liquidator (in the case of a creditors' winding-up), set aside a transaction providing credit
to the debtor company which is or was extortionate. There is a three-year look-back period from the date
of commencement of the winding-up or declaration of "désastre" during which transactions are susceptible
to examination pursuant to this rule. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain
detailed provisions, including (without limitation) those that define what constitutes a transaction which is
extortionate.

Under Article 15 of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law, the Viscount may within six months following the date
of the declaration of "désastre" and under Article 171 of the Jersey Companies Law, a liquidator may
within six months following the commencement of a creditors' winding-up, disclaim any onerous property
of the company. "Onerous property" is defined to include any moveable property, a contract lease or
other immoveable property if it is situated outside of Jersey that is unsaleable or not readily saleable or is
such that it might give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act, and includes an
unprofitable contract.

A disclaimer operates to determine, as of the date it is made, the "rights, interests and liabilities of the
company in or in respect of the property disclaimed" and "discharge the company from all liability in
respect of the property as of the date of the commencement of the creditors' winding-up" but "shall not,
except so far as is necessary for the purpose of releasing the company from liability, affect the rights or
liabilities of any other person." A person sustaining loss or damage as a result of a disclaimer is deemed
to be a creditor of the company to the extent of the loss or damage and shall have standing as a creditor
in the désastre or creditors' winding-up. The Jersey Bankruptcy Law and Jersey Companies Law contain
detailed provisions, including (without limitation) in relation to the power to disclaim onerous property.

In addition to the Jersey statutory provisions referred to above, there are certain principles of Jersey
customary law (for example, a Pauline action) under which dispositions of assets with the intention of
defeating creditors' claims may be set aside.

507


-----

**_Enforcement of security and security in insolvency_**

Under the laws of Jersey, a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey is deemed to have
capacity to grant security governed by foreign law over property situated outside Jersey, but to the extent
that any floating charge or other security interest governed by a foreign law is expressed to apply to any
asset, property and undertaking of a person incorporated, resident or domiciled in Jersey such floating
charge or other security interest is not likely to be held valid and enforceable by the Jersey courts in
respect of Jersey situs assets.

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of
the Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and
administrators are not part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Jersey courts may not recognise the
powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs
assets.

The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey
Bankruptcy Law assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles
of comity, assist the courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to
the extent that the Royal court thinks fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the
UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a
separate law in Jersey.

If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to the company,
the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting
country's insolvency regime.

In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted that the
UNCITRAL provisions will not automatically be followed, as this is a matter for the discretion of the Royal
Court. The court's position may also not be in accordance with EU Insolvency Regulation.

Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its
directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law,
and thus the automatic test of centre of main interests does not apply.

Enforcement of a security interest against a Jersey company may be further limited by bankruptcy,
insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, re-organisation or other laws of general application relating to or
affecting the rights of creditors, and laws in relation to transactions at an undervalue, preference,
extortionate credit transactions, disclaimer of onerous property and fraudulent dispositions also apply in
Jersey.

**CERTAIN TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_Prospective purchasers of the Notes are advised to consult their own tax advisors as to the tax_
_consequences, under the tax laws of the country in which they are resident, of a purchase of Notes_
_including, without limitation, the consequences of receipt of interest and premium, if any, on and sale or_
_redemption of, the Notes or any interest therein._

**UK Tax Considerations**

The following applies only to the position of persons who are the absolute beneficial owners of Notes
and who hold Notes as a capital investment, and does not deal with certain classes of persons (such
as brokers or dealers in securities and persons connected with the Issuers) to whom special rules may
apply. The following is a summary of current UK law and published HMRC practice (which may not be
binding on HMRC) relating only to the UK withholding tax treatment of payments of interest in respect
of the Notes. The UK tax treatment of prospective noteholders depends on their individual
circumstances and may be subject to change in the future.

This description does not purport to be a complete analysis of all UK tax considerations relating to
the Notes and does not constitute legal or tax advice. Any prospective noteholders who are in doubt as
to their own tax position, or who may be subject to tax in a jurisdiction other than the United Kingdom
in respect of their acquisition, holding or disposal of the Notes, should consult their professional
advisers. In particular, holders of Notes should be aware that they may be liable to tax under the laws
of other jurisdictions in relation to payments in respect of the Notes even if such payments may be
made without withholding or deduction for or on account of tax under the laws of the United Kingdom.

**Interest on the Notes**

_UK withholding tax on interest_

Payments of interest on the Notes may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account
of UK income tax _provided_ that the Notes are and continue to be listed on a "recognised stock
exchange" within the meaning of section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007 (the "Quoted Eurobond
**exemption"). The Exchange is a recognised stock exchange for these purposes. The Notes will satisfy**
the requirements of the Quoted Eurobond exemption if they are officially listed on, and are admitted to
trading on, the Exchange in accordance with the rules of the Exchange. Provided, therefore, that the
Notes are and remain so listed, interest on the Notes will be payable without withholding or deduction
for or on account of UK tax.

In the event the Notes do not, or cease to, satisfy the Quoted Eurobond exemption, an amount must
generally be withheld from payments of interest on the Notes on account of UK income tax at the basic
rate (currently 20%), subject to such reliefs and/or exemptions as may be available.

The Notes may be issued at a price that is less than their nominal amount. Any discount element of
the redemption amount will not be subject to withholding or deduction for or on account of UK income
tax.

The Notes may be issued with a premium payable on redemption. Any premium payable on
redemption may be treated as a payment of interest for UK tax purposes and may accordingly be
subject to the withholding tax treatment described above.

_Payments by a Guarantor_

If a Guarantor makes any payments in respect of interest on the Notes (or in respect of other
amounts due under the Notes other than the repayment of amounts subscribed for such Notes) such
payments may be subject to UK withholding tax at the basic rate (currently 20%) subject to such relief
as may be available under the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty or any other
exemption which may apply. Such payments by a Guarantor may not, however, be eligible for the
exemptions from the obligation to withhold or deduct for or on account of UK tax described in the
paragraphs above.

_Further UK Tax Issues_

Interest on the Notes constitutes UK source income for UK tax purposes and may be subject to UK
income tax or corporation tax by direct assessment (including self-assessment) even where paid
without withholding or deduction. Accordingly, and subject to certain exceptions applying to various
categories of investors (including, in particular, exceptions applying to persons not resident in the United
Kingdom), investors may be subject to UK tax by direct assessment (including self-assessment) on
such payments of interest even when paid without withholding.

509


-----

Persons in the United Kingdom paying interest to, or receiving interest on behalf of, another person
may be required to provide certain information to HMRC regarding the identity of the payee or the
person entitled to the interest. In certain circumstances, such information may be exchanged with tax
authorities in other countries.

The references to "interest" in this "UK Tax Considerations" section are to "interest" as understood
for the purposes of UK tax law. They do not take into account any different definition of "interest" that
may prevail under any other tax law or that may apply under the terms and conditions of the Notes or
any related document.

**_Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax_**

No UK stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax should be payable on the issue or transfer of the Notes.

**Certain United States Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following is a discussion of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes, but does not purport to be a complete analysis of all potential
tax effects. This discussion is based upon the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the "Code"), Treasury regulations issued thereunder (the "Treasury Regulations"), and
judicial and administrative interpretations thereof, each as in effect on the date hereof, and all of which
are subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This discussion is limited to consequences
relevant to a U.S. holder (as defined below), except for the discussion on FATCA (as defined under "—
_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act"). This discussion does not address the impact of the U.S. federal_
Medicare tax on net investment income or the effects of any U.S. federal tax laws other than U.S.
federal income tax laws (such as estate and gift tax laws) or any state, local or non-U.S. tax laws. No
rulings from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS") have been or are expected to be sought with
respect to the matters discussed below. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not take a different
position concerning the tax consequences of the purchase, ownership or disposition of the Notes or
that any such position would not be sustained.

This discussion does not address all of the U.S. federal income tax consequences that may be
relevant to a holder in light of such holder's particular circumstances or to holders subject to special
rules, such as financial institutions, U.S. expatriates, insurance companies, dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities, U.S. holders whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, taxexempt organisations, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts, partnerships or
other pass-through entities or arrangements (including foreign branches) or investors in such entities
or arrangements, persons liable for the alternative minimum tax, persons holding the Notes as part of
a "straddle," "hedge," "conversion transaction" or other integrated transaction and persons subject to
special tax accounting rules as a result of any item of gross income with respect to the Notes being
taken into account in an applicable financial statement. In addition, this discussion is limited to persons
who purchase the Notes for cash at original issuance and at their "issue price" (the first price at which
a substantial amount of the applicable series of Notes is sold for money, not including sales to bond
houses, brokers or similar persons or organisations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement
agents or wholesalers) and who hold the Notes as capital assets within the meaning of section 1221 of
the Code.

For purposes of this discussion, a "U.S. holder" is a beneficial owner of a Note that is, for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, (i) an individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States; (ii) a
corporation or any entity taxable as a corporation created or organised in or under the laws of the United
States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to
U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or (iv) a trust if a court within the United States is
able to exercise primary supervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons
have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust, or if a valid election is in place to treat
the trust as a U.S. person.

If any entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes holds the
Notes, the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership will generally depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. A holder that is a partnership, and partners in such
partnerships, should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of the Notes.

510


-----

**Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisors concerning the tax**
**consequences of holding Notes in light of their particular circumstances, including the**
**application of the U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the**
**application of U.S. federal estate and gift tax laws, the U.S. federal Medicare tax on net**
**investment income, and state, local, non-U.S. or other tax laws.**

**_Effect of the IPO Debt Pushdown Provisions_**

In the event that the Issuer of the applicable series of Notes changes as a result of the provisions
described under "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown" and "Description of
_the Senior Notes—IPO Debt Pushdown" such change in the Issuer could result in a deemed exchange_
of the applicable series of Notes for "new" Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In such event,
U.S. Holders generally would recognise any gain on such exchange (although any loss could be
disallowed), and the "new" Notes could be treated as issued with original issue discount ("OID") for U.S.
federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential U.S.
federal income tax considerations in such event.

**_Characterisation of the Notes_**

In certain circumstances (see, _e.g., "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Optional_
_Redemption," "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption," "Description_
_of the Senior Secured Notes—Withholding Taxes," and_ "Description of the Senior Secured Notes—
_Change of Control" and "Description of the Senior Notes—Optional Redemption," "Description of the_
_Senior Notes—Special Mandatory Redemption," "Description of the Senior Notes—Withholding Taxes,"_
_and "Description of the Senior Notes—Change of Control,"), the Issuers may be obligated to redeem the_
Notes for an amount in excess of their adjusted issue price (plus accrued and unpaid interest), or may
be obligated to make certain payments on the Notes in excess of stated principal and interest. Although
the issue is not free from doubt, the Issuers intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies
should not cause the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable
Treasury Regulations. Assuming such position is respected, a U.S. holder would be required to include
in income the amount of any such payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in
accordance with such U.S. holder's method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The
Issuers' position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to
the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes
were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest
income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on such Notes, regardless of the holder's method of
accounting, and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognised on a sale,
exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note. The balance of this discussion
assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments. U.S. holders are
urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the potential application to the Notes of the contingent
payment debt instrument rules and the consequences thereof.

**_Payments of Stated Interest_**

Payments of stated interest on a Note (including additional amounts paid in respect of withholding
taxes and without reduction for any amounts withheld) generally will be includible in the gross income
of a U.S. holder as ordinary interest income at the time the interest is received or accrued, in accordance
with the U.S. holder's method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will
recognise interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate
of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S.
dollars at such time. A cash basis U.S. holder will not realise foreign currency exchange gain or loss
on the receipt of stated interest but may recognise exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual
disposal of the foreign currency received.

A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or
who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognised with
respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder
will recognise income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency
accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate
of exchange in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans
two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder's taxable year).
Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently
to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which
the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and cannot be changed without the

511


-----

consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of
the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the
spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of
the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal
income tax purposes will recognise foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received,
equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined at the spot
rate of exchange on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income
previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary
income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.-source and generally will not be treated as an
adjustment to interest income or expense.

**_Original Issue Discount_**

The Notes may be issued with OID for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A series of Notes will be
treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such Notes exceeds their issue price (as
defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de _minimis amount (generally,_
0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the
issue date).

In the event a series of Notes is issued with OID, U.S. holders of such Notes generally will be
required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes
on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of
accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, such U.S. holders generally will include
any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income.

The amount of any OID with respect to a Note of such series includible in income by a U.S. holder
is the sum of the "daily portions" of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or
portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to
each day in any "accrual period" a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual
period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that
each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest
occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect
to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note's "adjusted issue price" at the beginning
of such accrual period and its "yield to maturity," determined on the basis of compounding at the close
of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated
interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual
period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period.
The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all
principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price
of the Note.

OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then
translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third
paragraph under "—Payments of Stated Interest."

A U.S. holder of a Note issued with OID will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss when
OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of such Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts
attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S.
dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the
date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the
manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on such Note will be viewed first, as payment
of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent
thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of
principal. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and
be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an
adjustment to interest income or expense. The rules governing OID instruments are complex and
prospective purchasers should consult their tax advisors concerning the application of such rules to the
Notes as well as the interplay between the application of the OID rules and the currency exchange gain
or loss rules.

**_Foreign Tax Credit_**

Payments of stated interest (including OID) generally will be income from sources outside the United
States and, depending on the U.S. holder's circumstances, will generally be considered "passive"
category income for purposes of the rules regarding the foreign tax credit (or at such holder's election,
a deduction in lieu of such credit). If any non-U.S. income tax were withheld or paid in respect of

512


-----

payments on the Notes at the rate applicable to a U.S. holder, such holder may be eligible for foreign
tax credits (or, at the election of such holder, a deduction in lieu of such credits) for U.S. federal income
tax purposes, subject to applicable limitations (including holding period and at risk requirements). The
calculation of foreign tax credits involves the application of complex rules that depend on a U.S. holder's
particular circumstances. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the availability of
foreign tax credits under their particular circumstances.

**_Sale, Exchange, Retirement or other Taxable Disposition of Notes_**

A U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will equal the cost of the Note to the U.S.
holder, increased by any OID previously included in income by such U.S. holder with respect to such
Note. The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign
currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the spot rate of exchange in effect on
that date. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it
elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Note at the spot
rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. The conversion of U.S. dollars to a foreign
currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase a Note generally will not result in taxable
gain or loss for a U.S. holder.

Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally
will recognise gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realised (other
than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary
interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder's method of tax accounting as described above to
the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis
in the Note. The amount realised on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a
Note for an amount of foreign currency generally will be the U.S. dollar value of that amount based on
the spot rate of exchange on the date of taxable disposition. If the Note is traded on an established
securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the
U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method
taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt
instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis
U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognise exchange gain or loss to the extent
that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and
such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss.

Gain or loss recognised by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income
or loss and, with respect to the principal thereof, generally will be equal to the difference between the
U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder's purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the
date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S.
holder's purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired
the Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid
stated interest and, if any, accrued OID (which will be treated as discussed above under "—Payments
_of Stated Interest" or "—Original Issue Discount," as applicable) will be recognised only to the extent of_
the total gain or loss realised by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable
disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United
States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes.

Any gain or loss recognised by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognised
on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source
capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for
more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. If any
such gain is subject to foreign income tax, U.S. holders may not be able to credit such tax against their
U.S. federal income tax liability, unless such income tax can be credited (subject to applicable
limitations) against U.S. federal income tax due on other income treated as derived from foreign
sources. Alternatively, the U.S. holder may deduct such taxes in computing taxable income for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, provided that the U.S. holder does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit
for any foreign income taxes paid or accrued for the relevant taxable year. In the case of a noncorporate U.S. holder (including an individual), net long-term capital gain may be eligible for preferential
U.S. federal income tax rates compared to items of ordinary income if the U.S. holder satisfies certain
prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding how to account for payments made in a
foreign currency with respect to the acquisition, sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Note and the foreign currency received upon a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable

disposition of a Note.

**_Tax Return Disclosure Requirement_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code intended to require the reporting of certain tax shelter
transactions apply to transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain foreign
currency transactions. Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported
to the IRS, including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition
of a Note or foreign currency received in respect of a Note (including in respect of stated interest and,
if any, OID) to the extent that any such sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition or receipt
of foreign currency results in a tax loss in excess of an applicable threshold amount. U.S. holders should
consult their tax advisors to determine the tax return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment
in the Notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form 8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure
Statement).

**_Information Reporting and Backup Withholding_**

In general, payments of interest (including the accrual of OID, if any) and the proceeds from sales
or other dispositions (including retirements or redemptions) of Notes held by a U.S. holder may be
required to be reported to the IRS unless the U.S. holder is an exempt recipient and, when required,
demonstrates this fact. In addition, a U.S. holder may be subject to backup withholding with respect to
such payments or proceeds unless it provides a correct taxpayer identification number or certification
of exempt status and, in the case of payments of interest, certifies that such holder is not subject to
such withholding, and otherwise complies with applicable certification requirements. In general, a U.S.
holder may comply with this requirement by providing the applicable withholding agent with a duly
completed and executed copy of IRS Form W-9 (or substitute form).

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be
credited against a U.S. holder's U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle the holder to a refund,
_provided that the appropriate information is timely furnished to the IRS._

**_Information with Respect to Foreign Financial Assets_**

Certain U.S. holders who are individuals (and certain entities) that hold an interest in "specified
foreign financial assets" (as defined in section 6038D of the Code) are required to report information
relating to an interest in the Notes on an IRS Form 8938, subject to certain exceptions (including an
exception for Notes held in accounts maintained by certain financial institutions). If such U.S. holder
does not file a required IRS Form 8938, such holder may be subject to substantial penalties and the
statute of limitations on the assessment and collection of all such holder's U.S. federal income taxes
for the related tax year may not close before the date which is three years after the date on which such
report is filed. Under certain circumstances, an entity may be treated as an individual for purposes of
the foregoing rules. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect, if any, of this
requirement on their ownership and disposition of the Notes.

**_Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act_**

Pursuant to Sections 1471 through 1474 of the Code (provisions commonly known as "FATCA")
and subject to the proposed regulations discussed below, a "foreign financial institution" and certain
other foreign entities may be required to withhold U.S. tax on certain "foreign passthru payments" (a
term not yet defined) made after December 31, 2018 to the extent such payments are treated as
attributable to certain U.S. source payments.

Under proposed Treasury Regulations, withholding on "foreign passthru payments" on Notes that
are not otherwise grandfathered (as described below) would apply to "foreign passthru payments" made
on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the U.S. Federal Register of
applicable final regulations defining "foreign passthru payments." Taxpayers generally may rely on
these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Obligations issued on or prior to the date
that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations defining "foreign passthru
payments" are published in the U.S. Federal Register generally would be "grandfathered" unless
materially modified after such date. Accordingly, if either Issuer is treated as a foreign financial
institution, FATCA could apply to payments on the applicable series of Notes only if there is a significant
modification of such series of Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes after the expiration of this
grandfathering period. Non-U.S. governments have entered into agreements with the United States
(and additional non-U.S. governments are expected to enter into such agreements) to implement
FATCA in a manner that alters the rules described herein. Holders should consult their own tax advisors
on how these rules may apply to their investment in the Notes. In the event any withholding under

514


-----

FATCA is imposed with respect to any payments on the Notes, there will be no additional amounts
payable to compensate for the withheld amount.

**Certain Jersey tax considerations**

The following summary of the anticipated treatment of the Jersey Security Provider and holders of
Notes (other than residents of Jersey) is based on Jersey taxation law and practice as they are
understood to apply at the date of this document and is subject to changes in such taxation law and
practice. It does not constitute legal or tax advice and does not address all aspects of Jersey tax law
and practice. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their professional advisers on the
implications of acquiring, buying, selling or otherwise disposing of the Notes under the laws of any
jurisdiction in which they may be liable to taxation.

If you are in any doubt as to your tax position you should consult your professional tax adviser.

**_Taxation of the Jersey Security Provider_**

The Jersey Security Provider is not regarded as resident for tax purposes in Jersey. Therefore, the
Jersey Security Provider will not be liable to Jersey income tax other than on Jersey source income
(except where such income is exempted from income tax pursuant to the Income Tax (Jersey) Law
1961, as amended) and payments in respect of the Notes may be paid by the Jersey Security Provider
without withholding or deduction for or on account of Jersey income tax. The holders of Notes (other
than residents of Jersey) will not be subject to any tax in Jersey in respect of the holding, sale or other
disposition of such Notes.

**_Stamp duty_**

In Jersey, no stamp duty is levied on the issue or transfer of the Notes except that stamp duty is
payable on Jersey grants of probate and letters of administration, which will generally be required to
transfer the Notes on the death of a holder of such Notes where such Notes are situated in Jersey. In
the case of a grant of probate or letters of administration, stamp duty is levied according to the size of
the estate (wherever situated in respect of a holder of Notes domiciled in Jersey, or situated in Jersey
in respect of a holder of Notes domiciled outside Jersey) and is payable on a sliding scale at a rate of
up to 0.75% of such estate and such duty is capped at £100,000. Where the Notes are in registered
form and the register is not maintained in Jersey such Notes should not be considered to be situated in
Jersey for these purposes.

Jersey does not otherwise levy taxes upon capital, inheritances, capital gains or gifts nor are there
other estate duties.

prior to the date (the "Resale Restriction Termination Date") that is one year after the later of the Issue
Date and the last date on which the Issuers or any of their affiliates were the owner of such Notes (or any
predecessor thereto) only (a) to the Issuers or any subsidiary thereof, (b) pursuant to a registration
statement which has been declared effective under the Securities Act, (c) for so long as the Notes are

times within your or their control and to compliance with any applicable state securities laws and any
applicable local laws and regulations, and further subject to the Issuers', the Transfer Agents' and the
Registrars' right prior to any such offer, sale or transfer (I) pursuant to clause (e) to require the delivery of
an opinion of counsel, certification or other information satisfactory to each of them and (II) in each of the
foregoing cases, to require that a certificate of transfer in the form appearing in the Indentures is
completed and delivered by the transferor to the Transfer Agent or the Registrar. The foregoing restrictions
on resale will not apply subsequent to the Resale Restriction Termination Date.

(6) It understands that each Note will bear a legend substantially to the following effect:

THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN AND WILL NOT BE REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE "SECURITIES ACT"), OR THE SECURITIES
LAWS OF ANY STATE OR OTHER JURISDICTION. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY
INTEREST OR PARTICIPATION HEREIN MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, ASSIGNED, TRANSFERRED,
PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH
REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM, OR NOT SUBJECT TO,
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT.

In the case of Notes resold pursuant to Rule 144A:

BY ITS ACQUISITION HEREOF, THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY (1) REPRESENTS THAT (A)
IT IS A "QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER" (AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE
SECURITIES ACT ("RULE 144A")) (A "QIB") OR (B) IT IS ACQUIRING THE SECURITY OUTSIDE
THE UNITED STATES (AS DEFINED IN REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
("REGULATION S")) IN AN OFFSHORE TRANSACTION (WITHIN THE MEANING OF REGULATION
S), (2) AGREES ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ANY INVESTOR FOR WHICH IT HAS
PURCHASED SECURITIES TO OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER SUCH SECURITY,
PRIOR TO THE DATE (THE "RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE") WHICH IS ONE
YEAR AFTER THE LATER OF THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE HEREOF AND THE LAST DATE ON
WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF THIS SECURITY
(OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF THIS SECURITY) ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER, (B) PURSUANT TO A
REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE U.S.
SECURITIES ACT, (C) FOR SO LONG AS THE SECURITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE
PURSUANT TO RULE 144A, TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A "QUALIFIED
INSTITUTIONAL BUYER" AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN
ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF A QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER TO WHOM

PURSUANT TO OFFERS AND SALES THAT OCCUR OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN
COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OR (E) PURSUANT TO

REQUIREMENT OF LAW THAT THE DISPOSITION OF ITS PROPERTY OR THE PROPERTY OF
SUCH INVESTOR ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS BE AT ALL TIMES WITHIN ITS OR THEIR CONTROL

THE EFFECT OF THIS LEGEND.

If you purchase Notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply
to holders of beneficial interests in these Notes as well as to holders of these notes.

(7) It agrees that it will, and each subsequent holder is required to, give to each person to whom it
transfers the Notes notice of any restrictions on the transfer of such Notes, if then applicable;

(8) It acknowledges that the Transfer Agent and the Registrar will not be required to accept for
registration or transfer any Notes acquired by it except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us,
the Transfer Agent and the Registrar that the restrictions set forth therein have been complied with;

(9) It acknowledges that the Issuers, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and
accuracy of its acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements and agrees that if any of
the acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements deemed to have been made by its
purchase of the Notes are no longer accurate, it shall promptly notify the Initial Purchasers. If it is acquiring
any Notes as a fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, it represents that it has sole
investment discretion with respect to each such investor account and that it has full power to make the
foregoing acknowledgements, representations, warranties and agreements on behalf of each such
investor account; and

(10) It understands that no action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction (including the United
States) by us or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession,
circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other offering or publicity material relating
to us or the Securities in any country or jurisdiction where action for such purpose is required.
Consequently, any transfer of the Notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth in this Offering
Memorandum.

(11) It confirms that you, or the investor account for which you act, is not a retail investor. For the
purposes of this paragraph, the expression "retail investor" means: (a) in relation to an EEA Member
State, a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a "retail client" as defined in point (11) of Article
4(1) of EU MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive where
that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID
II; or (b) in relation to the United Kingdom, a person who is one (or more) of the following: (i) a retail client,
as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by
virtue of the EUWA, or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or
regulations made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No
600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

(12) It understands that: (i) the Notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available
to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor (as defined above) in
the EEA or the United Kingdom, and (ii) no key information document required by the EU PRIIPs
Regulation or the UK PRIIPS Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them
available to retail investors in the EEA or the United Kingdom has been prepared and therefore offering
or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or the United
Kingdom may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPs Regulation or the UK PRIIPS Regulation.

(13) It understands that none of the Initial Purchasers, or any person representing any of the foregoing,
have or will circulate in Jersey any offer for subscription, sale or exchange of the Notes without the consent
of the Jersey Financial Services Commission unless a relevant exemption to such consent applies.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

The Issuers intend to offer the Notes through the Initial Purchasers. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in a purchase agreement (the "Purchase Agreement") to be dated     , 2021, by and among,
_inter alios, the Issuers, the Jersey Security Provider and the Initial Purchasers, the Issuers have agreed to_
sell to the Initial Purchasers, and the Initial Purchasers have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase
from the Issuers, the entire principal amount of the Notes. In the event that an Initial Purchaser fails or
refuses to purchase the Notes which it has agreed to purchase, the Purchase Agreement provides that the
purchase commitments of the other Initial Purchasers may be increased or that the Purchase Agreement
may be terminated.

Each series of Notes will initially be offered at the respective prices set forth for such series of Notes on
the cover page hereof. After the initial Offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may,
from time to time, be varied by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers reserve the right
to withdraw, cancel or modify offers to investors and to reject orders in whole or in part. The Initial
Purchasers may participate in the offer or sale of the Notes through certain of their affiliates or through
registered broker dealers.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by
counsel. The Purchase Agreement also provides that the Issuers will indemnify the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that
the Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and
other charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering
price set forth on the cover page hereof. The Issuers have agreed to pay the Initial Purchasers certain
customary fees for their services in connection with this Offering and to reimburse them for certain out-ofpocket expenses. The Issuers have also agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers
against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act, or to contribute to payments that the
Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect of those liabilities.

**Notes Are Not Being Registered under the Securities Act**

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made acknowledgements, representations and
agreements as described under "Notice to Investors."

The Notes and the Notes Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act
or any state securities laws and may not be offered or sold in the United States unless the Notes are
registered under the Securities Act, or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act is available. The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes for resale in transactions not requiring
registration under the Securities Act or applicable state securities laws, including sales pursuant to Rule
144A and in reliance on Regulation S. Each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has agreed that it
will not offer or sell the Notes except to persons it reasonably believes to be "qualified institutional buyers"
(as defined in Rule 144A) in reliance on Rule 144A or pursuant to offers and sales that occur in offshore
transactions (as defined in Regulation S) outside of the United States in reliance on Regulation S. For a
description of certain further restrictions on resale or transfer of the Notes, see "Notice to Investors."

**UK PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to UK Retail Investors**

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered,
sold or otherwise made available and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any Notes to any retail
investor in the United Kingdom. For the purposes of this provision, the expression "retail investor" means
a person who is one (or more) of the following:

(i) a retail client as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part
of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or

(ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the FSMA and any rules or regulations
made under the FSMA to implement the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer
would not qualify as a professional client, as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of UK MiFIR.

Consequently no key information document required by the UK PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling
the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the United Kingdom has been prepared
and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the
United Kingdom may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPS Regulation.

519


-----

**Other UK regulatory restrictions**

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented, warranted
and agreed that it:

(a) has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section
21 of the FSMA) received by it in connection with the issuance or sale of any Notes in circumstances in
which section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to the communication; and

(b) has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

**EU PRIIPS Regulation/Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors**

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser has represented and agreed that it has not offered,
sold or otherwise made available to and will not offer, sell or otherwise make available any securities to any
retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i)
a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of
the Insurance Distribution Directive, where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of EU MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by
the EU PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail
investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making
them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the EU PRIIPS Regulation.

**Prohibition of Sales in Jersey**

In the Purchase Agreement, each Initial Purchaser, severally and not jointly, has represented, warranted
and agreed that it has not and will not circulate in Jersey any offer for subscription, sale or exchange of the
Notes without the consent of the Jersey Financial Services Commission unless a relevant exemption to
such consent applies.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, the EEA, Canada and the
United Kingdom, by any of the Issuers, the Guarantors or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public
offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this Offering Memorandum or any other
material relating to the Issuers, the Guarantors, the Notes or the Notes Guarantees in any jurisdiction where
action for this purpose is required. Accordingly, the Notes may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly,
and neither this Offering Memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with
the Notes may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance with
any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This Offering Memorandum does
not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or
solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this Offering Memorandum comes are
advised to inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering of the Notes,
the distribution of this Offering Memorandum and resale of Notes. See "Notice to Investors."

The Initial Purchasers expect to make offers and sales both inside and outside the United States through
their selling agents. Any offers and sales in the United States will be conducted by broker-dealers registered
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Certain Initial Purchasers are not broker-dealers registered with the SEC and, therefore, may not make
sales of any Notes in the United States, except in compliance with applicable U.S. laws and regulations.
To the extent that such Initial Purchasers intend to effect sales of the Notes in the United States, they will
do so only through one or more U.S. registered broker-dealers or otherwise as permitted by applicable U.S.
securities law. If a jurisdiction requires that the Offering be made by a licensed broker or dealer and the
Initial Purchasers or any affiliate of the Initial Purchasers is a licensed broker or dealer in that jurisdiction,
the Offering shall be deemed to be made by the Initial Purchasers or such affiliate on behalf of the Issuers
in such jurisdiction.

**Settlement**

The Issuers expect that delivery of the Notes will be made to investors on or about     , 2021, which
will be the      business day following the date of this Offering Memorandum (such settlement being
referred to as "T+     "). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"), trades in the secondary market are required to settle in two business days, unless
the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, the purchasers who wish to trade on
the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next      succeeding business days will be required, by
virtue of the fact that the Notes initially settle in T+    , to specify an alternate settlement arrangement

520


-----

at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to trade the
Notes prior to their date of delivery hereunder should consult their own advisors.

**No Sales of Similar Securities**

The Issuers and the Guarantors have agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of,
except as provided under the Purchase Agreement, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the
Issuers, the Target or any of their respective subsidiaries, and having a tenor of more than one year (other
than the Notes and the Guarantees) during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement through
and including the date that is 30 days after the Issue Date, without the prior written consent of Barclays
Bank plc as representative of the several Initial Purchasers of the Notes under the Purchase Agreement.

**New Issue of Securities**

There is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In addition, the Notes are subject to
certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under "Notice to Investors." The Issuers will apply
for the Notes to be admitted to the Official List of the Exchange; however, neither of the Issuers can assure
you that the relevant Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. Accordingly,
no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes, nor that you will be able
to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices that you receive when you sell will be favourable.

The Initial Purchasers may, but are not obligated to, make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law after completion of this Offering. Any market making activity may be discontinued at any
time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market making
activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the U.S. Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act.
Accordingly, the Issuers cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid
if it does develop or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price that will be
favourable to you, if at all. If the Notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering
price, depending on prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities, the operating performance
and financial condition of the Issuers, the Target and their respective subsidiaries, general economic
conditions and other factors.

**Overallotment, Price Stabilisation and Short Positions**

In connection with the Offering, the Initial Purchasers may purchase and sell the Notes in the open
market and may, but are under no obligation to, engage in overallotment, stabilising transactions, covering
transactions and penalty bids in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Overallotment involves
sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser.
Stabilising transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying Note so long as the stabilising bids do
not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market
after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial
Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that
broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilising or covering transaction to cover short positions.

In connection with the Offering, Barclays Bank plc (the "Stabilisation Manager"), or persons acting on
its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilise, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes.
Specifically, the Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in
the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilisation
Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot either the Offering (which involves sales in
excess of the offering size), creating a short position for the Initial Purchasers, and may bid for and purchase
Notes in the open market to cover such short position. In addition, the Stabilisation Manager, or persons
acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by
applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. This occurs when a particular Initial Purchaser
repays to the Initial Purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the
Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, have repurchased Notes sold by or for the account
of such Initial Purchaser in stabilising or short covering transactions. These activities may stabilise or
maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The
Stabilisation Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time.
Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes.

These stabilising transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes
to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin
on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if
commenced, may be discontinued at any time without notice at the sole discretion of the Stabilisation
Manager. If these activities are commenced, they must end no later than the earlier of 30 calendar days

521


-----

after the Issue Date and 60 calendar days after the date of the allotment of the Notes. These transactions
may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise. None of the Issuers nor any of the Initial
Purchasers make any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the
transactions described above may have on the price of the Notes.

**Other Relationships**

The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates are full-service financial institutions engaged in
various activities, which may include securities trading, commercial and investment banking, financial
advisory, investment management, investment research, principal investment, hedging, financing and
brokerage activities. The Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates have, from time to time, performed,
and may currently and/or, in the future perform, various financial advisory (including buy-side advisory
services by Morgan Stanley and/or its affiliates, and Merrill Lynch International and/or its affiliates, to TDR
Capital LLP and Mohsin Issa CBE and Zuber Issa CBE), investment and corporate banking, commercial
lending and banking, hedging, consulting and other commercial services in the ordinary course of business
for the Issuers, the Target, TDR Capital LLP and Mohsin Issa and Zuber Vali Issa and their respective
subsidiaries, affiliates or portfolio companies, as applicable, and may have from time to time in the past
held, and may in the future hold, positions in each of the Issuers', the Target's, TDR's and Mohsin Issa's
and Zuber Vali Issa's and their respective subsidiaries', affiliates' or portfolio companies', as applicable,
securities or enter into hedging or general derivative transactions with the Issuers, the Target, TDR Capital
LLP and Mohsin Issa and Zuber Vali Issa and their respective subsidiaries, affiliates or portfolio companies,
as applicable, in the ordinary course of business, for which they received or will receive customary fees
and commissions and reimbursement of expenses.

In addition, some or all of the Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates are arrangers of and/or
lenders under the Revolving Credit Facilities, Term Loan Facilities, Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility,
Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and/or Senior Bridge Facility entered into in connection with the
Acquisition. In the event that the Acquisition Closing Date occurs prior to the Issue Date, the proceeds of
the Offering will be used to repay the lenders under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and the Senior
Bridge Facility in full and they will also be used to repay a portion of Facility B, and the Initial Purchasers or
their respective affiliates will therefore each receive a portion of the proceeds of the Offering, where
applicable. Such entities may act as counterparties in the hedging arrangements the Issuers, the Target
and their respective subsidiaries execute in the ordinary course of business and/or expect to enter into in
connection with the Transactions. The commitments of each of the lenders under the bridge facilities (other
than the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility) will be terminated upon the later of completion of the offering
of the Notes and, if the Issue Date occurs prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, release of the proceeds
of the offering of the Notes from escrow. Barclays Bank plc will also act as facility agent for the Revolving
Credit Facilities, Term Loan Facilities and Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, and as security agent for the
Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes, the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Term Loan Facilities, the
Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and the Intercreditor Agreement. Barclays Bank plc will also act as agent
and will be a lender under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement. The Initial Purchasers
or their respective affiliates will receive customary fees and commissions for their services in such
capacities. See "The Transactions."

In the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may make or
hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of
their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the
Issuers, the Target or their respective affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may receive
allocations of the Notes (subject to customary closing conditions), which could affect future trading of the
Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with either of the
Issuers, the Target or their respective affiliates routinely hedge their credit exposure to them, and the Initial
Purchasers or their affiliates may in the future otherwise act as hedge counterparties to the Issuers, the
Target or their respective subsidiaries, in each case consistent with their customary risk management
policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into
transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions
in the securities of the Issuers, the Target or their respective subsidiaries, including potentially the Notes
offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered
hereby. The Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations or publish
or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold,
or recommend to partners that they acquire, long or short positions in such securities and instruments.

**LEGAL MATTERS**

Certain legal matters in connection with the Offering will be passed upon for us by Latham &
Watkins (London) LLP, as to U.S. Federal, New York state law and English law, by Appleby (Jersey)
LLP, as to Jersey law, by Brodies LLP, as to Scots law, and by Arthur Cox, as to Northern Irish law.
Certain legal matters in connection with the Offering will be passed upon for the Initial Purchasers by
Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, as to U.S. federal and New York state law, by Clifford Chance LLP, as
to English law, by Ogier (Jersey) LLP, as to Jersey law, by Burness Paull LLP, as to Scots law and by
McKees, as to Northern Irish law.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

The consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the years ended December
31, 2017, 2018 and 2019 included in this Offering Memorandum have been audited by Ernst & Young
LLP, independent auditors, as stated in their reports appearing herein. Ernst & Young LLP is a member
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.

The audit reports of Ernst & Young LLP for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019,
which are included in this Offering Memorandum, include a statement, in accordance with guidance
issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, that Ernst & Young LLP does
not assume responsibility to anyone (including holders of Notes) other than the Company and the
Company's members as a body, for its audit work, audit reports or opinions it has formed. Ernst &
Young LLP has undertaken its audit work, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies
Act 2006, to state to the Company's members those matters that it is required to state to them in an
auditor's report and for no other purpose.

Investors in the Notes should understand that these statements are intended to disclaim any
liability to parties (such as purchasers of the Notes) other than to the Company and its subsidiaries
with respect to those reports. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a
registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under
the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court)
were to give effect to the limitation above, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against
the independent auditors based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they
relate could be limited. The extent to which auditors have responsibility or liability to third parties is
unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, and the legal effect of
these statements in the audit reports is untested in the context of an offering of securities. The inclusion
of the language referred to above, however, may limit the ability of holders of the Notes to bring any
action against our auditors for damages arising out of an investment in the Notes.

under the Securities Act, the Group will, during any period in which it is neither subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, nor exempt from the reporting requirements
under Rule 12g3-2(b) of the Exchange Act, provide to the holder or beneficial owner of such restricted
securities or to any prospective purchaser of such restricted securities designated by such holder or
beneficial owner, in each case upon the written request of such holder, beneficial owner or prospective
purchaser, the information required to be provided by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

The Group is currently not subject to the periodic reporting and other information requirements of the
Exchange Act. However, pursuant to the Indentures, it will agree to furnish periodic information to the
holders of the Notes. See "Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports" and
"Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Reports." Copies of the Indentures may
also be obtained by request to the Issuers.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS**

The Issuers and the Guarantors are companies incorporated under the laws of England and
Wales. All the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and the Guarantors live outside the United
States. Substantially all of the assets of the directors and executive officers of the Issuers and of the
Guarantors are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for you to serve
process on such persons, the Issuers or the Guarantors in the United States or to enforce judgments
obtained in U.S. courts against them or the Issuers based on civil liability provisions of the securities
laws of the United States.

**England and Wales and Scotland**

The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in
England and Wales and Scotland is based upon advice provided to us by U.S., English and Scottish
legal advisers. The United States and England and Scotland currently do not have a treaty between them
providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards)
in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or
state court in the U.S. based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities
laws, would not automatically be recognised and/or enforced in England and Wales or in Scotland. In
order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales or Scotland, proceedings must first be
initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales or Scotland (as applicable). In
such an action, an English or Scottish court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original
matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to
obtain summary judgment (or summary decree in Scotland) on such a claim (assuming that there is
no good defence to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English or Scottish court
in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

    - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English
or Scottish conflicts of laws principles and rules of English or Scottish private international law;

    - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause;

    - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money;

    - the U.S. judgment not contravening English or Scottish public policy or the Human Rights Act
1998;

    - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like
nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a nonEnglish or non-Scottish penal or revenue law;

    - the U.S. judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980;

    - the U . S . judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English or Scottish
principles of natural justice;

    - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English or Scottish court in respect of
the same matter involving the same parties; and

    - the English or Scottish enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation
period.

If an English or Scottish court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English
or Scottish judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. The judgment
creditor is able to utilise any method or methods of enforcement available to him/her at the time. In
addition, it may not be possible to obtain an English or Scottish judgment or to enforce that judgment if
the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, if the judgment debtor has any
set-off or counter-claim against the judgment creditor or if an appeal is pending or anticipated against the
judgment or against the foreign judgment.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales or Scotland
judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts.
However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognised and/or enforced in England and
Wales or Scotland. In addition, it is questionable whether an English or Scottish court would accept
jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England and Wales or
Scotland, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**Northern Ireland**

The United States and the United Kingdom do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (although the United States and the United
Kingdom are both parties to the New York Convention on Arbitral Awards). Any judgment rendered by
any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon

525


-----

U.S. federal securities law, would not be directly enforceable in Northern Ireland. In order to enforce such
a monetary judgment in Northern Ireland, under common law rules proceedings must be initiated by way
of civil law action on the judgment debt before a Northern Irish Court. Summary judgment may be applied
for and in this type of action, a Northern Irish court generally will not (subject to among other things, the
matters identified below) reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court if:

    - the relevant U.S. court had territorial, procedural and substantive jurisdiction (under the UK
rules of private international law applicable to Northern Ireland) to give the judgment; and

    - the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not
being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine
or other penalty or otherwise based on a U.S. law that a Northern Irish Court considers to be a
penal, revenue or other public law).

A Northern Irish court may refuse to enforce such a judgment for reasons including if it is established
that:

    - the enforcement of such judgment would contravene natural justice, public policy or statute in
Northern Ireland;

    - the enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the
amount of the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum
assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained);

    - the Northern Irish proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period;

    - before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had been the
subject of a final judgment of a Northern Irish Court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose
judgment is enforceable in Northern Ireland;

    - the judgment has been obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles of natural
justice were breached;

    - the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which
the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to whose
jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit); or

    - an order has been made and remains effective under section 9 of the UK Foreign Judgments
(Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933, applying that section to U.S. courts, including the relevant
U.S. court.

If a Northern Irish Court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the Northern Irish
judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. In addition, it may not be
possible to obtain a Northern Irish judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is or
becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or
counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Notwithstanding the above there can be no assurance that
any judgment described will be recognised or enforceable in Northern Ireland. In addition there can be no
assurance that a Northern Irish Court will accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action
was commenced in Northern Ireland, instead of the United States, and predicated solely on US federal
securities law.

**Jersey**

The United States and Jersey currently do not have a treaty providing for the reciprocal recognition
and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters.
Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States
based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not
automatically be recognised or enforceable in Jersey. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in
Jersey, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in Jersey. In such an
action, a Jersey court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the
U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment
on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S.
judgment by a Jersey court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following:

  - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to Jersey conflicts
of laws principles;

  - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and
unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a debt or definite sum of money
(although there are circumstances where non-money judgments may also be recognised);

  - the recognition or enforcement of the U.S. judgment not contravening Jersey public policy;

  - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like

526


-----

nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine;

  - the U.S. judgment not having been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a
sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damages sustained and not being otherwise in
breach of Section 5 of the United Kingdom Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (as extended
to Jersey by the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (Jersey) Order 1983);

  - the U.S. judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of Jersey principles of natural
justice or rights under the European Convention on Human Rights; and

  - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of a Jersey court in respect of the same
matter.

Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in Jersey judgments in civil and commercial
matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, there can be no assurance
that those judgments will be recognised or enforceable in Jersey. In addition, it is questionable whether a
Jersey court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in
Jersey, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

Interim Financial Statements
30 September 2020
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

**Note 1. General information**

ASDA Group Limited ('the Company') is a private company limited by share capital, incorporated and domiciled in
England under the Companies Act 2006 (registration number 1396513).

The principal activities of ASDA Group Limited and its subsidiaries (the 'Group') are the retailing of food, clothing,
general merchandise products, fuel and services throughout the United Kingdom and online.

Sales are affected to a relatively limited extent by seasonal variations due to customers' shopping habits. As a
result, our revenue has historically been comparatively higher during Christmas and Easter periods

**Note 2. Basis of preparation**

The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements represent the consolidated
results of the Group. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared
in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union.

In accordance with IAS 34, interim financial information is prepared solely in order to update the most recent annual
consolidated financial statements prepared by the Group, placing emphasis on new activities, occurrences and
circumstances that have taken place during the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020 and not duplicating
the information previously published in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31
December 2019. Therefore, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the
information that would be required in complete consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union ("adopted IFRS"). In view of the
above, for an adequate understanding of the information, these condensed consolidated interim financial
statements must be read together with Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December
2019 prepared in accordance with adopted IFRS and approved by the Board of Directors on 25 March 2020 (the
2019 Annual Report and Accounts).

In determining the information to be disclosed in the notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial
statements, management of the Company has, in accordance with IAS 34, taken into account the materiality of the
Company and the Group in relation to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements.

Unless otherwise stated, the accounting policies applied, and the judgements, estimates and assumptions made
in applying these policies, are consistent with those used in preparing the consolidated financial statements of the
Group for the year ended 31 December 2019.

The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundreds of
thousands of pounds (£0.1m) except where otherwise stated.

These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in
section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for the prior financial year has been filed
with the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's report on those accounts was not qualified, did not include a
reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the report and
did not contain statements under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006.

The Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity is presented on 31 December 2018, as previously
reported, and restated as at 1 January 2019 for the application of IFRS 16 Leases ("IFRS 16"). Please refer to the
2019 Annual Report and Accounts for further detail on the first-time adoption of IFRS 16.

The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2020 have been
prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have determined that the Group has sufficient resources,
under current and expected future ownership (see note 15), to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of 18
months from the date of approval of the accounts.

In assessing the Group's ability to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have tested the ability of the Group
to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the 18 months, following the date of approval of the accounts, in the event
of various cashflow scenarios, including a severe but plausible downside scenario. This severe but plausible
downside scenario considers the continued economic and social uncertainty surrounding the outbreak and spread
of COVID-19 and overlays a more significant decline in cashflows, including the restriction of the sale of nonessential items, than previously and currently experienced during lockdowns. A further lockdown in early Q2 2021
is also included in this scenario. Mitigating actions that are in the control of management have been considered
such as reducing non-essential capex and discretionary spend. Under the new financing structure, it takes a
consistent 10% reduction in sales (from the base case), over a 16 month period with no mitigating actions
undertaken, in order for the Group to fully utilise all facilities available. The Directors consider the possibility of this
to be remote.

In making the assessment the Directors have also considered the Group's ability to meet its anticipated future
financing obligations as a result of the proposed new ownership, including compliance with financial covenants,
and the announced voluntary payment of business rates relating to the rates period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021,
see note 15 for further details.

### F-6

Interim Financial Statements
30 September 2020
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

Under all scenarios modelled the Directors are comfortable that there is adequate headroom when considering
both existing committed facilities under current ownership and anticipated available facilities under the expected
future ownership (see note 15). The directors have determined that there are no material uncertainties on the
Group's ability to continue as a going concern to disclose.

**New standards, interpretations and amendments effective**

A number of standards, interpretations and amendments became effective for the current reporting period. The
applications of these amendments have not had any material impact on these condensed consolidated interim
financial statements.

**Note 3. Segmental reporting**

The Group is engaged in a single reportable operating segment of business, being the retailing of food, clothing,
general merchandise, fuel and services in a single geographical segment, the United Kingdom and online. The
Group is not reliant on any individual major customers.

In line with the Group's reporting framework and management structure, key operating decisions are made by the
Executive Board, which is considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Group and are based on
revenue figures. All significant revenue is generated by the sale of goods through retail outlets in the UK and
through the Group's online channels. The operations of all product areas of the business are subject to similar
economic characteristics and are sold in a similar retail environment.

The Group has taken these factors into account together with the core principles of IFRS 8 "Operating Segments"
in determining that it has a single reportable operating segment.

The analysis of the Group's revenue for the nine-month periods ended 30 September 2020 and 30 September
2019 are as follows:


**9 months ended**
**30 September**
**2020**


**9 months ended**
**30 September**
**2019**


Sale of goods 14,749.6 14,320.5

Fuel 1,839.8 2,452.5

16,589.4 16,773.0

**Note 4. Intangible assets**

Intangible assets include brand license, goodwill and software development costs. Management has considered
indicators, compared actual performance to forecasts used in December 2019 (please see the Annual report and
financial statement for the year ended 31 December 2019 for further details) and have concluded that no indicators
of impairment exist at the reporting date.

**George brand licence**

This asset relates to the acquisition in 2006 of a perpetual licence to use the George brand and has a carrying
value of £17.3m (September 2019: £17.3m and December 2019: £17.3m). There have been no material
movements in the period.

**Goodwill**

The total net book value of goodwill is £508.0m. Goodwill of £482.3m (September 2019: £482.3m and December
2019: £482.3m) arose on the acquisition of Netto Foodstores Limited on 13 April 2011 and £17.0m (September
2019: £17.0m and December 2019: £17.0m) of goodwill arose on the acquisition of Turkmen Tedarik Hizmetleri on
26 April 2012. There have been no material movements in the period.

**Software and development costs**

The net book value of software and development costs of £134.4m (September 2019: £114.1m and December
2019: £110.7m) has increased since 31 December 2019 due to additions of £54.3m offset by £30.6m of
amortisation charged in the period.

**Note 5. Income tax**

The Group calculates the income tax expense for the period using the tax rate that would be applicable to the
expected total annual earnings. The effective tax rate for the periods presented has been established based on
management's best estimate of the annual tax rate and full year profit before tax.

Interim Financial Statements
30 September 2020
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

In the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020, the income tax expense amounted to £83.4m (2019: £43.1m)
with respect to a profit before tax of £480.6m (2019: £357.9m). The effective tax rate differs from the nominal tax
rate mainly due to tax reliefs applicable to the Group. The effective tax rate has increased in the period ending 30
September 2020 due to the available tax reliefs surrendered from elsewhere in the group being lower in the current
period.

**Note 6. Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is made up of freehold properties, leasehold improvements, assets under
construction and plant, equipment, fixtures & fittings.

The net book value of property, plant and equipment at 30 September 2020 was £8,382.4m (September 2019:
£8,467.7m and December 2019 £8,509.3m). The decrease since 31 December 2019 is largely due to depreciation
of £296.6m (September 2019: £300.7m and December 2019: £401.2m) offset by additions of £175.7m (September
2019: £179.5m and December 2019: £325.1m). There were no additions or disposals in the period that were
individually material.

**Note 7. Operating costs**

The operating profit from continuing operations is stated after (charging)/crediting the following:


**9 months ended**

reviews in the period, impairment charges of £1.1m (2019: £60.1m) were recognised in operating costs during the
period.

Impairment charges in the prior period primarily relate to three fulfilment centres. Following a strategic review of
the estate, which included a detailed assessment by the Directors of the financial performance of individual sites
in the property estate, updates were made to forecasts of future site-by-site profitability and consequently, the value
in use of these three sites was determined to be lower than both book value and fair value.

**Note 8. Financial instruments**

The fair values of the Group's financial derivatives and fixed rate borrowings with fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate
parent company have been calculated based on observable unquoted interest rates, and are categorised as Level
2 within the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement'. Level 2 inputs are inputs

other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. The fair value of
these are as follows; fixed rate borrowings of £3,208.3m (September 2019: £3,070.1m and December 2019:
£3,099.3m), derivative assets of £8.4m (September 2019: £35.6m and December 2019: £3.1m) and derivative
liabilities of £10.2m (September 2019: £1.2m and December 2019: £19.1m). The fair value of these assets and
liabilities are equal to the carrying value.

Disclosures relating to the valuation techniques and inputs pertaining to financial instruments measured at fair
value are included in the Group's 2019 Annual Report and Accounts.

**Note 9. Employee benefits**

Historically, the Group has provided retirement benefits for eligible employees through two defined benefit plans in
the UK – one funded, the ASDA Group Pension Scheme ("AGPS" or "the Scheme") and one unfunded, the
Unapproved Unfunded Retirement Benefit Scheme ("UURBS"). The AGPS was subject to a buy-in transaction
("the buy-in") on 17 October 2019 through the purchase of a bulk purchase annuity ("BPA") policy with the insurer
Rothesay Life PLC, under which the benefits payable to all AGPS pensioners and deferred members have become
fully insured. The buy-in eliminated the asset ceiling/onerous liability, which was £1,086.2m at 30 September 2019.
Please see the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts for further detail.

The amounts recognised in the Condensed Consolidated balance sheet are as follows:

**30 September** **31 December** **30 September**
**2020** **2019** **2019**

**£ m** **£ m** **£ m**

Net asset/(liability) for defined benefit pension
scheme 72.6 314.3 (784.6)

The fair value of scheme assets has increased from 31 December 2019 mainly due to the return on plan assets
(excluding interest income) amounting to £292.4m and interest income of £44.9m, partially offset by the repayment
of buy-in loan of £139.5m and benefits paid of £76.9m.

Present value of scheme liabilities have increased from 31 December 2019 for the effect of the change in financial
assumptions amounting to £380.9m and interest expense of £41.1m, partially offset by the aforementioned benefits
paid.

Total costs charged to the Condensed Consolidated income statement in respect of pension plans for the ninemonth periods ended 30 September 2020 and 30 September 2019 are as follows:

**Note 10. Right-of-use assets**

The Group leases various offices, stores, warehouses, vehicles and equipment under agreements within the scope
of IFRS 16. Leases of land and buildings have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights, however they
commonly include either a market rent review or index linked rent review with a cap and collar. The timing of when
rent reviews take place differs for each lease. They have no purchase options. The average remaining lease term
is 34 years.

Leases of plant, vehicles and equipment have various terms but typically do not include mid-term rent reviews or
extension options. They have no purchase options. The average remaining lease term is 3 years.

Additions in the period primarily relate to renewals or modifications of previously existing leases.

The net book value of right-of-use assets at 30 September 2020 was £2,157.2m (September 2019: £2,206.2m and
December 2019 £2,234.7m). The decrease since 31 December 2019 is largely due to depreciation of £114.8m
(September 2019: £116.7m and December 2019: £155.7m) offset by additions of £44.5m (September 2019:
£62.1m and December 2019: £137.7m).

**Note 11. Lease liabilities**

The Group's lease portfolio is as described in Note 10. The reconciliation between the opening and closing position
for lease liabilities in the period is described below.

Lease liabilities as at 30 September 2020 were £2,144.0m (September 2019: £2,155.4m and December 2019:
£2,193.7m). The decrease since 31 December 2019 is largely due to £87.9m (September 2019: £108.1m and
December 2019: £133.5m) of payments made offset by additions of £44.5m (September 2019: £62.1m and
December 2019: £137.7m).

**Note 12. Dividends**

On 5 March 2020, the Group proposed and paid a cash dividend of £1,150.0m to ASDA Holdings UK Limited, the
immediate parent undertaking. There was no dividend declared or paid in the prior period.

**Note 13. Contingent liabilities**

Equal Value Claims: ASDA Stores Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, has been served with circa
42,000 employment tribunal claims that have been presented on behalf of current and former ASDA store
employees, who allege that their work in ASDA's stores is of equal value in terms of the demands of their jobs to
that of employees working in ASDA's distribution centres, and that the differences in pay and terms and conditions
between the different jobs are not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on
higher wage rates in the distribution centres and those higher wage rates and more favourable terms and conditions
on a prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be served.
At present, the Directors cannot predict the number of claims that may be served, and cannot reasonably estimate
any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Directors believe that there are substantial
factual and legal defences to these claims, and intend to defend the claims vigorously. No provision continues to
be recognised on the basis that any potential liability is only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be confirmed
whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits.

30 September 2020
Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements

**Note 15. Events after the reporting period**

_Proposed change of ownership_

On 2nd October 2020, the ultimate parent company and controlling party of ASDA Group Limited ("ASDA"),
Walmart Inc. ("Walmart"), announced that Mohsin and Zuber Issa, founders and co-CEOs of EG Group, a global
convenience and forecourts retailer, headquartered in Blackburn, UK, and investment funds managed by TDR
Capital LLP ("TDR Capital"), a leading UK-based private equity firm, have together agreed to acquire ASDA for an
enterprise value of £6.8 billion, on a debt-free and cash-free basis. Under the new ownership structure, Mohsin
and Zuber Issa and TDR Capital will own 100% of the ordinary shares in Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited
("BAC3L") which in turn will acquire the entire issued share capital of ASDA from ASDA's current immediate parent
– ASDA Holdings UK Limited ("AHUKL") – and as such, Mohsin and Zuber Issa and TDR Capital will jointly control
ASDA. Walmart will retain a financial interest in the business and an ongoing commercial relationship with ASDA.

_Business rates relief repayment_

In March 2020, as part of a number of measures to support business during the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK
government, the Scottish government and the devolved administrations for Wales and Northern Ireland announced
full relief for rates charges applicable to certain eligible commercial properties for the rates year beginning in April
2020 (and in the case of Northern Ireland, such support ended after July 2020). This relief applied to a number of
properties owned or leased by us and as such, no rates charge has been recognised in these accounts for the
period to which this relief applied.

On 3 December 2020, the group publicly announced that it would voluntarily pay rates for the 2020/21 year on the
properties to which the relief applied, estimated to be £320m - £340m. As rates relief was in place at 30 September
2020, no liability existed at that date and as such, the directors have concluded that the announcement on 3
December 2020 is a non-adjusting post balance sheet event per the guidance set out in IAS 10.

_Post balance sheet distribution_

The Sale & Purchase Agreement ("SPA") agreed between and relating to the sale of the entire issued share capital
of ASDA from AHUKL to BAC3L provides for ASDA being transferred on a cash-free, debt-free basis. As such,
the SPA requires ASDA to distribute surplus cash and intercompany receivables to AHUKL prior to the date on
which ownership of ASDA transfers from AHUKL to BAC3L. On 21 December 2020, in line with the requirements
of the SPA, the Company made distributions of surplus inter-company receivables and cash to AHUKL totalling
£1,769.5m, including an intercompany receivable balance of £1,269.5m owed by AHUKL's immediate parent (WalMart Stores (UK) Limited) and cash of £500.0m.

_Brexit_

On 1 January 2021, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union, there has been no impact on the
interim financial statements set out above.

Annual Report and Consolidated Financial Statements

for the Year Ended 31 December 2019

Reports and Financial Statements
31 December 2019
**Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of ASDA Group Limited**

**Opinion**

We have audited the financial statements of ASDA Group Limited ('the parent company') and its subsidiaries (the
'group') for the year ended 31 December 2019 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated balance sheet, Consolidated statement of changes in equity,
Consolidated statement of cash flows and the related notes 1 to 26, including a summary of significant accounting
policies and the Company balance sheet, Company statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 12,
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in
the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the
preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including FRS 101 "Reduced Disclosure Framework" (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).

In our opinion:

the financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31
December 2019 and of the group's profit for the year then ended;

the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union;

the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance in with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent of the group and parent company in
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK,
including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report
to you where:

the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not
appropriate; or

the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast
significant doubt about the group's or the parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

Reports and Financial Statements
31 December 2019
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of ASDA Group Limited (continued)

**Other information**

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements
and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

the strategic report and directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained
in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or directors' report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report
to you if, in our opinion:

adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or

the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

**Responsibilities of directors**

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 20, the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

### F-15

Reports and Financial Statements
31 December 2019
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of ASDA Group Limited (continued)

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent
company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent
company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
auditor's report.

**Use of our report**

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019**

**1** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

The Company is a private company limited by share capital, incorporated and domiciled in England under the
Companies Act 2006 (registration number 1396513).

The address of its registered office is:
ASDA House
South Bank
Great Wilson Street
Leeds
LS11 5AD
UK

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as "the
Group").

These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board on 25 March 2020.

**Statement of compliance**

The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards and its interpretations adopted by the EU ("adopted IFRSs").

**Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates**

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

**Basis of preparation**

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with adopted IFRSs and under historical cost
accounting rules.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group's accounting
policies.

The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds
(£m) except where otherwise stated.

As described in the Strategic Report, the main activities of the Group are the retailing of food, clothing, general
merchandise products, fuel and services throughout the United Kingdom and online.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

**Going concern**

At the date of approval of the Accounts, the Directors recognise that the UK is experiencing high levels of economic
and social uncertainty surrounding the outbreak and spread of COVID-19. As such, in assessing the Group's ability
to adopt the going concern basis in preparation of the Financial Statements, the Directors have considered the
financial impact that COVID-19 may have on the Group's operating cashflows in the foreseeable future based on
data available at the date of approval. Specifically as part of this assessment, the Directors have tested the ability
of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the 12 months following the date of approval in the event of
various cashflow scenarios, including a severe downside reduction in revenue – based on independent estimates
of the range of forecast impacts on UK GDP – versus expected revenue for the 12 months following the date of
approval. Based on the range of cashflow forecasts modelled, and considering the Group's financial position at the
date of approval of the Accounts along with the Group's access to borrowing facilities via the ultimate parent
company or an alternative lender as required, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparation
of the Financial Statements.

Factors specifically considered which support this conclusion include a balanced assessment of the principal
financial impacts which the Directors expect to impact the Group in the 12 month period following the date of
approval of the Accounts:

Expected net increase in demand for groceries purchased through retail outlets during the period of national
disruption given restrictions in place on customers' ability to purchase food from non-retail outlets such as
restaurants;

The Group's ability to fulfil demand for groceries through a variety of fulfilment channels, including a significant
online presence through ASDA.com;

Impacts on product availability of significant short-term increases in customer demand for certain everyday
essential products;

Incremental costs related to a significant expected increase in colleague absence;

Expected cost savings in the 12 month period following the date of approval of the accounts due primarily to UK
government support announced prior to the date of approval of the accounts to provide financial support to
retailers; and,

The ability of the Group to access significant short-term borrowing facilities via the ultimate parent company or an
alternative lender as required in the event of short-term liquidity issues.

**Changes in accounting policy**

**New standards, interpretations and amendments effective**
The following have been applied for the first time from 1 January 2019.

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

**_IFRS 16 – Leases_**

In the current year, the Group has applied IFRS 16 Leases (as issued by the IASB in January 2016) that is effective
for annual periods that begin on or after 1 January 2019. This replaces IAS 17 'Leases' and IFRIC 4 'Determining
whether an arrangement contains a lease'.

IFRS 16 introduces new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting. It introduces significant
changes to lessee accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance lease and requiring the
recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at commencement for all leases, except for short-term leases
and leases of low value assets when such recognition exemptions are adopted. In contrast to lessee accounting,
the requirements for lessor accounting have remained largely unchanged. The date of initial application of IFRS
16 for the Group is 1 January 2019.

_Impact on lessee accounting_

IFRS 16 changes how the Group accounts for leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17, which
were recorded off-Balance Sheet.

Applying IFRS 16, for all leases (except as noted below), the Group:

a) recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, initially measured
at the present value of the future lease payments, with the right-of-use asset adjusted by the amount of
any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the Balance Sheet immediately
before the date of transition.

b) recognises depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the Consolidated Income
Statement.

Lease incentives (e.g. rent free periods) are recognised as part of the measurement of the right-of-use assets and
lease liabilities whereas under IAS 17 they resulted in the recognition of a lease incentive accrual, amortised as a
reduction of rental expenses on a straight line basis.

Under IFRS 16, right-of-use assets are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36.

For leases that were classified as finance leases before the transition date, the carrying amount of these leases
has been reclassified to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities respectively.

_Impact on lessor accounting_

IFRS 16 does not change substantially how a lessor accounts for leases. Under IFRS 16, a lessor continues to
classify leases as either finance leases or operating leases and account for those two types of leases differently.
Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the classification under IFRS 16 is required to be made with reference
to the right-of-use asset that arises under the headlease. On transition to IFRS 16, there has been no change to
how leases where the Group is a head or intermediate lessor are accounted for.

### F-24

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

_Practical expedients and policy choices_

The Group has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach which:

requires the Group to recognise the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 as an adjustment to the opening
balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application; and,

does not permit restatement of comparatives, which continue to be presented under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4.

IFRS 16 allows for certain transition and accounting policy options for companies taking the modified retrospective
approach. The Group has applied the following practical expedients at transition date, but no others:

To rely on the previous identification of a lease (as provided by IAS 17 or IFRIC 4) for all contracts that existed on
the transition date; and,

To exclude initial direct costs other than those arising from lease buy-outs (see note 11) from the measurement of
the right-of-use asset on the transition date.

With respect to all leases previously classified as operating under IAS 17, the Group has elected to measure rightof-use assets recognised on the transition date at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of
any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the Balance Sheet immediately before
the transition date.

The Group has taken the following ongoing policy choices from the adoption date:

To account for any lease with a term of less than 12 months as a short term lease, recognising cost in the Income
Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term and not recognising a right-of-use asset and lease
liability at the contract date;

To apply the IFRS 16 low value asset exemption threshold based on the value of the asset when new, on an
individual asset basis if deemed appropriate;

To apply a materiality threshold to all leases on and post transition. Costs relating to leases with total undiscounted
cash flows over the life of the lease below a documented threshold will be expensed as incurred and no
right-of-use asset or lease liability will be recognised at the contract date;

To elect to combine lease and non-lease components prospectively after the transition date. This applies to all
leases with the exception of IT and printer leases.

_Financial impact of adoption_

In the year of adoption, the overall impact to the Income Statement was a decrease in profit before tax of £21.3m,
split as a decrease to operating costs of £31.4m and an increase to finance costs of £52.7m.

these balances therefore included in the related lease right-of-use asset.

Total lease liability under IFRS16 at 1 January 2019 2,225.5

_Notes_
1) Discount rate on transition. Liabilities on transition were discounted using a weighted average incremental
borrowing rate ("IBR") of 3.26%. IBR has been determined on a lease-by-lease basis based on a Group
specific borrowing rate with reference to the remaining lease term. IBRs applied range between 0.8% to
15.5%.
2) Lease term. Under IAS 17, future operating lease commitments were disclosed to the contractual end date
only. Under IFRS 16, additional consideration has been given to contractual lease extension options and
extension rights when assessing lease term. Future cash flows are therefore higher under IFRS 16 where
extensions have been included in addition to the contractual term.

**New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective**

There are no issued but not yet effective standards, interpretations and amendments, which have not been applied
in these financial statements, that will or may have an effect on the Group financial statements in future.

**Judgements, estimates and assumptions**

Management are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies
and reported assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually
evaluated and are based on historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future events
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The key estimates and assumptions impacting the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed further
below.

_Supplier Income_

Supplier incentives, rebates, fixed income and discounts are collectively known as "supplier income". Accounting
for the amount and timing of recognition of certain elements of supplier income may require the exercise of
judgement. The three key types of supplier income are explained in the accounting policy below. The areas
requiring a level of judgement and estimation involved are considered below:

### F-27


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

Annual supplier rebates – typically these are earned and billed within the financial year of the Group. A small
proportion of rebate agreements may extend beyond the year-end and in these cases, estimations may be
required of projected sales volumes and judgement may also need to be applied to determine the rebate
level earned if agreements involve multiple tiers. All income accruals are supported by detailed calculations,
based on the explicit terms in each agreement and judgements are minimal, due to the small number of
agreements spanning the year-end.

Fixed amount supplier income – the majority of this income is earned and billed within the financial year of the
Group. A small proportion of agreements may not be coterminous with the year-end and, in these cases,
any income accrued is supported by detailed calculations. These require judgement to determine when the
terms of the agreement are satisfied and that amounts are recognised in the correct period.

Supplier income recognised in the Income Statement and accounted for within trade receivables (note 13) at the
year-end for which estimation and judgement is required is £2.0m (2018: £0.6m). This represents the net amount
of accrued income (£2.0m) (2018: £0.6m) and deferred income (£nil) (2018: £nil) on deals running across the yearend.

_IFRS 16 lease term_

IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the period covered by options
to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option, and the period covered by an option
to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise the option. The Group applies judgement
to whether an extension should be added to the non-cancellable lease term with reference to the following:

Extension options in the contract. Consideration as to whether any option is reasonably certain to be exercised is
based on whether an economic incentive exists to do so. This incentive is assessed by reference to multiple
factors including but not limited to current operational performance of the site and future performance
projections, length of time to the option exercise date and future capital requirements. The majority of the
Group's leases do not have extension options in the contract but, where they do, most lease terms include
the extension period.

Geographical factors. A term extension on any lease for sites in England and Wales may be judged reasonably
certain on the basis of security of tenure if an economic incentive to remain in the lease beyond the
contractual term is deemed to exist. This incentive is assessed by reference to the same factors listed
above. If an extension is judged reasonably certain, the typical additional term applied is 10 years.
Geographical factors are not considered for sites outside England and Wales.

In the event of changing circumstances or new information that may impact judgements taken, lease terms will be
re-assessed on a lease by lease basis. A quarterly review is performed to identify where re-assessments may be
required. Any change in lease term could result in a recalculation of the lease liability and a material adjustment to
the associated right-of-use asset. There are no examples of term reassessment in 2019.

_Other_

The insurance provision (note 18) relates to liabilities arising from past events which are not covered by third party
insurance. This includes both known and potential claims from stores and depots. Estimates are made with regards
to determining the provision required either by actuarial assessment or based on historical experience.

### F-28


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance with
IAS 37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters are
made in contingent liabilities (note 23).

Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be
classified as trade payables or financing. In determining the classification, the Group reviews each arrangement
against a number of characteristics and the legal form of the arrangement is considered. All balances under supply
chain financing arrangements are currently treated as trade payables.

_Share-based payment transactions_

The Group estimates fair value for share-based payment transactions depending on the terms and conditions of
the grants. This estimate also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including
assumptions of the expected life of the share option, share price, volatility and dividend yield. The assumptions
and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 17.

_Pension Buy-in_

Judgement has been applied in accounting for the buy-in of the defined benefit ASDA Group Pension Scheme
("the Scheme") during the year. As the Group retains an obligation to fund pension liabilities of the Scheme in the
event of insurer default, the buy-in does not meet the criteria of a settlement event as set out in IAS 19 – Employee
Benefits. As such, the actuarial loss associated with the buy-in has been recognised in other comprehensive
income. Further detail is provided in note 17.

**Basis of consolidation**

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Income Statement from the
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments
are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by
the Group.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its
subsidiaries, which are related parties, are eliminated in full.

**Business combinations and goodwill**

Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition
date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of noncontrolling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets is
determined on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in
operating costs. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for
appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

### F-29


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the
consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable
amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination. Identifiable
intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from
goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can
be measured reliably.

If the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for
the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair
value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference is measured in profit and loss.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of
the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other
assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit, or group of units, to which goodwill is
allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the
goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when
determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured
based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

**Foreign currency**

The presentational currency of the Group is Sterling. The primary functional currency of the parent and subsidiary
companies is also Sterling.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the Balance Sheet date are translated at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences are recognised in the Income Statement,
except when hedge accounting is applied and differences are recognised in the Statement of Other Comprehensive
Income.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the spot rate ruling at the Balance Sheet date. The
income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate
approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.

Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive
income. They are released into the Income Statement upon disposal.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired are carried initially at cost. Following initial recognition, the historic cost model is applied,
with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

**Amortisation**

Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their
expected useful lives, with charges included in operating costs, as follows:

Software and development costs 4 to 8 years
Lease buy out costs* over the lease term
Other intangibles 3 years

The purchased goodwill of the Group and brand licence intangibles are regarded as having an indefinite useful
economic life and in accordance with IAS 38, are not amortised but are subject to annual tests for impairment.

*As described in note 11, on 1 January 2019 following adoption of IFRS 16 – Leases, lease buy-out assets are
now classified as right-of-use assets and are amortised over the lease term.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004, the
date of transition to IFRSs, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of
that revaluation.

Items of property, plant and equipment under construction are valued at cost and not depreciated. Depreciation is
charged from the date that the assets are available for use.

Assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to lower of fair value and the present
value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses. Following the adoption of IFRS 16 'Leases' at 1 January 2019, these amounts are classified as right-of-use
assets (see note 10 for details).

All property, plant and equipment is reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets'.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is
included in the Income Statement.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

**Depreciation**

Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Freehold properties 20 – 50 years
Finance leases and leasehold improvements Shorter of 20 – 50 years or the lease term
Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings 3 – 20 years

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets are reviewed at each Balance Sheet date to determine
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is
estimated.

An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent
from those of other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time-value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment
losses on continuing operations are recognised in the Income Statement in those expense categories consistent
with the function of the impaired asset.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units ("CGU") are allocated first to reduce the carrying
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and second, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the
unit on a pro-rata basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

**Assets held for sale**

The Group classifies non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally
through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Non-current assets classified as held for sale are
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.

The criteria for held for sale classification is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Actions required to complete the sale should indicate that it
is unlikely that significant changes to the sale will be made or that the decision to sell will be withdrawn.
Management must be committed to the plan to sell the asset and the sale expected to be completed within one
year from the date of the classification.

Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised once classified as held for
sale. Assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented separately as current items in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

**Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the Balance Sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation,
and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect is material, provisions are
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time-value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

**Leases**

**_The Group as a lessee_**

The Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease at inception of the contract. The Group recognises
a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the
lessee, except for short-term leases (defined as leases with a lease term of 12 months or less) and leases of low
value assets (defined as leases where the cost of the underlying asset is below an internally set materiality
threshold). For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line
basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which
economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed.

_Lease liability_

The lease liability is initially measured at the value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement
date, discounted to present value.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:

Fixed lease payments (including in-substance fixed payments), less any lease incentives receivable;

Variable lease payments that depend on an index or rate, initially measured using the index or rate at the
commencement date;

The amount expected to be payable by the lessee under residual value guarantees;

The exercise price of purchase options, if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; and,

Payments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the
lease.

The lease liability is presented as separate current and non-current lines in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease
liability (using the effective interest rate method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments
made.

### F-33


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

The Group re-measures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset)
whenever:

The lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in the
assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is re-measured by discounting
the revised lease payments using the current discount rate;

The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a
guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease
payments using an unchanged discount rate; or,

A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the
lease liability is re-measured based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised lease
payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.

_Discount rate_

When discounting payments to present value, the Group uses the interest rate implicit in the lease if this rate can
be readily determined. For a small volume of high value leases, the rate implicit in the lease can be calculated and
has therefore been used.

Otherwise, for the majority of leases the rate used is based on an estimated incremental borrowing rate. Rates are
determined with reference to UK rates available to the Group adjusted for lease term. Rates are updated on a
quarterly basis.

_Right-of-use Assets_

Right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at
or before the commencement day (including lease buy out payments made to previous tenants) less any lease
incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses.

Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or
the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-ofuse asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. Depreciation is charged from the
commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet.

The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified
impairment loss as described in the 'Impairment' policy above.

_Non-lease components and variable rent expense_

As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account
for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has taken this election
with

### F-34


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

the exception of IT and printer leases where other charges included in the contract (maintenance and
replenishment) are accounted for separately within related cost lines.

The primary non-lease components recognised within lease payments are property costs (service charges and
insurances) paid to landlords and included within the terms of lease contracts. These costs are included within the
lease payments at commencement date if fixed, or within variable rent expense as incurred if not. The majority of
these payments are variable and therefore not included in the lease liability.

As a lessee, the Group does not have any rent payment terms linked to sales or other variable metrics.

**_The Group as a lessor_**

The Group enters into lease agreements as a lessor with respect to a small amount of its excess property and
space inside operational stores. Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating
leases. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee,
the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases.

Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the head lease and sub-lease are accounted for as two separate
contracts and assessment of classification is made with reference to the right-of-use asset resulting from the head
lease rather than the underlying asset. The Group currently has no leases classified as finance where it is the
lessor.

Where the Group owns the freehold, assets are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over
their useful economic lives. Rental income from operating leases, including the effect of lease incentives, is
recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

Third party lessees are subject to credit checks prior to entering into a lease contract with the Group and may be
required to provide a guarantor depending on the outcome of these checks. Additionally, some leases contain
clauses enabling upwards revision of the rental charge according to prevailing market condition at points within the
lease contracts.

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.

_Financial assets and liabilities_

The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities in the following categories: trade and other receivables,
intercompany receivables, derivatives designated as hedges, cash and cash equivalents, interest-bearing loans
and receivables and trade, other and intercompany payables. The Group's accounting policies relating to lease
liabilities are described above.

Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition.

### F-35


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

All financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. The Group assesses financial assets for
impairment using the expected credit losses model and recognises impairment losses as required.

_Loans and receivables_

The Group's loans and receivables, including amounts owed by fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate parent company,
are held with the sole objective of collecting contractual cash flows and are therefore carried at amortised cost.
They are included in current assets except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet
date.

_Interest-bearing loans and borrowings_

Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction
costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or
losses arising on repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income
or finance cost.

_Offsetting of financial instruments_

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet only when there is a
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

_Fair values_

Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm'slength transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted
cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

_Derivative financial instruments and hedging_

Derivative financial instruments ("derivatives") are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations.

Derivatives are stated at their fair value. The fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts is their market value
at the Balance Sheet date. Market values are calculated using mathematical models and are based on the duration
of derivative together with quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market volatility
at the Balance Sheet date.

For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship is
formally designated and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured
throughout its duration.

### F-36


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

All of the Group's hedges are considered to be cash flow hedges, hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that
are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast
transaction.

For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly as
other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion would be recognised in profit and loss. Amounts
recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Income Statement, within cost of inventories
recognised as an expense, when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast purchase
occurs.

If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income are transferred to profit and loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised
without replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs and are
transferred to the Income Statement, within cost of inventories recognised as an expense.

The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast
transactions and firm commitments. Refer to note 16 for further details.

**Inventories**

Inventories comprise goods for resale and goods not for resale and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value.

Goods at warehouses are valued at weighted average cost. Expenditure incurred in acquiring the goods and
bringing them to their existing location and condition (including applicable supplier income) are included in
inventories. Inventories at retail outlets are valued at average cost prices. Goods not for resale primarily comprise
fuel and are valued on a first in, first out basis.

**Taxation**

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Income Statement,
except that a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is
also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted
or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes except:

the initial recognition of goodwill or of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than
in a business combination;

### F-37


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will
not reverse in the foreseeable future; and,

deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised.

The amount of deferred tax provided is measured on an undiscounted basis based on the expected manner of
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the Balance Sheet date.

**Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are stated at their original invoiced value (discounted if material) as reduced by
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are
assessed as uncollectible.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three
months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand, to the extent that they are used, are included as a
component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

**Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables, other than intercompany loans, are non-interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal
value.

**Borrowing costs**

Borrowing costs are recognised in the Group's Income Statement except for costs that are directly attributable to
the construction of buildings which are capitalised and included within the initial cost of a building. Capitalisation of
borrowing costs ceases when the property is ready for use. The interest rate applied is based on the average rate
of general borrowings outstanding during a period.

**Defined contribution pension plans**

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an operating expense in the
Income Statement as incurred.

**Defined benefit pension assets and liabilities**

The Group's net asset or liability in respect of its defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the
amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in prior periods; that benefit is

### F-38


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The calculation is
performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The financing costs of the scheme are
recognised in the period in which they arise.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income in the period in
which they occur.

In the prior year, the Group was subject to minimum funding requirements in the UK and did not have an
unconditional right to a refund of a surplus. This resulted in an obligation which was recognised as an additional
liability and a reduction to other comprehensive income. As described in note 17, a buy-in of the ASDA Group
Pension Scheme ("the Scheme") was executed during the year. Other than estimated contributions in respect of
the buy-in loan described below, the probability of the Group having to make further contributions to the Scheme
in the future in respect of pension liabilities is deemed to be remote. As such, the liability relating to the minimum
funding obligation has been released in full with a corresponding gain being recognised in other comprehensive
income.

**Dividend distributions**

Dividend distributions to the Company's shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group's financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's shareholders.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue represents sales to customers through retail outlets and online, excluding value added tax. Revenue is
recognised net of intercompany transactions, staff discounts, coupons and the free element of multi-save
transactions.

_Income from concessions and commissions_

Income from concessions and commissions is based on the terms of the contract and is included within rental
income and other income.

_Interest and dividend income_

Interest income is recognised in the Income Statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Dividend income is recognised in the Company's profit on the date the Company's right to receive payments is
established.

**Supplier income**

Supplier incentives, rebates, fixed income and discounts (collectively known as "supplier income") are recognised,
as a deduction from cost of inventories recognised as an expense, as they accrue in accordance with the terms of
each relevant supplier agreement. All supplier income is supported by agreements and, in the majority of instances,
these agreements begin and end within the Group's financial year. In a small number of instances,

### F-39


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

contractual periods may extend over the Group's year end. In such cases the amount of any income accrued in
relation to these agreements is supported by detailed calculations.

Supplier income is split into three classifications:

Supplier incentives and discounts – which are usually expressed in the supplier agreement as an agreed amount
per item sold. This type of supplier income is mechanically calculated and therefore no judgement is required
in determining the amount of income to record in the financial year;

Annual supplier rebates – these are earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases.
The rebates are linked to pre-agreed volumes of sales or purchases of specific products and are supported
by explicit contractual terms; and,

Fixed amount supplier income – this is earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases.
Fixed monetary amounts are agreed with suppliers relating to certain promotional activities including, for
example, new product listings, increased product distribution or specific promotional events.

Unbilled amounts of income to which the Group is contractually entitled are included in trade and other receivables,
or offset against corresponding trade payables, however these amounts are not considered material. Billed
amounts unpaid at year-end are included in trade receivables or offset against corresponding trade payables where
a contractual right of offset exists.

**Share-based payments**

For all liabilities arising from share-based payment arrangements the Group has applied IFRS 2 'Share-Based
Payments'.

The share option programmes allow Group employees to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company; these
awards are granted by the Group. The fair value of options granted is initially measured at grant date and spread
over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The charge is recognised
as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value of the share option is measured
based on an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were
granted. The liability is remeasured at each Balance Sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair
value are recognised in the Income Statement during the vesting period. These share based payment transactions
are accounted for as cash-settled.

**Contingent liabilities**

The Group may, from time to time, be subject to legal proceedings. Where a liability is not probable or the amount
cannot be reasonably estimated a liability is not recognised. However, where a loss is not considered probable but
a liability is possible and may be material, such matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

**Policies applicable prior to 1 January 2019**

The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement
at inception date and whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or
assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.

_Group as a lessee_

Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are
classified as finance leases. Other leases are classified as operating leases.

Where land and buildings are held under leases the determination of the land is considered separately from that
of the buildings.

_Finance leases_

Assets acquired by way of a finance lease are recognised at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value and the
present value, calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease, of the minimum lease payments at inception
of the lease with a corresponding liability as an obligation to pay future rentals. Lease payments are apportioned
between the finance charge and the outstanding obligation so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability. Assets are depreciated over the term of the lease.

_Operating leases_

Rental payments are expensed to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Leases that
contain predetermined fixed rental increases are accounted for such that the increases are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives received are recognised in the Income Statement over the
lease term.

Prepaid operating lease rentals are recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

_Group as a lessor_

Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their
useful economic lives. Rental income, including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight-line basis
over the lease term.

**2** **Segment reporting**

The Group is engaged in a single reportable operating segment of business, being the retailing of food, clothing,
general merchandise, fuel and services in a single geographical segment, the United Kingdom and online. The
Group is not reliant on any individual major customers.

### F-41

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

In line with the Group's reporting framework and management structure, key operating decisions are made by the
Executive Board which is considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Group. All significant
revenue is generated by the sale of goods through retail outlets in the UK and through the Group's online channels.
The operations of all product areas of the business are subject to similar economic characteristics and are sold in
a similar retail environment.

The Group has taken these factors into account together with the core principles of IFRS 8 in determining that it
has a single reportable operating segment.

The analysis of the Group's revenue for the year from continuing operations is as follows:

Total tax charge 69.6 94.5

The standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom for the year is 19% (2018: 19%). On 15 September
2016, the Finance Act 2016 received Royal Assent and enacted a reduction in the main rate of corporation tax to
17% with effect from 1 April 2020. Deferred tax has been provided at the rate at which the Group estimated the
temporary differences would reverse, based on rates substantively enacted and enacted at the balance sheet date.
On the 11 March 2020, it was announced in the UK Budget that the reduction in the corporation tax rate to 17% on
1 April 2020 would be reversed, and the standard rate of corporation tax in the United Kingdom will remain at 19%.
The impact of providing for deferred tax at a rate of 19% would be an increase in deferred tax assets of the Group
totalling £2.4m. This has not been recognised in the year ended 31 December 2019 as the change was not
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Certain properties have been revalued to their fair value prior to 1 January 2004. The tax base of certain land and
buildings has also been adjusted to include within it any rolled-over gains which might subsequently become
chargeable on a future sale of relevant properties. Where it has been calculated that indexation allowance exists
to reduce the temporary difference on these assets, no deferred tax liability is recognised to the extent that
indexation allowance is available.
The Group has unrecognised brought forward capital losses of £332.8m (2018: £336.0m) available to reduce future
capital gains. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these capital losses due to uncertainty of
when they may be utilised.

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

**Reclassifications**

During the year, £9.6m of assets were reclassified to assets held for sale within current assets (2018: £nil). Assets
held for sale consist of one non-operational fulfilment centre. Following a management decision to sell, a third party
has been contracted to actively market the site in its current condition. Active marketing commenced in December
2019 and the site is currently expected to be sold in 2020. The value reclassified represents advertised sale price
less expected costs to sell.

During the prior year, assets relating to lease buy-outs were reclassified from leasehold improvements to intangible
assets to better reflect the nature of these items. Assets transferred had a gross cost of £3.6m and accumulated
depreciation of £1.0m (see note 11).

**Impairment**

Both the operational and non-operational estate are regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment. Following
reviews in the year, impairment charges of £60.1m (2018: £1.7m) were recognised in operating costs during the
year.

Impairment charges primarily relate to three fulfilment centres. Following a strategic review of the estate, which
included a detailed assessment by the Directors of the financial performance of individual sites in the property
estate, updates were made to forecasts of future site by site profitability and consequently, the value in use of these
three sites was determined to be lower than both book value and fair value. Carrying value at 31 December 2019
for the three sites impaired during the year represents fair value less expected costs to sell.

**Capitalised interest**

The cumulative amount of capitalised interest included in the cost of fixed assets is £273.0m (2018: £273.0m).

**Finance leases**

Properties held under finance leases in the prior year had the following net book values at 31 December 2018. As
described above, these assets were reclassified to right-of-use assets on 1 January 2019 following transition to
IFRS 16 – Leases.

On transition to IFRS 16 – Leases at 1 January 2019, assets with a cost of £254.9m and accumulated depreciation
of £40.0m were reclassified from property, plant and equipment (see note 9). Additionally, at this date assets
relating to lease buy-outs with a cost of £151.5m and accumulated amortisation of £50.2m were reclassified from
intangible assets (see note 11).
The Group leases various offices, stores, warehouses, vehicles and equipment under agreements within the scope
of IFRS 16.
Leases of land and buildings have various terms, escalation clauses and renewal rights, however they commonly
include either a market rent review or index linked rent review with a cap and collar. The timing of when rent reviews
take place differs for each lease. They have no purchase options. The average remaining lease term is 34 years.
One property right-of-use asset was impaired in the year.
Leases of plant, vehicles and equipment have various terms but typically do not include mid-term rent reviews or
extension options. They have no purchase options. The average remaining lease term is 3 years.
Additions in the year primarily relate to renewals or modifications of previously existing leases.
For further details of lease liabilities please see note 21.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

**Reclassifications**

During the prior year, assets relating to lease buy-outs that were reclassified from finance lease and leasehold
improvements to intangible assets to better reflect the nature of these items, had a gross cost of £3.6m and
accumulated depreciation of £1.0m (see note 9).

**Impairment testing of goodwill**

**_Netto Acquisition_**

Goodwill of £482.3m (2018: £482.3m) arose on the acquisition of Netto Foodstores Limited on 13 April 2011. This
has been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2019 by allocating costs directly attributable to Netto stores
and a reasonable allocation of central costs, to the chain of converted Netto stores along with other related assets.
This represents the lowest level to which management monitors goodwill.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from
financial budgets approved by senior management covering a five-year period. This is the period to which specific
reliable forecasts have been made. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8.4% and the
growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the specific forecast period is 0.6%.

The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the assumptions of sales growth, gross margin, operating costs,
growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial forecast period, and the discount rate.

**Sales growth – sales expectations are initially formed based on management expectations of growth of small-**
format stores for the foreseeable future. This takes into account historic data and current performance as well as
future market expectations from internal and external sources.

**Gross profit –** Margin assumptions are formed based on management expectations of realistic future margin
forecasts. These expectations are based on historic and current performance combined with internal and external
factors expected to affect gross profit margin in future years.

**Operating costs – some costs are directly attributable to individual stores. Other costs derive from central or**
shared costs for the whole Group and must be allocated to the chain on a reasonable basis. Operating cost
forecasts for the Netto chain reflect a combination of experience since acquisition and existing similar stores from
2011 to 2019 extrapolated as a proportion of sales, and known impacts to costs in future years.

**Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial forecast period –** long-term growth rate
forecasts are based on a combination of long-term economic GDP growth forecasts for the UK and internal
management growth expectations.

**Discount rate – the pre-tax discount rate used in calculating the value in use represents an assessment of the**
rate of return a market participant would expect for an equally risky investment. This has been calculated by
estimating the weighted average cost of capital of the Group.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

With regard to the assessment of value in use, based upon calculations performed, management believe that no
reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the chain of
Netto stores to exceed its recoverable amount.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

**_Turkmen Tedarik Hizmetleri Acquisition_**

Goodwill of £17.0m (2018: £17.0m) arose on the acquisition of Turkmen Tedarik Hizmetleri on 26 April 2012. This
has been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2019 by assessing the present value of forecasted cash savings
arising from the synergies achieved as a result of the acquisition. Goodwill is allocated to a single cash-generating
unit, being the acquired sourcing company.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cashflow projections from financial
budgets approved by senior management covering a five-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the
cashflow projections is 8.4% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the cashflows beyond specific forecast period
is 0.0%.

The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the assumptions of growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows
beyond the initial forecast period and the discount rate.

**Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial forecast period – long-term growth rate**
forecasts are based on long-term economic GDP growth forecasts for the UK, management expectation of category
sales growth and management forecasts of the geographical split of purchases.

**Discount rate – the pre-tax discount rate used in calculating the value in use represents an assessment of the**
rate of return a market participant would expect for an equally risky investment. This has been calculated by
estimating the weighted average costs of capital of other likely acquirers as well as that of the Group.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

With regard to the assessment of value in use, based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis
undertaken, management believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would
cause the carrying value of the Turkmen goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

**Impairment testing of indefinite life intangibles**

**_George brand licence_**

This asset relates to the acquisition in 2006 of a perpetual licence to use the George brand and has a carrying
value of £17.3m (2018: £17.3m). This has been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2019 by assessing the
present value of forecasted cash flows arising from the George clothing business.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from
financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied
to the cash flow projections is 8.4% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond specific forecast
period is 0.3%.

Based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis undertaken, management believe that no reasonably
possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be lower than the
carrying value of the George brand.

Trade receivables are non-interest-bearing and are generally on 30 day terms. Trade receivable balances have
been assessed to determine the value of expected credit losses ("ECLs") using the simplified approach in IFRS 9.
Trade receivables are presented net where a legally enforceable right of set off exists. Included in the above is an
offset of £193.6m (note 15) (2018: £108.8m). The gross trade receivable prior to the offset is £277.9m (2018:
£242.3m).
Other receivables are non-interest-bearing and are generally on 60 day terms. Other receivable balances have
been assessed to determine the value of ECLs as per the requirements of IFRS 9 and the impact is £nil.
The Group considers its trade and other receivables in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due.
However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a trade or other receivable to be in default when internal
or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full
before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A trade or other receivable is written off to
the Income Statement when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.
As at 31 December 2019, trade receivables at nominal value of £4.1m (2018: £3.9m) were impaired and fully
provided for. Movements in the allowance for expected credit losses in the year were as follows:

The Group deals with over ten thousand separate suppliers and has established trading terms which are
appropriate to the particular relationship and product supplied. Whenever an order is placed the parties will be
aware of the payment terms and it is the Group's policy to abide by these terms when satisfactory invoices have
been received.

Trade receivables are presented net where a legally enforceable right of offset exists. Included in the above is an
offset of £193.6m (note 13) (2018: £108.8m). The gross trade payable prior to the offset is £2,753.6m (2018:
£2,970.7m).

**_Non-current interest-bearing borrowings_**
Lease liabilities 2,077.0 230.4

**Total financial liabilities** 8,398.2 6,680.9

As at 31 December 2019 and 31 December 2018, all borrowings were in Sterling at fixed rates of interest. The
interest rate of fixed rate debt is 0.8% – 15.5% (2018: 5.448% – 6.0%), this comprises intercompany payables and
lease liabilities.
Intercompany payables are disclosed in note 24. Details of obligations under leases are included in note 21. The
increase in lease liabilities in the year of £1,947.6m is due to the transition to IFRS 16 as at 1 January 2019.
**_Movements in financial liabilities during the year_**
Lease Liabilities: The net increase in lease liabilities of £1,947.6m during the year is largely attributable to the noncash transition impact of adopting of IFRS 16 – Leases on 1 January 2019 of £1,979.4m (see table in note 1); noncash interest charged on lease liabilities of £66.9m (see note 7) partially offset by cash outflows of £182.5m

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

(£133.5m of capital payments and £49.0m of interest payments). The non-cash impact of recognising liabilities
relating to new leases entered into during the year accounts for the remaining increase.

Intercompany Payables: The net increase in intercompany payables of £135.7m is attributable to interest charged
on intercompany payables during the year of £179.1m (see note 24 for details) partially offset by payments made
during the year of £43.4m, including interest paid of £31.4m.

**_Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities_**

The Group's principal financial instruments during the year comprised cash, cash equivalents, intercompany
payables and receivables, derivatives classified as hedges and lease liabilities. Other financial assets and liabilities,
such as trade receivables, other receivables, trade payables, other payables, and accruals arise directly from the
Group's operating activities. The difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the Group's financial
instruments is not material.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial
instruments:

_Fixed rate borrowings – the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted_
cash flow using appropriate interest rates to net present value.

_Derivatives – derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of forward contracts_
entered into and are split between in the money (assets) and out of the money (liabilities). At 31 December 2019
the Group held £3.1m (2018: £41.0m) in the money assets, and £19.1m (2018: £0.6m) out of the money liabilities
in respect of its forward contracts. During the year, the Group recognised liabilities on revaluation of hedged
monetary assets and liabilities from historical cost to year-end spot rate of £5.4m (2018: £7.4m asset).

The fair values of the Group's financial derivatives and fixed rate borrowings with fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate
parent company have been calculated at observable unquoted interest rates, and are categorised as Level 2 within
the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement'. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than
quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

_Financial risk management_

The Treasury function manages the Group's financial risk, considering its borrowings and exposure to foreign
currency fluctuations. The Group finances its operations through intercompany borrowings which were issued a
number of years ago and are wholly held within the Walmart Inc. group. The Group utilises its cash balances, and
has access to bank overdrafts, to satisfy short-term cash flow requirements. Foreign currency exposure is managed
through entering into forward currency contracts.

_Interest rate risk_

The Group's short-term borrowings are all held with entities which are part of the Walmart Inc. group and are at
fixed rates of interest. Amounts owed to fellow subsidiaries (note 24) attract interest at a rate of 5.448% – 6%
(2018: 5.448 – 6%). As interest rates are fixed on all of the Group's debt, interest rate movements would not have
an impact on profitability, cash flow or equity.

### F-58

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

The Group does not expect to take out borrowings with a variable interest rate in the foreseeable future.

_Foreign currency risk_

The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be
affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are
managed through the use of forward contracts.

The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31 December
2019, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward currency
contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases. The terms of the forward
currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a
period of more than 12 months after the 31 December 2019. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income
are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.

The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31
December 2019, a net unrealised loss of £11.8m (2018: £29.6m gain) was included in the hedge reserve in respect
of hedging contracts. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of these
hedging contracts was £41.4m (2018: £50.6m gain). This consists of £38.0m of gains reclassified to the Income
Statement during the year (2018: £24.2m of losses), a £12.9m loss on not-yet-matured contracts during the year
(2018: £38.3m gain), and a £9.5m taxation credit (2018: £11.9m charge).

Under the Group's hedging policy, the only items for which forward currency contracts are in place are forecast
purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 95% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses attributable
to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the Income Statement
upon maturity of the forward contract. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash flows
would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the year (2018:
none), therefore amounts recognised in the Income Statement in relation to ineffective hedges is £nil (2018: £nil).

As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure through the use of forward currency contracts,
changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short-term profitability or cash flow. It
is anticipated that a 5% movement in the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management's
assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of
£29.7m (2018: £36.6m).

_Credit risk_

There is no significant credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is
included in their carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date. See note 13 for further information on trade
receivables and details of recoverability.

The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default in relation to trade receivables including
detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted. Historically, these procedures have proved
effective in minimising the level of impaired and past due receivables.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**
Surplus cash is placed on short-term deposit with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Group
Treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit. Deposit limits
and approved financial institutions are dictated by the investment policy of the ultimate parent company.
Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses model under IFRS 9 and
no impairment is required.
_Liquidity risk_
The Group's Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring rolling
forecasts of the Group's cash flows. The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding
and flexibility through the use of operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At 31 December 2019 the Group
had no external borrowings, other than lease liabilities.
As at 31 December 2019, the Group held cash of £1,929.3m (2018: £2,916.1m), utilised along with overdrafts
where necessary, to secure short-term flexibility. At 31 December 2019, the Group had committed overdraft
facilities of £30.0m (2018: £30.0m), standby credit facilities, including bonds of £96.7m (2018: £112.1m), and
committed line of credit facilities of £30.0m (2018: £125.0m). The Group also has access to a facility which is
available to other subsidiaries of the ultimate parent, the limit of which depends on the usage by fellow subsidiaries.
The following table summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on contractual
undiscounted payments. The disclosed financial derivative instruments are the gross undiscounted cash flows.

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

**Defined benefit pension schemes**

Historically, the Group has provided retirement benefits for eligible employees through two defined benefit plans in
the UK – one funded, the ASDA Group Pension Scheme ("AGPS" or "the Scheme") and one unfunded, the
Unapproved Unfunded Retirement Benefit Scheme ("UURBS").

The AGPS was subject to a buy-in transaction ("the buy-in") on 17 October 2019 through the purchase of a bulk
purchase annuity ("BPA") policy with the insurer Rothesay Life PLC, under which the benefits payable to all AGPS
pensioners and deferred members have become fully insured.

In order to enable the AGPS to execute the buy-in, the Group made a contribution to the AGPS of £707.5m and
advanced a loan to the scheme with a book value of £467.3m ("the buy-in loan"). Interest is charged at an armslength rate on this loan.

A pre-tax loss of £1,175.8m has been recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the buy-in
representing the difference between the cost of the BPA and the accounting value of the liabilities insured.

Prior to the buy-in, the Group was obliged to fund the deficit on the AGPS on a secondary funding objective basis
by April 2032 under a schedule of contributions for which the Group was liable. A liability was recognised in previous
years in relation to this obligation, known as a minimum funding requirement ("MFR"), under guidance set out in
IFRIC 14. Other than additional contributions under a back-to-back agreement with the Scheme which are
described below, following the buy-in, the probability of the Group being required to make future contributions to
the AGPS in respect of pension liabilities is considered remote and as such the MFR liability has been released in
full during the year, with a corresponding pre-tax gain of £1,051.9m being recognised in other comprehensive
income.

The Scheme has repaid £39.5m of the pre buy-in loan during the year and as such, the outstanding balance on
the buy-in loan at 31 December 2019 was £427.8m. The Scheme has retained ownership of various assets,
including illiquid investments and cash, some of which will be required to meet ongoing expenses incurred by the
Scheme and the remainder of which the Scheme intends to liquidate to repay the buy-in loan. To the extent that
the Scheme is unable to settle the loan balance in full out of the proceeds realised through the liquidation of these
assets, the Group is contractually obliged under a back-to-back agreement to make a contribution to the Scheme
to the value of the shortfall between the assets in the Scheme and the outstanding balance on the buy-in loan.
Based on the fair value of Scheme assets at 31 December 2019, and a forecast of the ongoing expenses to be
incurred by the Scheme, total expected contributions under the back-to-back agreement are expected to be
£119.6m and this amount has been included in operating cashflow in addition to the initial contribution of £707.5m
– a total of £827.1m. As the illiquid assets and cash are held within the Scheme as a separate legal entity from the
Group, and could be used to settle pension liabilities in the event of a shortfall from the BPA, they meet the definition
of pension assets under IAS 19 – Employee Benefits. As such, the difference between fair value of Scheme assets
at 31 December 2019 and the book value of the buy-in loan at that date has been accounted for as an actuarial
loss in other comprehensive income and is included in the buy-in loss amount of £1,175.8m. The Group remains
liable for pension benefits payable to members of the UURBS and these liabilities with a fair value at 31 December
2019 of £14.0m (2018: £11.0m) are accounted for in line with IAS 19. This amount is included in the Scheme
liabilities set out in the table below.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**
**Sensitivity analysis**
The assumptions on the discount rate, inflation, and life expectancy all have a significant effect on the measurement
of the present value of the scheme liabilities. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the IAS
19 pension liability at 31 December 2019 and of the Income Statement charge for 2018, to changes in these
assumptions.
A sensitivity analysis for the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities is set out below:

**Year ended 31** **Year ended 31**
**December** **December**
**2019** **2018**
**+ 0.1%** **+ 0.1%**

**Adjustment to discount rate** **£ m** **£ m**

Decrease in liability 56.4 44.3

Decrease in finance costs 0.2 1.6


**Year ended 31** **Year ended 31**
**December** **December**
**2019** **2018**
**+ 0.1%** **+ 0.1%**

**Adjustment to rate of inflation** **£ m** **£ m**

Increase in liability 13.1 43.9

Increase in finance costs - 1.3


**Year ended 31** **Year ended 31**
**December** **December**
**2019** **2018**
**+ 0.1%** **+ 0.1%**

**Adjustment to mortality age rating assumption** **£ m** **£ m**

Increase in liability 92.5 70.7

Increase in finance costs - 2.1

Following execution of the buy-in, changes in the accounting value of liabilities are offset by equivalent changes in
the BPA asset and therefore, there would be no material impact on the net amount recognised in the Consolidated
Balance Sheet, within the Consolidated Income Statement, or within the Consolidated Statement of
Comprehensive Income.
The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When
calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in actuarial assumptions the same method
(present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the
reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the Balance Sheet.
These sensitivities exclude the impact of the onerous liability recorded in the prior year, which has been released
in full during the year as described earlier in this note.
The methods and changes in assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis are the same as those used
in the previous period.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**

**Share-based payments**

Share-based payment transactions are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 'Share-Based Payments'.

The Group offers four share-based payment schemes to employees to enable them to own shares in the ultimate
parent company, Walmart Inc. The Group has the obligation to settle the liabilities for the schemes, including
employment taxes for participating employees, and therefore these schemes are accounted for as cash-settled
liabilities.

The impact is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of Walmart Inc. and the share options would not
be revalued during the vesting period if the Group were granting options on its own shares in a way consistent with
UK public limited companies. Two of these schemes involve the granting of options to employees to acquire shares
in the ultimate parent company at pre-determined exercise prices and two of the schemes involve the granting of
rights to receive shares in the ultimate parent company for nil consideration. The Performance Share Plan ("PSP")
has performance conditions relating to the total pay out of options issued. No other scheme has any performance
conditions attached to the scheme.

The total expenses recognised for the year arising from share-based payments and the associated amounts
recognised in the Balance Sheet are as follows:


**Year ended 31**
**December**
**2019**
**£ m**


**Year ended 31**

Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year. The average exercise price during the year
to 31 December 2019 was £37.23 (2018: £43.72). The related shares are denominated in US Dollars, being the
reporting currency of the ultimate parent company. The sterling exercise price of the Sharesave scheme options is
fixed at the exchange rate on date of grant.
_Sharesave scheme_
The scheme has been in existence for employees since 1982 and gained HMRC approval in 2000. Employees
with six months' service are invited to join the scheme annually. Options are granted annually to employees who
elect to join, and are exercisable in three or five years from date of grant, depending on the year of grant. Currently
only three year grants are being offered. The options under this scheme are treated as cash-settled. The exercise
price of the options granted is equal to the market price of the shares less 20% on the date of grant.

The fair value of the options outstanding under the WSIP scheme at 31 December 2019 is £0.2m (2018: £0.4m).
_Restricted Stock Rights (RSR) scheme_
The RSR scheme was introduced in 2008 as an alternative to the WSIP scheme. Under the RSR scheme,
employees are awarded the right to receive a predetermined number of shares in the ultimate parent company two
or three years from the award date. All RSRs are classed as unapproved from an Income Tax and National
Insurance perspective. RSR awards are treated as cash-settled.
The number of share awards under the RSR scheme is as follows:

The fair value of the options outstanding under the RSR scheme at 31 December 2019 is £30.8m (2018: £22.4m).
_Performance Share Plan (PSP) scheme_
The Group offers a PSP scheme, for which conditions exist in relation to exercise as described below.
The scheme came into existence on 20 July 2006. Under the scheme, selected executives are granted the right to
receive shares in Walmart Inc. provided certain pre-determined performance goals are met. These pre-determined
goals are in respect of sales growth and return on investment. All share awards under the PSP scheme have been
issued for nil consideration and have a contractual life of between 1 and 3 years. The share awards under this
scheme are treated as cash-settled.
The number of share awards under the PSP scheme is as follows:

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued)**
The fair value of the options outstanding under the PSP scheme at 31 December 2019 is £8.3m (2018: £12.0m).
The fair value of share options is measured using a Black-Scholes model taking into account the terms and
conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The following table gives the weighted average assumptions applied to the options granted during the year and
are outstanding in the respective periods shown.

**Year ended 31** **Year ended 31**
**December** **December**
**2019** **2018**

Expected dividend yield (%) 1.78 2.22
Expected volatility (%) 15.79 22.44
Risk-free interest rate (%) 1.59 2.63
Weighted average fair value of options granted (£) 19.77 13.67

Weighted average exercise price (£) 53.26 45.27

The expected life of the option in the year was 1 to 3 years (2018: 1 to 3 years).
Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price is expected to fluctuate during the year. The Group has used
historical volatilities that correlate with the expected term of the options.
Share options are exercisable in US Dollars and the risk-free interest rate is based on the applicable US Treasury
rate.

The insurance provision above relates to claims liabilities arising from past events such as accidents in our depots
and stores which are not covered by third party insurance. The value of the provision is established using
independent actuarial assessments or a reasonable estimate based on past experience. These provisions are
expected to crystallise within 5 years.
The dilapidation provision represents provisions for the cost of works required to remove leasehold improvements
within leasehold properties at the end of their lease term. The amount provided during the year is accounted for
within additions as an increase in the cost of property, plant and equipment and the impact of this will be recognised
as additional depreciation over the lease terms of the sites to which the provision relates.

Equal Value Claims: ASDA Stores Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, has been served with circa
38,000 employment tribunal claims that have been presented on behalf of current and former ASDA store
employees, who allege that their work in ASDA's stores is of equal value in terms of the demands of their jobs to
that of employees working in ASDA's distribution centres, and that the differences in pay and terms and conditions
between the different jobs are not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on
higher wage rates in the distribution centres and those higher wage rates and more favourable terms and conditions
on a prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be served.
At present, the Directors cannot predict the number of claims that may be served, and cannot reasonably estimate
any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Directors believe that there are substantial
factual and legal defences to these claims, and intend to defend the claims vigorously. No provision has been
recognised on the basis that any potential liability arising is not considered probable.

On 5 March 2020, the Group proposed and paid a cash dividend of £1,150.0m to ASDA Holdings UK Limited, the
immediate parent undertaking.

The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 was confirmed in the UK in early 2020 and at the date of approval of the
accounts, is resulting in a high level of disruption to UK economic, social and political activity. The Group considers
the outbreak to be a non-adjusting post Balance Sheet event. The Directors recognise that the impact on forecast
cashflows of the Group is difficult to estimate and have therefore considered a range of scenarios as described in

Reports and Financial Statements
31 December 2018
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of ASDA Group Limited

**Opinion**

We have audited the financial statements of ASDA Group Limited ('the parent company') and its subsidiaries (the
'group') for the year ended 31 December 2018 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated balance sheet, Consolidated statement of changes in equity,
Consolidated statement of cash flows and the related notes 1 to 26, including a summary of significant accounting
policies and the Company balance sheet, Company statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 12,
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in
the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the
preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including FRS 101 "Reduced Disclosure Framework" (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).

In our opinion:

the financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31
December 2018 and of the group's profit for the year then ended;

the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union;

the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance in with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent of the group and parent company in
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK,
including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report
to you where:

the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not
appropriate; or

the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast
significant doubt about the group's or the parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of ASDA Group Limited (continued)

**Other information**

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements
and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to
report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

the strategic report and directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained
in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or directors' report.

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report
to you if, in our opinion:

adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or

the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

**Responsibilities of directors**

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 11, the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

Reports and Financial Statements
31 December 2018
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of ASDA Group Limited (continued)

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent
company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent
company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
auditor's report.

**Use of our report**

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018**

**1** **Accounting policies**

**General information**

The Company is a private company limited by share capital, incorporated and domiciled in England under the
Companies Act 2006 (registration number 1396513).

The address of its registered office is:
ASDA House
Southbank
Great Wilson Street
Leeds
LS11 5AD
UK

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as "the
Group").

These financial statements were authorised for issue by the Board on 28 March 2019.

**Statement of compliance**

The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards and its interpretations adopted by the EU ("adopted IFRSs").

**Summary of significant accounting policies and key accounting estimates**

The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these financial statements are set out below. These
policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.

**Basis of preparation**

The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with adopted IFRSs and under historical cost
accounting rules.

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting
estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the group's accounting
policies.

The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds
(£m) except where otherwise stated.

As described in the Strategic Report, the main activities of the Group are the retailing of food, clothing, general
merchandise products, fuel and services throughout the United Kingdom and online.

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

**Going concern**

The Directors have assessed the Group's ability to continue as a going concern including the review of the forecast
cash flows, future trading performance and existing borrowings in place. Based on this review, the Directors confirm
that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future and accordingly the going
concern basis continues to be appropriate for the preparation of the financial statements.

**Changes in accounting policy**

**New standards, interpretations and amendments effective**

The following have been applied for the first time from 1 January 2018.

**_IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers_**

ASDA Group Limited has applied IFRS 15 in the year on a fully retrospective basis. The standard applies to all
revenue contracts and provides a model for the recognition and measurement of sales of some non-financial assets
(e.g. disposals of property, plant and equipment). The core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue is recognised to
depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which
the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Application is required for annual periods
beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has assessed the impact of these changes and concluded that
there is a net impact of £3.4m relating to deferred revenue on gift cards. This relates to accelerated revenue
recognition of breakage previously deferred for a fixed period after the initial gift card sale which is now recognised
at point of sale. This has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment as shown in the consolidated statement of
changes in equity. The adjustments arising out of the application of IFRS 15 at 1 January 2017 are as follows:
trade and other payables (£4.1m decrease); deferred tax assets (£0.7m decrease) and retained earnings (£3.4m
increase). The impacts at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018 are in line with the impacts at 1 January
2017 and prior year balance sheet amounts have been restated accordingly. There is no income statement impact
in the year or in the prior year.

**_IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement_**

IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' has been applied from 1 January 2018 to replace previous requirements in IAS 39
Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and
measurement of financial instruments, including the new expected credit loss ("ECL") model for calculating
impairment of financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting requirements. IFRS 9 is effective for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has assessed the requirements of IFRS 9 on the carrying
value of financial assets, the classification of financial assets and the application of hedge accounting and has
concluded that there is no material impact on the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2018, 31
December 2017 or 1 January 2017. In respect of the ECL model for determining whether financial assets are
impaired, management has conducted a review of all material intercompany receivables and determined that each
significant counterparty is demonstrably able to settle its liabilities to the Group on demand and in full at 31
December 2018, 31 December 2017 and 1 January 2017. Therefore the probability of default is nil and no
impairment charge has been recorded at 31 December 2018, 31 December 2017 or 1 January 2017.

In relation to trade receivables, due to the short lead times between recognition and settlement of these balances,
management has applied the simplified approach in adopting IFRS 9 and determined that there is no impact on
the carrying value of trade receivables at 31 December 2018, 31 December 2017 or 1 January 2017 resulting from
the adoption of IFRS 9. As such, prior year comparatives have not been restated.

### F-88

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

**New standards, interpretations and amendments not yet effective**

The following newly issued but not yet effective standards, interpretations and amendments, which have not been
applied in these financial statements, will or may have an effect on the company financial statements in future:

**_IFRS 16 – Leases_**

IFRS 16 replaces existing IFRS lease requirements in IAS 17 Leases. The standard provides a single lessee
accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for each lease. Lessor accounting is
substantially unchanged from the current standard. Application is required for annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2019. The Group is using a modified retrospective approach and has elected to measure lease assets
at an amount based on the lease liability. The Group is applying the short term lease exemption and will recognise
rental expense relating to short term leases directly to the income statement.

The Group has reviewed all leases and assessed the impact to the financial statements. The change will have a
significant impact on the Group's balance sheet, specifically a material increase to assets and liabilities. It will also
materially impact the presentation within the income statement as operating profit will increase and finance costs
will increase. Total cash flows are unaffected by the application of IFRS 16.

Details of the Group's operating lease commitments are included in note 21, which show that as at 31 December
2018, the Group had undiscounted operating lease obligations of £2,453.5m.

**Judgements, estimates and assumptions**

Management are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies
and reported assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually
evaluated and are based on historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future events
that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The key estimates and assumptions impacting the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed further
below.

_Impairment of goodwill and brand licence intangible_

The Group has significant carrying value of goodwill and brand related intangible assets held within intangible
assets on the balance sheet. An impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit
exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The fair
value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions in arm's-length
transactions of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The
value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model.

The cash flows are derived from management forecasts for the next five years, with reference to the Board
approved budget for the next three years. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the sales growth, operating
costs, growth rate for extrapolated cash flows and the discount rate. The key assumptions used to determine the
recoverable amount, including a sensitivity analysis, are further explained in note 10.

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

_Supplier Income_

Supplier incentives, rebates, fixed income and discounts are collectively known as "supplier income". Accounting
for the amount and timing of recognition of certain elements of supplier income may require the exercise of
judgement. The three key types of supplier income are explained in the accounting policy on page 33. The areas
requiring a level of judgement and estimation involved are considered below:

Annual supplier rebates – typically these are earned and billed within the financial year of the Group. A small
proportion of rebate agreements may extend beyond the year end and in these cases estimations may be
required of projected sales volumes and judgement may also need to be applied to determine the rebate
level earned if agreements involve multiple tiers. All income accruals are supported by detailed calculations,
based on the explicit terms in each agreement and judgements are minimal, due to the small number of
agreements spanning the year end.

Fixed amount supplier income – the majority of this income is earned and billed within the financial year of the
Group. A small proportion of agreements may not be coterminous with the year end and, in these cases,
any income accrued is supported by detailed calculations. These require judgement to determine when the
terms of the agreement are satisfied and that amounts are recognised in the correct period.

Supplier income recognised in the income statement and accounted for as an offset within trade payables (note
15) at the year-end for which estimation and judgement is required is £0.6m (2017: £0.6m). This represents the
net amount of accrued income (£0.6m) (2017: £0.6m) and deferred income (£nil) (2017: £nil) on deals running
across the year end.

_Intercompany royalty expense_

The Group incurs a royalty charge from the ultimate parent company. The calculation of this is based on the return
on investment of the Group and the operating profit of a subsidiary undertaking within the Group. The calculation
for the years ended 31 December 2018, 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 is under review with the UK
and US tax authorities and the royalty paid in those years has been calculated on the basis agreed for the year
ended 31 December 2015. This amount constitutes the majority of the Walmart Inc. recharge disclosed in note 24.

_Other_

The insurance provision (note 18) relates to liabilities arising from past events which are not covered by third party
insurance. This includes both known and potential claims from stores and depots. Estimates are made with regards
to determining the provision required either by actuarial assessment or based on historical experience.

Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance with
IAS 37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters are
made in contingent liabilities (note 23).

Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be
classified as trade payables or financing. In determining the classification, the Group reviews each arrangement
against a number of characteristics and the legal form of the arrangement is considered. All balances under supply
chain financing arrangements are treated as trade payables.

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

_Pension benefits_

The carrying value of the liabilities relating to the defined benefit pension scheme is determined using an actuarial
valuation. This valuation is based on assumptions. All the assumptions used are estimates of future events. Further
details about the key assumptions used are given in note 17.

_Share-based payment transactions_

The Group estimates fair value for share-based payment transactions depending on the terms and conditions of
the grants. This estimate also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including
assumptions of the expected life of the share option, share price, volatility and dividend yield. The assumptions
and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 17.

_Finance versus operating lease classification_

In assessing whether a lease is finance or operating in nature, assumptions and estimates need to be made
including determination of the implicit interest rate, fair values of properties and the split of land and building
elements of property lease contracts. Market data is used to determine these assumptions.

**Basis of consolidation**

A subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Company. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to
govern the financial and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the income statement from the
effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments
are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used by
the Group.

Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between the Company and its
subsidiaries, which are related parties, are eliminated in full.

**Business combinations and goodwill**

Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' using the acquisition method.
The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition
date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of noncontrolling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets is
determined on a transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in
operating costs. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for
appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and
pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the
consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable
amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination. Identifiable
intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from

### F-91

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition-date fair value can
be measured reliably.

If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for
the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair
value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference is measured in profit and loss.

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of
the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other
assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit, or group of units, to which goodwill is
allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal
management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the
goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when
determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured
based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

**Foreign currency**

The presentational currency of the Group is Sterling. The primary functional currency of the parent and subsidiary
companies is also Sterling.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the
foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences are taken to the income statement, except
when hedge accounting is applied and differences are taken to other comprehensive income.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the spot rate ruling at the balance sheet date. The
income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate
approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.

Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive
income. They are released into the income statement upon disposal.

**Intangible assets**

Intangible assets acquired are carried initially at cost. Following initial recognition, the historic cost model is applied,
with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

**Amortisation**

Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight line basis over their
expected useful lives, with charges included in operating costs, as follows:

Software and development costs 4 to 8 years

Lease buy out costs over the lease term

Other intangibles 3 years

The purchased goodwill of the Group and brand licence intangibles are regarded as having an indefinite useful
economic life and in accordance with IAS 38, are not amortised but are subject to annual tests for impairment.

**Property, plant and equipment**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004, the
date of transition to IFRSs, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of
that revaluation.

Items of property, plant and equipment under construction are valued at cost and not depreciated. Depreciation is
charged from the date the assets are available for use.

Assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to lower of fair value and the present
value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment
losses.

All property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets'.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is
included in the Income Statement.

**Depreciation**

Depreciation is charged to the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each
part of an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Freehold properties 20 – 50 years

Finance leases and leasehold improvements Shorter of 20 – 50 years or the lease term

Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings 3 – 20 years

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

**Impairment of non-financial assets**

The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is
estimated.

An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent
from those of other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable
amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value
in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment
losses on continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent
with the function of the impaired asset.

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units ("CGU") are allocated first to reduce the carrying
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and second, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the
unit on a pro rata basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying
amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been
recognised.

**Provisions**

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a
result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation,
and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect is material, provisions are
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments
of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

**Leases**

The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement
at inception date and whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or
assets and the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.

_Group as a lessee_

Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are
classified as finance leases. Other leases are classified as operating leases.

Where land and buildings are held under leases the determination of the land is considered separately from that
of the buildings.

### F-94


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

_Finance leases_

Assets acquired by way of a finance lease are recognised at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value and the
present value, calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease, of the minimum lease payments at inception
of the lease with a corresponding liability as an obligation to pay future rentals. Lease payments are apportioned
between the finance charge and the outstanding obligation so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the
remaining balance of the liability. Assets are depreciated over the term of the lease.

_Operating leases_

Rental payments are expensed to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Leases that
contain predetermined fixed rental increases are accounted for such that the increases are recognised on a straight
line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement over the lease
term.

Prepaid operating lease rentals are recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.

_Group as a lessor_

Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their
useful economic lives. Rental income, including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight line basis
over the lease term.

**Financial instruments**

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.

_Financial assets and liabilities_

The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities in the following categories: trade and other receivables,
intercompany receivables, derivatives designated as hedges, cash and cash equivalents, interest bearing loans
and borrowings, trade and other payables, and intercompany payables.

Management determines the classification of its instruments at initial recognition.

All financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. The Group assesses financial assets for
impairment using the expected credit losses model and recognises impairment losses as required.

_Loans and receivables_

The Group's loans and receivables, including amounts owed by fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate parent company,
are held with the sole objective of collecting contractual cash flows and are therefore carried at amortised cost.
They are included in current assets except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet
date.

### F-95


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

_Interest bearing loans and borrowings_

Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, these liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or losses
arising on repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income or
finance cost.

_Offsetting of financial instruments_

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet only when there is a
legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise
the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.

_Fair values_

Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm'slength transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted
cash flow analysis or other valuation models.

_Derivative financial instruments and hedging_

Derivative financial instruments ("derivatives") are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations.

Derivatives are stated at their fair value. The fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts is their market value
at the balance sheet date. Market values are calculated using mathematical models and are based on the duration
of derivative together with quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market volatility
at the balance sheet date.

For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship is
formally designated and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured
throughout its duration.

All of the Group's hedges are considered to be cash flow hedges, hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that
are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast
transaction.

For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly as
other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion would be recognised in profit and loss. Amounts
recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement, within cost of inventories
recognised as an expense, when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast purchase
occurs.

### F-96


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income are transferred to profit and loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised
without replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other

comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs and are
transferred to the income statement, within cost of inventories recognised as an expense.

The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast
transactions and firm commitments. Refer to note 16 for further details.

**Inventories**

Inventories comprise goods for resale and goods not for resale and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value.

Goods at warehouses are valued at weighted average cost. Expenditure incurred in acquiring the goods and
bringing them to their existing location and condition (including applicable supplier income) are included in
inventories. Inventories at retail outlets are valued at average cost prices. Goods not for resale primarily comprise
fuel and are valued on a first in, first out basis.

**Taxation**

The tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement,
except that a change attributable to an item of income or expense recognised as other comprehensive income is
also recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for
financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes except:

the initial recognition of goodwill or of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than
in a business combination;

in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the
reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will
not reverse in the foreseeable future; and

deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised.

The amount of deferred tax provided is measured on an undiscounted basis based on the expected manner of
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date.

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

**Trade and other receivables**

Trade and other receivables are stated at their original invoiced value (discounted if material) as reduced by
appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are
assessed as uncollectible.

**Cash and cash equivalents**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and term deposits with an original maturity of three months or
less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand, to the extent that they are used, are included as a component
of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

**Trade and other payables**

Trade and other payables, other than intercompany loans, are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal
value.

**Borrowing costs**

Borrowing costs are recognised in the Group's income statement except for costs that are directly attributable to
the construction of buildings which are capitalised and included within the initial cost of a building. Capitalisation of
borrowing costs ceases when the property is ready for use. The interest rate applied is based on the average rate
of general borrowings outstanding during a period.

**Defined contribution pension plans**

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an operating expense in the
income statement as incurred.

**Defined benefit pension obligation**

The Group's net obligation in respect of its defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in prior periods; that benefit is discounted to
determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The calculation is performed by a
qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The financing costs of the scheme are recognised in the
period in which they arise.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period in
which they occur.

The Group is subject to minimum funding requirements in the UK and does not have an unconditional right to a
refund of a surplus. This results in an obligation which is recognised as an additional liability and a reduction to
other comprehensive income.

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

**Dividend distributions**

Dividend distributions to the Company's shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group's financial
statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's shareholders.

**Revenue recognition**

Revenue represents sales to customers through retail outlets and online, excluding value added tax. Revenue is
recognised net of intragroup transactions, staff discounts, coupons and the free element of multi-save transactions.

_Income from concessions and commissions_

Income from concessions and commissions is based on the terms of the contract and is included within rental
income and other income.

_Interest and dividend income_

Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method.

Dividend income is recognised in the Company's profit on the date the Company's right to receive payments is
established.

**Supplier income**

Supplier incentives, rebates, fixed income and discounts (collectively known as "supplier income") are recognised,
as a deduction from cost of inventories recognised as an expense, as they accrue in accordance with the terms of
each relevant supplier agreement. All supplier income is supported by agreements and, in the majority of instances,
these agreements begin and end within the Group's financial year. In a small number of instances, contractual
periods may extend over the Group's year end. In such cases the amount of any income accrued in relation to
these agreements is supported by detailed calculations.

Supplier income is split into three classifications:

Supplier incentives and discounts – which are usually expressed in the supplier agreement as an agreed amount
per item sold. This type of supplier income is mechanically calculated and therefore no judgement is required
in determining the amount of income to record in the financial year;

Annual supplier rebates – these are earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases.
The rebates are linked to pre-agreed volumes of sales or purchases of specific products and are supported
by explicit contractual terms.

Fixed amount supplier income – this is earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases.
Fixed monetary amounts are agreed with suppliers relating to certain promotional activities including, for
example, new product listings, increased product distribution or specific promotional events.

### F-99

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

Unbilled amounts of income to which the Group is contractually entitled are included in trade and other receivables,
or offset against corresponding trade payables, however these amounts are not considered material. Billed
amounts unpaid at year end are included in trade receivables or offset against corresponding trade payables where
a contractual right of offset exists.

**Share based payments**

For all liabilities arising from share-based payment arrangements the Group has applied IFRS 2 'Share-Based
Payments'.

The share option programmes allow Group employees to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company; these
awards are granted by the Group. The fair value of options granted is initially measured at grant date and spread
over the period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The charge is recognised
as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value of the share option is measured
based on an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were
granted. The liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair
value are recognised in the income statement during the vesting period. These share based payment transactions
are accounted for as cash settled.

**Contingent liabilities**

The Group may, from time to time, be subject to legal proceedings. Where a liability is not probable or the amount
cannot be reasonably estimated, a liability is not recognised. However, where a loss is not considered probable
but a liability is possible and may be material, such matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities.

**2** **Segment reporting**

The Group is engaged in a single reportable operating segment of business, being the retailing of food, clothing,
general merchandise, fuel and services in a single geographical segment, the United Kingdom and online. The
Group is not reliant on any individual major customers.

In line with the Group's reporting framework and management structure, key operating decisions are made by the
Executive Board which is considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Group. All significant
revenue is generated by the sale of goods through retail outlets in the UK and through the Group's online channels.
The operations of all product areas of the business are subject to similar economic characteristics and are sold in
a similar retail environment.

The Group has taken these factors into account together with the core principles of IFRS 8 in determining that it
has a single reportable operating segment.

recorded as a reduction in the Group's current tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2017 and an increase
in intercompany receivables. The re-allocation of group relief had no impact on the total UK corporation tax paid
during the year by the Group on behalf of Broadstreet Great Wilson Europe Limited (see note 25) and its subsidiary
undertakings.

The 2017 restatement of £0.7m relates to the IFRS 15 adjustment in respect of gift cards as detailed in note 1.

Certain properties have been revalued to their fair value prior to 1 January 2004. The tax base of certain land and
buildings has also been adjusted to include within it any rolled-over gains which might subsequently become
chargeable on a future sale of relevant properties. Where it has been calculated that indexation allowance exists
to reduce the temporary difference on these assets, no deferred tax liability is recognised to the extent that
indexation allowance is available.

The Group has unrecognised brought forward capital losses of £336m (2017: £336m) available to reduce future
capital gains. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these capital losses due to uncertainty of
when they may be used.

**Reclassifications**

During the year, assets relating to lease buy outs were reclassified from leasehold improvements to intangible
assets to better reflect the nature of these items. Assets transferred had a gross cost of £3.6m and accumulated
depreciation of £1.0m (see note 10). Additionally, assets relating to finance lease premiums were reclassified from
operating lease prepayments to finance leases to better reflect the nature of these items. Assets transferred had a
gross cost of £12.5m and accumulated depreciation of £4.1m (see note 11).

During the prior year, assets relating to lease buy outs were reclassified from leasehold improvements to intangible
assets to better reflect the nature of these items. Assets transferred had a gross cost of £6.3m and accumulated
depreciation of £1.4m (see note 10).

**Transfers**

During the prior year, costs initially recognised as freehold were transferred to fixtures and fittings to better reflect
the nature of these items. Assets transferred had a gross cost of £9.1m and accumulated depreciation of £3.3m.

**Impairment**

Both the operational and non-operational estate are regularly reviewed for indicators of impairment. Following
reviews in the year, impairment charges of £1.7m (2017: £6.6m) were recognised in the consolidated income
statement.

**Capitalised interest**

The cumulative amount of capitalised interest included in the cost of fixed assets is £273.0m (2017: £273.0m).

The George brand licence has a carrying value of £17.3m (2017: £17.3m) and is generating positive cash flows.
There are no plans to exit the brand and no legal limits on its use by the Group.

Other brand assets are fully amortised (£14.6m cost and accumulated amortisation).

Lease buy out costs represent amounts paid to third parties to enter a leasehold property. These costs are being
amortised over the term of the lease.

Software and development costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 to 8
years.

Other intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of 3 years.

**Reclassifications and transfers**

During the year, assets relating to lease buy outs were reclassified from leasehold improvements to intangible
assets to better reflect the nature of these items. Assets transferred had a gross cost of £3.6m and accumulated
depreciation of £1.0m (see note 9).

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

During the prior year, assets relating to lease buy outs were reclassified from leasehold improvements to intangible
assets to better reflect the nature of these items. Assets transferred had a gross cost of £6.3m and accumulated
depreciation of £1.4m (see note 9).

**Impairment testing of goodwill**

**_Netto Acquisition_**

Goodwill of £482.3m (2017: £482.3m) arose on the acquisition of Netto Foodstores Limited on 13 April 2011. This
has been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2018 by allocating costs directly attributable to Netto stores
and a reasonable allocation of central costs, to the chain of converted Netto stores along with other related assets.
This represents the lowest level to which management monitors goodwill.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from
financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period. This is the period to which specific
reliable forecasts have been made. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8.0% and the
growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the specific forecast period is 1.5%.

The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the assumptions of sales growth, gross margin, operating costs,
growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial forecast period, and the discount rate.

**Sales growth – sales expectations are initially formed based on management expectations of growth of small**
format stores for the foreseeable future. This takes into account historic data and current performance as well as
future market expectations from internal and external sources.

**Gross profit –** Margin assumptions are formed based on management expectations of realistic future margin
forecasts. These expectations are based on historic and current performance combined with internal and external
factors expected to affect gross profit margin in future years.

**Operating costs – some costs are directly attributable to individual stores. Other costs derive from central or**
shared costs for the whole Group and must be allocated to the chain on a reasonable basis. Operating cost
forecasts for the Netto chain reflect a combination of experience since acquisition and existing similar stores from
2011 to 2018 extrapolated as a proportion of sales, and known impacts to costs in future years

**Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial forecast period –** long term growth rate
forecasts are based on a combination of long term economic GDP growth forecasts for the UK and internal
management growth expectations.

**Discount rate – the pre-tax discount rate used in calculating the value in use represents an assessment of the**
rate of return a market participant would expect for an equally risky investment. This has been calculated by
estimating the weighted average cost of capital of the Group.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

With regard to the assessment of value in use, based upon calculations performed, management believe that no
reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the chain of
Netto stores to exceed its recoverable amount.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

**_Turkmen Tedarik Hizmetleri Acquisition_**

Goodwill of £17.0m (2017: £17.0m) arose on the acquisition of Turkmen Tedarik Hizmetleri on 26 April 2012. This
has been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2018 by assessing the present value of forecasted cash savings
arising from the synergies achieved as a result of the acquisition. Goodwill is allocated to a single cash generating
unit, being the acquired sourcing company.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cashflow projections from financial
budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the
cashflow projections is 8.0% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the cashflows beyond specific forecast period
is 0.2%.

The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the assumptions of growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows
beyond the initial forecast period and the discount rate.

**Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial forecast period – long term growth rate**
forecasts are based on long term economic GDP growth forecasts for the UK.

**Discount rate – the pre-tax discount rate used in calculating the value in use represents an assessment of the**
rate of return a market participant would expect for an equally risky investment. This has been calculated by
estimating the weighted average cost of capital of the Group.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

With regard to the assessment of value in use, based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis
undertaken, management believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would
cause the carrying value of the Turkmen goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

**Impairment testing of indefinite life intangibles**

**_George brand licence_**

This asset relates to the acquisition in 2006 of a perpetual licence to use the George brand and has a carrying
value of £17.3m (2017: £17.3m). This has been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2018 by assessing the
present value of forecasted cash flows arising from the George clothing business.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from
financial budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied
to the cash flow projections is 8.0% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond specific forecast
period is 0.5%.

Based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis undertaken, management believe that no reasonably
possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be lower than the
carrying value of the George brand.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30 day terms. Trade receivable balances have
been assessed to determine the value of expected credit losses ("ECLs") using the simplified approach in IFRS 9.
There is no material impact on prior year balances resulting from the application of the ECL model, therefore prior
year comparatives have not been restated.

Trade receivables are presented net where a legally enforceable right of set off exists. Included in the above is an
offset of £108.8m (note 15) (2017: £98.0m). The gross trade receivable prior to the offset is £242.3m (2017:
£226.9m).

Other receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 60 day terms. Other receivable balances have
been assessed to determine the value of ECLs in IFRS 9 and it was determined that the impact was £nil. There is
no material impact on prior year balances resulting from the application of the ECL model, therefore prior year
comparatives have not been restated.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

The Group considers its trade and other receivables in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due.
However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a trade or other receivable to be in default when internal
or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full
before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A trade or other receivable is written off
when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows.

As at 31 December 2018, trade receivables at nominal value of £3.9m (2017: £3.9m) were impaired and fully
provided for. Movements in the allowance for expected credit losses in the year were as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**

The 2017 restatement of £4.1m relates to the IFRS 15 adjustment in respect of gift cards as detailed in note 1.

The Group deals with over ten thousand separate suppliers and has established trading terms which are
appropriate to the particular relationship and product supplied. Whenever an order is placed the parties will be
aware of the payment terms and it is the Group's policy to abide by these terms when satisfactory invoices have
been received.

Trade receivables are presented net where a legally enforceable right of set off exists. Included in the above is an
offset of £108.8m (note 13) (2017: £98.0m). The gross trade payable prior to the offset is £2,970.7m (2017:
£2,708.0m).

As at 31 December 2018 and 31 December 2017, all borrowings were in Sterling at fixed rates of interest. The
finance lease obligations are carried at amortised cost, which is considered to approximate to fair value. The
interest rate of fixed rate debt is 5.448%-6% (2017: 5.448%-6%).
Intercompany payables are disclosed in note 24. Details of obligations under finance leases are included in note
21. The increase in finance leases in the year of £13.3m includes increases due to non-cash movements of £25.1m,
partially offset by cash payments of £11.8m.
**_Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities_**
The Group's principal financial instruments during the year comprised cash, cash equivalents, intercompany
payables and receivables, derivatives classified as hedges and borrowings. Other financial assets and liabilities,
such as trade receivables, other receivables, trade payables, other payables, and accruals arise directly from the
Group's operating activities. The difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the Group's financial
instruments is not material.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial
instruments:

### F-113


-----

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

_Fixed rate borrowings – the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted_
cash flow using appropriate interest rates to net present value. All fixed rate borrowings are held with fellow
subsidiaries of the ultimate parent company and included within intercompany payables.

_Derivatives – derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of forward contracts_
entered into and are split between in the money (assets) and out of the money (liabilities). At 31 December 2018
the Group held £41.0m (2017: £nil) in the money assets, and £0.6m (2017: £29.4m) out of the money liabilities in
respect of its forward contracts. During the year, the Group recognised losses on revaluation of hedged monetary
liabilities from historical cost to year-end spot rate of £7.4m (2017: £22.6m loss).

The fair values of the Group's financial derivatives and fixed rate borrowings with fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate
parent company have been calculated at observable unquoted interest rates, and are categorised as Level 2 within
the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement'. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than
quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

_Financial risk management_

The Treasury function manages the Group's financial risk, considering its borrowings and exposure to foreign
currency fluctuations. The Group finances its operations through intercompany borrowings which were issued a
number of years ago and are wholly held within the Walmart Inc. group. The Group utilises its cash balances, and
has access to bank overdrafts, to satisfy short-term cash flow requirements. Foreign currency exposure is managed
through entering into forward currency contracts.

_Interest rate risk_

The Group's short term borrowings are all held with entities which are part of the Walmart Inc. group and are at
fixed rates of interest. Amounts owed to fellow subsidiaries (note 24) attract interest at a rate of 5.448% – 6%
(2017: 5.448-6%). As interest rates are fixed on all of the Group's debt, interest rate movements would not have
an impact on profitability, cash flow or equity.

The Group does not expect to take out borrowings with a variable interest rate in the foreseeable future.

_Foreign currency risk_

The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be
affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are
managed through the use of forward contracts.

The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31 December
2018, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward currency
contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases. The terms of the forward
currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a
period of more than 12 months after 31 December 2018. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are
transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.

The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31
December 2018, a net unrealised gain of £29.6m (2017: £21.0m loss) was included in the hedging reserve in
respect of hedging contracts. The net gain recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect
of these hedging contracts was £50.6m (2017: £57.8m loss). This consists of a £24.2m loss reclassified to the
Income

### F-114

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

Statement during the year (2017: £35.9m gain), a £38.3m gain on not-yet-matured contracts during the year (2017:
£34.4m loss), and a £11.9m taxation charge (2017: £12.5m credit).

Under the Group's hedging policy, the only items for which forward currency contracts are in place are forecast
purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 95% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses attributable
to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the income statement
upon maturity of the forward contract. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash flows
would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the year (2017:
none), therefore amounts recognised in the income statement in relation to ineffective hedges is £nil (2017: £nil).

As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure through the use of forward currency contracts,
changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short term profitability or cash flow. It
is anticipated that a 5% movement in the US dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management's
assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of
£36.6m (2017: £42.1m).

_Credit risk_

There is no significant credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is
included in their carrying value as at the balance sheet date. See note 13 for further information on trade receivables
and details of recoverability.

The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default by trade debtors including detailed credit
checks undertaken before a customer is accepted. Historically, these procedures have proved effective in
minimising the level of impaired and past due debtors.

Surplus cash is placed on short term deposit with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Group
treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit. Deposit limits
and approved financial institutions are dictated by the investment policy of the ultimate parent company.

Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses model under IFRS 9 and
no impairment is required.

_Liquidity risk_

The Group's Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring rolling
forecasts of the Group's cash flows. The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding
and flexibility through the use of operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At 31 December 2018 the Group
had no external borrowings.

As at 31 December 2018, the Group held cash of £2,916.1m (2017: £2,171.7m), utilised along with overdrafts
where necessary, to secure short term flexibility. At 31 December 2018, the Group had committed overdraft facilities
of £30.0m (2017: £30.0m), standby credit facilities, including bonds of £112.1m (2017: £112.9m), and committed
line of credit facilities of £125.0m (2017: £125.0m). The Group also has use of a facility which is available to other
subsidiaries of the ultimate parent, the limit of which depends on the usage by fellow subsidiaries.

The Group operates a trust based defined contribution pension plan for employees of ASDA Stores Limited. The
assets of the plan are held by the Legal & General Assurance Society Ltd and the Prudential Life Assurance
Company. There are additional defined contribution pension plans for the employees of International Procurement
and Logistics Limited, Forza Foods Limited and Kober Limited, for which the value of contributions is not material.

**Defined benefit pension schemes**

The Group also operates two final salary defined benefit plans in the UK (one funded and one unfunded) which are
closed to future accrual. With effect from 12 February 2011, the link between past service benefits and future salary
increases was removed. The assets of the funded plan are placed by the Trustee under the management of a
number of professional fund managers and are held separately from the Group's assets. The Trustee invests in a
range of assets including bonds, equity securities and assets that will hedge movements in the liabilities. A derisking plan was agreed in 2011 whereby the proportion of plan assets invested in liability hedging assets will
increase over the period to 2021.

### F-117

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2018 (continued)**

Responsibility for governance of the plans – including investment decisions and contribution schedules – lies with
two corporate trustee companies. The Board of the defined benefit plan corporate trustee company is made up of
nine trustees: five of these are member nominated trustees including two pensioners, two are company appointed,
and there are two professional independent trustees. The Board of the defined contribution plan corporate trustee
company is made up of seven trustees: three of these are member nominated, three are company appointed, and
there is one professional independent trustee.

The Group's ultimate parent company Walmart Inc., guarantees the Group's obligations to the funded defined
benefit plan up to a maximum amount of £980.0m. This guarantee has no time limit.

A schedule of contributions is in place between the Group and Trustee of the funded defined benefit plan in order
to pay down the deficit on a secondary funding objective basis. The current schedule was agreed in 2017. A long
term funding agreement was entered into in 2015 whereby contributions will continue until the scheme is fully
funded on a self-sufficiency basis.

The scheme was most recently valued on 5 April 2016. At the time of the April 2016 triennial valuation, this resulted
in contributions of £70.0m per annum being paid into the scheme until April 2032.

Under IFRIC 14 this is considered to be a minimum funding requirement (also known as a statutory funding
objective). At the current year end, the plan is in surplus; however, contributions remain payable until 2032 in order
to meet the statutory funding objective. As the plan rules do not provide the Group with an unconditional right to a
refund in the event of a surplus, under the requirements of IFRIC 14 the minimum funding requirement creates an
obligation which is recognised as an additional liability of £1,022.4m (2017: £945.4m).

The expected future benefit payments from the defined benefit plans are based on a number of assumptions
including future inflation, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and are therefore inherently
uncertain. Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner
or later than assumed, or take a greater or lesser cash lump sum at retirement. The estimated duration of pension
plan liabilities, which is an indicator of the weighted average term of the liabilities, is 22 years (2017: 23 years)
although the benefits payable by the pension plans are expected to be paid over more than 80 years.

In order to mitigate the risk of volatility in the value of plan assets, a diverse portfolio of investments is held. This
includes an allocation to liability matching assets which mitigate the risk of volatility in the funding level. The majority
of these assets are bonds and are included within debt securities in the table above. These liability matching assets
partially hedge the scheme's interest rate risk and inflation risk, as they move in line with change in interest rate
and future inflation expectations in a similar manner to the Scheme's liabilities. These risks are not fully hedged
and the interest rate risk is hedged on a long term funding basis (gilts) rather than a corporate bonds basis. Other
risks to the scheme include longevity risk.

**_Principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages)_**

Future UK pensioners at retirement age – male 24.6 24.6
Future UK pensioners at retirement age – female 26.6 26.5

**Sensitivity analysis**

The assumptions on the discount rate, inflation, and life expectancy all have a significant effect on the measurement
of the present value of the scheme liabilities. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the IAS
19 pension liability at 31 December 2018 and of the Income Statement charge for 2018, to changes in these
assumptions.

A sensitivity analysis for the principal assumptions used to measure scheme liabilities is set out below:

**Year ended 31** **Year ended 31**
**December** **December**
**2018** **2017**
**+ 0.1%** **+ 0.1%**

**Adjustment to discount rate** **£ m** **£ m**

**+ 0.1%** **+ 0.1%**

**Adjustment to discount rate** **£ m** **£ m**

Increase in liability 70.7 75.8
Increase in finance costs 2.1 1.8

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions
constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When
calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in actuarial assumptions the same method
(present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the
reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet.
These sensitivities exclude the impact of the onerous liability.

The methods and changes in assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis are the same as those used
in the previous period.

**Share-based payments**

Share-based payment transactions are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 'Share-Based Payments'.

The Group offers four share-based payment schemes to employees to enable them to own shares in the ultimate
parent company, Walmart Inc. The Group has the obligation to settle the liabilities for the schemes, including
employment taxes for participating employees, and therefore these schemes are accounted for as cash settled
liabilities.

The impact is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of Walmart Inc. and the share options would not
be revalued during the vesting period if the Group were granting options on its own shares in a way consistent with
UK public limited companies. Two of these schemes involve the granting of options to employees to acquire shares
in the ultimate parent company at pre-determined exercise prices and two of the schemes involve the granting of
rights to receive shares in the ultimate parent company for nil consideration. The Performance Share Plan ("PSP")
has performance conditions relating to the total payout of options issued. No other scheme has any performance
conditions attached to the scheme.

The total expenses recognised for the year arising from share based payments and the associated amounts
recognised in the Balance Sheet are as follows:

**Year ended 31** **Year ended 31**

The scheme has been in existence for employees since 1982 and gained HMRC approval in 2000. Employees
with six months' service are invited to join the scheme annually. Options are granted annually to employees who
elect to join, and are exercisable in three or five years from date of grant, depending on the year of grant. Currently
only three year grants are being offered. The options under this scheme are treated as cash-settled. The exercise
price of the options granted is equal to the market price of the shares less 20% on the date of grant.

_Performance Share Plan (PSP) scheme_

The Group offers a PSP scheme, for which conditions exist in relation to exercise as described below.

The scheme came into existence on 20 July 2006. Under the scheme, selected executives are granted the right to
receive shares in Walmart Inc. provided certain pre-determined performance goals are met. These pre-determined
goals are in respect of sales growth and return on investment. All share awards under the PSP scheme have been
issued for nil consideration and have a contractual life of between 1 and 3 years. The share awards under this
scheme are treated as cash-settled.

The number of share awards under the PSP scheme is as follows:

**Year ended 31** **Year ended 31**
**December** **December**
**2018** **2017**
**Number** **Number**
**(thousands)** **(thousands)**

Outstanding, start of year 196 184

Granted during the year 88 119
Forfeited during the year (37) (55)

Outstanding, end of year 179 196
Exercisable, end of year - 
The fair value of the options outstanding under the PSP scheme at 31 December 2018 is £12.0m (2017: £11.0m).

The fair value of share options is measured using a Black-Scholes model taking into account the terms and
conditions upon which the instruments were granted.

The following table gives the weighted average assumptions applied to the options granted during the year and
are outstanding in the respective periods shown.

**Year ended 31** **Year ended 31**
**December** **December**
**2018** **2017**

Expected dividend yield (%) 2.22 2.07

Risk-free interest rate (%) 2.63 1.76
Weighted average fair value of options granted (£) 13.67 14.79
Weighted average exercise price (£) 45.27 42.04

The expected life of the option in the year was 3 or 5 years (2017: 3 or 5 years).

Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price is expected to fluctuate during the year. The Group has used
historical volatilities that correlate with the expected term of the options.

Share options are exercisable in US dollars and the risk free interest rate is based on the applicable US Treasury
rate.

Non-current liabilities 74.2 4.0 79.1 157.3

The insurance provision above relates to claims liabilities arising from past events such as accidents in our depots
and stores which are not covered by third party insurance. The value of the provision is established using
independent actuarial assessments or a reasonable estimate based on past experience. These provisions are
expected to crystallise within 5 years.

The dilapidations provision represents provisions for the cost of repairs to leasehold properties at the end of their
lease term. The amount provided during the year is accounted for within additions as an increase in the cost of
property, plant and equipment and the impact of this will be recognised as additional depreciation over the lease
terms of the sites to which the provision relates.

£803.2m) and energy for £65.3m (2017: £42.0m).

**23 Contingent liabilities**

Equal Value Claims: ASDA Stores Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, has been served with circa
30,000 employment tribunal claims that have been presented on behalf of current and former ASDA store
employees, who allege that their work in ASDA's stores is of equal value in terms of the demands of their jobs to
that of employees working in ASDA's distribution centres, and that the differences in pay and terms and conditions
between the different jobs are not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on
higher wage rates in the distribution centres and those higher wage rates and more favourable terms and conditions
on a prospective basis as part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be served.
At present, the Directors cannot predict the number of claims that may be served, and cannot reasonably estimate
any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. The Directors believe that there are substantial
factual and legal defences to these claims, and intend to defend the claims vigorously. No provision has been
recognised on the basis that any potential liability arising is not considered probable.

### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2017

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ASDA GROUP LIMITED**

**Opinion**

We have audited the financial statements of ASDA Group Limited ('the parent company') and its subsidiaries (the
'group') for the year ended 31 December 2017 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, Consolidated
statement of comprehensive income, Consolidated balance sheet, Consolidated statement of changes in equity,
Consolidated statement of cash flows and the related notes 1 to 30, including a summary of significant accounting
policies and the Company balance sheet, Company statement of changes in equity and the related notes 1 to 13,
including a summary of significant accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in
the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the
preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards, including FRS 101 "Reduced Disclosure Framework" (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice).

In our opinion:

the financial statements give a true and fair view of the group's and of the parent company's affairs as at 31
December 2017 and of the group's profit for the year then ended;

the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European
Union;

the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance in with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.

**Basis for opinion**

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor's responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report below. We are independent of the group and parent company in
accordance with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK,
including the FRC's Ethical Standard, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements.

We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

**Use of our report**

This report is made solely to the company's members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company's members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ASDA GROUP LIMITED (CONTINUED)**

**Conclusions relating to going concern**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the ISAs (UK) require us to report
to you where:

the directors' use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is not
appropriate; or

the directors have not disclosed in the financial statements any identified material uncertainties that may cast
significant doubt about the group's or the parent company's ability to continue to adopt the going concern
basis of accounting for a period of at least twelve months from the date when the financial statements are
authorised for issue.

**Other information**

The other information comprises the information included in the annual report set out on pages 1 to 8, other than
the financial statements and our auditor's report thereon. The directors are responsible for the other information.

Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the extent otherwise
explicitly stated in this report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.

In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in
doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our
knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify such material
inconsistencies or apparent material misstatements, we are required to determine whether there is a material
misstatement in the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work
we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of the other information, we are required to
report that fact.

We have nothing to report in this regard.

**Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:

the information given in the strategic report and the directors' report for the financial year for which the financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and

the strategic report and directors' report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal requirements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the group and the parent company and its environment obtained
in the course of the audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or directors' report.

### Registered No: 1396513 Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2017

**INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF ASDA GROUP LIMITED (CONTINUED)**

We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires
us to report to you if, in our opinion:

adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or

the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or

certain disclosures of directors' remuneration specified by law are not made; or

we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

**Responsibilities of directors**

As explained more fully in the directors' responsibilities statement set out on page 9, the directors are responsible
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for
such internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the group's and the parent
company's ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and
using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the group or the parent
company or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so.

**Auditor's responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements**

Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence
the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.

A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council's website at https://www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our
auditor's report

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017**

**_(forming part of the financial statements)_**

**1** **Accounting policies**

**_General information_**

ASDA Group Limited (the "Company") is a company incorporated and domiciled in England under the Companies Act
2006 (registration number 1396513). The address of the registered office is ASDA House, Southbank, Great Wilson
Street, Leeds, LS11 5AD, UK.

The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as "the
Group").

As described in the strategic report, the main activities of the Group are the retailing of food, clothing, home and leisure
products and services throughout the United Kingdom and online.

**_Authorisation of financial statements and statement of compliance with IFRSs_**

The financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue by the directors
on 15 May 2018 and the Balance Sheet was signed on behalf of the directors by A Russo.

The Group financial statements have been prepared and approved by the directors in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU ("IFRSs").

**_Basis of preparation_**

The directors have assessed the Group's ability to continue as a going concern including the review of the forecast
cash flows, future trading performance and existing borrowings in place. Based on this review, the directors confirm
that the Group has adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future and accordingly the going
concern basis continues to be appropriate for the preparation of the financial statements.

The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest million pounds (£m)
except where otherwise stated.

The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented
in these Group financial statements.

**_Changes in accounting policies_**

The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year. There are no IFRS, IAS
amendments or IFRIC interpretations effective for the first time this financial year which have had a material impact on
the group.

### F-142

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

**_Standards issued but not yet effective_**

The standards and interpretations that are issued, but not yet effective, up to the date of issuance of the Group's
financial statements that are relevant to the Group are disclosed below. The Group intends to adopt these standards
when they become effective.

**IFRS 15 – Revenue from Contracts with Customers**

IFRS 15 replaces existing IFRS revenue recognition requirements in IAS 18 Revenue. The standard applies to all
revenue contracts and provides a model for the recognition and measurement of sales of some non-financial assets
(e.g. disposals of property, plant and equipment). The core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue is recognised to depict
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Application is required for annual periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2018. The Group has assessed the impact of these changes and concluded that there is no material
impact to the consolidated financial statements. This is due to the fact that the majority of the revenue for the Group
relates to sale of goods in stores and online where the recognition of revenue as a result of transfer of control is at the
till or at the point goods are delivered.

**_Standards issued but not yet effective (continued)_**

**IFRS 16 – Leases**

IFRS 16 replaces existing IFRS lease requirements in IAS 17 Leases. The standard applies to all lease contracts over
12 months and provides a single lessee accounting model, requiring lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for each
lease. Lessor accounting is substantially unchanged from the current standard. Application is required for annual
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. The Group has reviewed all leases and is currently assessing the impact
of the changes and has not concluded the impact of these on the consolidated financial statements at this stage. It is
expected that the change will have a significant impact on the balance sheet and presentation within the income
statement for the Group. Details of the Group's operating lease commitments are included in note 24, which show that
as at 31 December 2017, the Group had undiscounted operating lease obligations of £2,527.8m.

**IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments: Classification and Measurement**

IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' replaces the existing requirements in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement. IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments,
including the new expected credit loss model for calculating impairment of financial assets, and the new general hedge
accounting requirements. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group does
not expect there to be a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the Group.

Other than those standards and amendments described above, there are no other IFRS, IAS amendments or IFRIC
interpretations which are not yet effective that would be expected to have a material impact on the group.

**_Judgements, estimates and assumptions_**

Management are required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and
reported assets and liabilities, income and expenses. Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually

### F-143

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

evaluated and are based on historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future events that
are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.

The key estimates and assumptions impacting the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed further below.

_Impairment of brand intangible and goodwill_

The Group has significant carrying value of goodwill and brand related intangible assets held within intangible assets
on the balance sheet. An impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its
recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The fair value less costs
to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions in arm's-length transactions of similar
assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is
based on a discounted cash flow model.

The cash flows are derived from management forecasts for the next five years, with reference to the Board approved
budget for the next three years. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the sales growth, operating costs, growth
rate for extrapolated cash flows and the discount rate. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount,
including a sensitivity analysis, are further explained in note 11.

**_Judgements, estimates and assumptions (continued)_**

_Supplier Income_

Supplier incentives, rebates, fixed income and discounts are collectively known as "supplier income". Accounting for
the amount and timing of recognition of certain elements of supplier income may require the exercise of judgement.
The three key types of supplier income are explained in the accounting policy on page 25. The areas requiring a level
of judgement and estimation involved are considered below:

Annual supplier rebates – typically these are earned and billed within the financial year of the Group. A small proportion
of rebate agreements may extend beyond the year end and in these cases, estimations may be required of
projected sales volumes and judgement may also need to be applied to determine the rebate level earned if
agreements involve multiple tiers. All income accruals are supported by detailed calculations, based on the
explicit terms in each agreement and judgements are minimal, due to the small number of agreements spanning
the year end.

Fixed amount supplier income – the majority of this income is earned and billed within the financial year of the Group.
A small proportion of agreements may not be coterminous with the year end and, in these cases, any income
accrued is supported by detailed calculations. These require judgement to determine when the terms of the
agreement are satisfied and that amounts are recognised in the correct period.

Supplier income recognised in the income statement and accounted for as an offset within trade payables (note 16) at
the year-end for which estimation and judgement is required is £0.6m (2016: £0.4m). This represents the net amount
of accrued income (£0.6m) (2016: £0.4m) and deferred income (£nil) (2016: £nil) on deals running across the year end.

### F-144


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

_Intercompany royalty expense_

The Group incurs a royalty charge from the ultimate parent company. The calculation of this is based on the return on
investment of the Group and the operating profit of a subsidiary undertaking within the Group. The calculation for the
years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 is under review with the UK and US tax authorities and the
royalty paid in both years has been calculated on the basis agreed for the year ended 31 December 2015. This amount
constitutes the majority of the Walmart Inc. recharge disclosed in note 28.

_Other_

The insurance provision (note 19) relates to liabilities arising from past events which are not covered by third party
insurance. This includes both known and potential claims from stores and depots. Estimates are made with regards to
determining the provision required either by actuarial assessment or based on historical experience.

Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance with IAS
37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters are made in
contingent liabilities (note 26).

Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be classified
as trade payables or financing. In determining the classification, the Group reviews each arrangement against a number
of characteristics and the legal form of the arrangement is considered. All balances under supply chain financing
arrangements are currently treated as trade payables.

In the prior year, judgement was applied in determining whether control exists in instances where a majority equity
interest is not held. During the prior year, the Group acquired the non-controlling interests in the two entities where it
was previously considered that control existed without a majority equity holding. From the date of these equity
acquisitions, this judgement is no longer required (note 27). In previously determining whether control existed, the
Group considered whether indicators of control were present including the right to financially benefit from the operations
of the Company, the ability to influence the composition of the board, the ability to significantly influence the operating
and financial activities of each entity and the ability to actively participate in key decision making due to the signing of
legal agreements.

_Pension benefits_

The carrying value of the liabilities relating to the defined benefit pension scheme is valued using an actuarial valuation.
This valuation is based on assumptions. All the assumptions used are estimates of future events. Further details about
the key assumptions used are given in note 18.

_Share-based payment transactions_

The Group estimates fair value for share-based payment transactions depending on the terms and conditions of the
grants. This estimate also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including
assumptions of the expected life of the share option, share price, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions
about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are
disclosed in note 18.

### F-145


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

_Finance versus operating lease classification_

In assessing whether a lease is finance or operating in nature, assumptions and estimates need to be made including
determination of the implicit interest rate, fair values of properties and the split of land and building elements of property
lease contracts. Market data is used to determine these assumptions.

**_Basis of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Group and its subsidiaries as at 31
December 2017. Control exists when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with
the investee, and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. The financial statements of
subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date
that control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent
company however the results of International Procurement and Logistics Limited, and its subsidiaries, are consolidated
one month in arrears. All intragroup balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are
eliminated.

Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the
consolidated financial statements for the relevant period the Group has control over the subsidiary.

The profit or loss for the year is attributed to the equity holders of both the parent of the Group, and to the non-controlling
interests.

Subsidiaries which the Group controls but does not own are consolidated at carrying value, the difference between the
carrying value and fair value of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries is not material. The carrying value of the
non-controlling interests is recognised separately in equity and the profit attributable to non-controlling interests is
disclosed separately within the consolidated income statement.

**_Business combinations and goodwill_**

Business combinations are accounted for under IFRS 3 'Business Combinations' using the acquisition method. The
cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair
value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of non-controlling
interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets is determined on a
transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in operating costs. When the
Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and
designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the
acquisition date.

Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the
consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts
of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination. Identifiable intangible
assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent
liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition-date fair value can be measured reliably.

If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the
non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any
pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference is measured in profit and loss.

### F-146


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of
impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the
Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets
or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit, or group of units, to which goodwill is allocated shall
represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and
not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation.

Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill
associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the
gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative
values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.

**_Foreign currency_**

The presentational currency of the Group is Sterling. The primary functional currency of the parent and subsidiary
companies is also Sterling.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign
exchange rate ruling at that date.  Foreign exchange differences are taken to the income statement, except when
hedge accounting is applied and differences are taken to other comprehensive income.

Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction.

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at the spot rate ruling at the balance sheet date. The
income and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate
approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.

Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensive income.
They are released into the income statement upon disposal.

**_Intangible assets_**

Intangible assets acquired are carried initially at cost. Following initial recognition, the historic cost model is applied,
with intangible assets being carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses.
Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected
useful lives, with charges included in operating costs, as follows:

Software and development costs 4 years

Lease buy out costs over the lease term

Other intangibles 3 years

The purchased goodwill of the Group and brand intangibles are regarded as having an indefinite useful economic life
and in accordance with IAS 38, are not amortised but are subject to annual tests for impairment.

### F-147

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Certain items of property, plant and equipment that had been revalued to fair value prior to 1 January 2004, the date
of transition to IFRSs, are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that
revaluation.

Items of property, plant and equipment under construction are valued at cost and not depreciated. Depreciation is
charged from the date the assets are available for use.

Assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to lower of fair value and the present value
of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.

Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of
an item of property, plant and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:

Freehold properties 20 – 50 years

Finance leases
and leasehold improvements Shorter of 20 – 50 years or the lease term

Plant, equipment, fixtures and fittings 3 – 20 years

All property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 'Impairment of Assets'.

An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are
expected to arise from the continued use of the asset. Any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is
included in the income statement.

**_Impairment of non-financial assets_**

The carrying amounts of the Group's non-financial assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether
there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated.

An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is
determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent from
those of other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the
asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses on continuing
operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the
impaired asset.

### F-148


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units ("CGU") are allocated first to reduce the carrying
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and second, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the
unit on a pro rata basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are
largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

**_Provisions_**

A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result
of a past event, it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable
estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting
the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money
and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.

**_Leases_**

The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at
inception date and whether the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and
the arrangement conveys a right to use the asset.

_Group as a lessee_

Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are
classified as finance leases. Other leases are classified as operating leases.

Where land and buildings are held under leases the determination of the land is considered separately from that of the
buildings.

_Finance leases_

Assets acquired by way of a finance lease are recognised at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value and the
present value, calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease, of the minimum lease payments at inception of
the lease with a corresponding liability as an obligation to pay future rentals. Lease payments are apportioned between
the finance charge and the outstanding obligation so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance
of the liability. Assets are depreciated over the term of the lease.

_Operating leases_

Rental payments are expensed to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Leases that
contain predetermined fixed rental increases are accounted for such that the increases are recognised on a straight
line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement over the lease term.

Prepaid operating lease rentals are recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

_Group as a lessor_

Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their
useful economic lives. Rental income, including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight line basis
over the lease term.

**_Financial instruments_**

Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the
relevant instrument and derecognised when it ceases to be a party to such provisions.

_Financial assets and liabilities_

The Group classifies its financial assets and liabilities in the following categories: financial assets at fair value through
profit and loss, loans and receivables, interest bearing loans and borrowings, derivatives designated as hedges and
trade payables.

Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at
every reporting date.

All financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date
whether there is objective evidence that financial assets are impaired.

_Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss_

Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included in the income
statement in the period in which they arise.

_Loans and receivables_

Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in
an active market and are carried at amortised cost. They are included in current assets except for those with maturities
greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables.

_Interest bearing loans and borrowings_

Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequently, these liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or losses arising
on repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income or finance cost.

### F-150


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

_Offsetting of financial instruments_

Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet only when there is a legally
enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset
and settle the liability simultaneously.

_Fair values_

Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm'slength transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash
flow analysis or other valuation models.

_Derivative financial instruments and hedging_

Derivative financial instruments ("derivatives") are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency
exchange rate fluctuations.

Derivatives are stated at their fair value. The fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts is their market value at
the balance sheet date. Market values are calculated using mathematical models and are based on the duration of
derivative together with quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market volatility at the
balance sheet date.

For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship is
formally designated and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management objective
and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured
throughout its duration.

All of the Group's hedges are considered to be cash flow hedges, hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that are
either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast
transaction.

For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly as other
comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit and loss. Amounts recognised in other
comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement, within cost of inventories recognised as an expense,
when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs.

If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive
income are transferred to profit and loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without
replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other
comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred
to the income statement, within cost of inventories recognised as an expense as part of operating costs.

The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions
and firm commitments. Refer to note 17 for further details.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

**_Inventories_**

Inventories comprise goods for resale and goods not for resale and are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable
value.

Goods at warehouses are valued at weighted average cost. Expenditure incurred in acquiring the goods and bringing
them to their existing location and condition (including applicable supplier income) are included in inventories.
Inventories at retail outlets are valued at average cost prices. Goods not for resale primarily comprise fuel and are
valued on a first in, first out basis.

**_Trade and other receivables_**

Trade and other receivables are stated at their original invoiced value (discounted if material) as reduced by appropriate
allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Impaired debts are derecognised when they are assessed as
uncollectible.

**_Cash and cash equivalents_**

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group's cash management are included
as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

**_Trade and other payables_**

Trade and other payables, other than intercompany loans, are non-interest bearing and are stated at their nominal
value.

**_Taxation_**

Taxation comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it
relates to items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income, in which case it is recognised in equity
or other comprehensive income.

Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.

Deferred tax is provided on all temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial
reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes except:

the initial recognition of goodwill or of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in
a business combination;

in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal
of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse
in the foreseeable future; and

### F-152


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised.

The amount of deferred tax provided is measured on an undiscounted basis based on the expected manner of
realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted
at the balance sheet date.

**_Borrowing costs_**

Borrowing costs are recognised in the Group's income statement except for costs that are directly attributable to the
construction of buildings which are capitalised and included within the initial cost of a building. Capitalisation of
borrowing costs ceases when the property is ready for use. The interest rate applied is based on the average rate of
general borrowings outstanding during a period.

**_Pensions and other post-employment benefits_**

_Defined contribution plans_

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an operating expense in the
income statement as incurred.

_Defined benefit plans_

The Group's net obligation in respect of its defined benefit pension plans is calculated by estimating the amount of
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in prior periods; that benefit is discounted to
determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The calculation is performed by a qualified
actuary using the projected unit credit method. The financing costs of the scheme are recognised in the period in which
they arise.

Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the statement of other comprehensive income in the period in which
they occur.

The Group is subject to minimum funding requirements in the UK and does not have an unconditional right to a refund
of a surplus. This results in an obligation which is recognised as an additional liability and a reduction to other
comprehensive income.

**_Revenue recognition_**

Revenue represents sales to customers through retail outlets and online, excluding value added tax. Revenue is
recognised net of intragroup transactions, staff discounts, coupons and the free element of multi-save transactions.

_Income from concessions and commissions_

Income from concessions and commissions is based on the terms of the contract and is included within rental income.

### F-153

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

_Interest and dividend income_

Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend
income is recognised in the income statement on the date the Company's right to receive payments is established.

**_Supplier income_**

Supplier incentives, rebates, fixed income and discounts (collectively known as "supplier income") are recognised, as
a deduction from cost of inventories recognised as an expense, as they accrue in accordance with the terms of each
relevant supplier agreement. All supplier income is supported by agreements and, in the majority of instances, these
agreements begin and end within the Group's financial year. In a small number of instances, contractual periods may
extend over the Group's year end. In such cases the amount of any income accrued in relation to these agreements
is supported by detailed calculations.

Supplier income is split into three classifications:

Supplier incentives and discounts – which are usually expressed in the supplier agreement as an agreed amount per
item sold. This type of supplier income is mechanically calculated and therefore no judgement is required in
determining the amount of income to record in the financial year;

Annual supplier rebates – these are earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases. The
rebates are linked to pre-agreed volumes of sales or purchases of specific products and are supported by explicit
contractual terms.

Fixed amount supplier income – this is earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases.
Fixed monetary amounts are agreed with suppliers relating to certain promotional activities including, for
example, new product listings, increased product distribution or specific promotional events.

Unbilled amounts of income to which the Group is contractually entitled are included in trade and other receivables, or
offset against corresponding trade payables, however these amounts are not considered material. Billed amounts
unpaid at year end are included in trade receivables or offset against corresponding trade payables where a contractual
right of offset exists.

**_Share-based payments_**

For all liabilities arising from share-based payment arrangements the Group has applied IFRS 2 _'Share-Based_
_Payments'._

The share option programmes allow Group employees to acquire shares of the ultimate parent company; these awards
are granted by the Group. The fair value of options granted is initially measured at grant date and spread over the
period during which the employees become unconditionally entitled to payment. The charge is recognised as an
employee expense, with a corresponding increase in liabilities. The fair value of the share option is measured based
on an option valuation model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted.
The liability is re-measured at each balance sheet date and at settlement date and any changes in fair value are
recognised in the income statement during the vesting period. These share based payment transactions are accounted
for as cash settled.

### F-154


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

**_Dividend distributions_**

Dividend distributions to the Company's shareholders are recognised as a liability in the Group's financial statements
in the period in which the dividends are approved by the Company's shareholders.

**_Contingent liabilities_**

The Group may, from time to time, be subject to legal proceedings. The Group records a liability in the financial
statements with respect to these matters when a loss is deemed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.
Where a liability is not probable or the amount cannot be reasonably estimated a liability is not recognised. However,
where a liability is possible and may be material, such matters are disclosed as contingent liabilities.

**2** **Segment reporting**

The Group is engaged in a single reportable operating segment of business, being the retailing of food, clothing, general
merchandise, fuel and services in a single geographical segment, the United Kingdom and online. The Group is not
reliant on any individual major customers.

In line with the Group's reporting framework and management structure, key operating decisions are made by the
Executive Board which is considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Group. All significant revenue
is generated by the sale of goods through retail outlets in the UK. The operations of all product areas of the business
are subject to similar economic characteristics and are sold in a similar retail environment.

The Group has taken these factors into account together with the core principals of IFRS 8 in determining that it has a
single reportable operating segment.

Included within the remuneration totals above are emoluments and short term benefits in respect of the following
directors, which are in respect of their services to the Broadstreet Great Wilson Europe Group (the ultimate parent
company for the UK) as a whole: R Burnley, S Clarke, A J Moore, A Murray, A Russo, H Tatum, A Hemmerdinger, A
Simpson and J Lorente Lopez. It is not possible to allocate their remuneration to individual companies within the Group.
Remuneration is impacted by timing of appointment and resignation of directors.

as a reduction in the Group's current tax charge for the year ended 31 December 2017 and an increase in intercompany
receivables. The re-allocation of group relief has had no impact on the total UK corporation tax paid during the year
by the Group on behalf of Broadstreet Great Wilson Europe Limited (see note 29) and its subsidiary undertakings.

The George brand has a carrying value of £17.3m (2016: £17.3m). The George brand is generating positive cash flows.
There are no plans to exit the brand and no legal limits on its use by the Group.
Other brand assets are fully amortised (£14.6m cost and accumulated amortisation).
Lease buy out costs represent amounts paid to third parties to enter a leasehold property. These costs are being
amortised over the term of the lease.
Software and development costs are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life of 4 years.
Other intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of 3 years.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

**_Reclassifications and transfers_**

During the year, assets relating to lease buy outs were reclassified from leasehold improvements to intangible assets
to better reflect the nature of these items. Assets transferred had a gross cost of £6.3m and accumulated depreciation
of £1.4m (see note 10).

During the prior year, assets relating to peppercorn leases were reclassified from intangible assets to freehold
properties to better reflect the nature of these items. Assets transferred had a gross cost of £25.1m and accumulated
depreciation of £nil (see note 10).

**Impairment testing of goodwill**

**_Netto Acquisition_**

Goodwill of £482.3m (2016: £482.3m) arose on the acquisition of Netto Foodstores Limited on 13 April 2011. This has
been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2017 by allocating costs directly attributable to Netto stores and a
reasonable allocation of central costs, to the chain of converted Netto stores along with other related assets. This
represents the lowest level to which management monitors goodwill.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from financial
budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period. This is the period to which specific reliable
forecasts have been made. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8.3% and the growth rate
used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the specific forecast period is 1.2%.

The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the assumptions of sales growth, gross margin, operating costs,
growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial forecast period, and the discount rate.

**Sales growth – sales expectations are initially formed based on management expectations of growth of small format**
stores for the foreseeable future. This takes into account historic data and current performance as well as future market
expectations from internal and external sources.

**Gross profit – Margin assumptions are formed based on management expectations of realistic future margin growth.**
These expectations are based on historic and current performance combined with internal and external factors
expected to affect gross profit margin in future years.

**Operating costs – some costs are directly attributable to individual stores. Other costs derive from central or shared**
costs for the whole Group and must be allocated to the chain on a reasonable basis. Operating cost forecasts for the
Netto chain reflect a combination of experience since acquisition and existing similar stores from 2011 to 2017
extrapolated as a proportion of sales, and known impacts to costs in future years

**Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial forecast period – long term growth rate forecasts**
are based on a combination of long term economic GDP growth forecasts for the UK and internal management growth
expectations.

**Discount rate – the pre-tax discount rate used in calculating the value in use represents an assessment of the rate of**
return a market participant would expect for an equally risky investment. This has been calculated by estimating the
weighted average costs of capital of other likely acquirers as well as that of the Group.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

With regard to the assessment of value in use, based upon calculations performed, management believe that no
reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying value of the chain of Netto
stores to exceed its recoverable amount.

**_Turkmen Tedarik Hizmetleri Acquisition_**

Goodwill of £17.0m (2016: £17.0m) arose on the acquisition of Turkmen Tedarik Hizmetleri on 26 April 2012. This has
been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2017 by assessing the present value of forecasted cash savings arising
from the synergies achieved as a result of the acquisition. Goodwill is allocated to a single cash generating unit, being
the acquired sourcing company.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cashflow projections from financial
budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the
cashflow projections is 8.3% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the cashflows beyond specific forecast period is
0.2%.

The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the assumptions of growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows
beyond the initial forecast period and the discount rate.

**Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial forecast period – long term growth rate forecasts**
are based on long term economic GDP growth forecasts for the UK.

**Discount rate – the pre-tax discount rate used in calculating the value in use represents an assessment of the rate of**
return a market participant would expect for an equally risky investment. This has been calculated by estimating the
weighted average costs of capital of other likely acquirers as well as that of the Group.

**Sensitivity to changes in assumptions**

With regard to the assessment of value in use, based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis undertaken,
management believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the carrying
value of the Turkmen goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount.

**Impairment testing of indefinite life intangibles**

**_George brand_**

This asset relates to the acquisition in 2006 of a perpetual licence to use the George brand and has a carrying value
of £17.3m (2016: £17.3m). This has been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2017 by assessing the present
value of forecasted cash flows arising from the George clothing business.

The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from financial
budgets approved by senior management covering a three-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash
flow projections is 8.3% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond specific forecast period is 0.5%.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

value of the George brand.

Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are generally on 30 day terms. Trade receivables are presented net
where a legally enforceable right or set off exists. Included in the above is an offset or £98.0m (note 16) (2016; £91.0m).
The gross trade receivable prior to the offset is £226.9m (2016: £226.2m).
As at 31 December 2017, trade receivables at nominal value of £3.9m (2016: £2.7m) were impaired and fully provided
for on the basis of the age of the debt and estimated ability of the customer to make payment. Movements in the

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

As at 31 December 2017, the analysis of trade receivables that were not impaired was as follows:
**Year Ended** **Year Ended**

_£m_
Neither past due nor impaired 119.4 124.7
More than 3 months past due 5.6 7.8
125.0 132.5


In determining the recoverability of trade receivables, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade
receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. Accordingly, the Directors believe that
there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. As at 31 December 2017,
trade receivables that were neither past due nor impaired related to a number of independent customers for whom
there is no history of default.
The allowance for doubtful debt assumes VAT in relation to the impaired balances will be fully recoverable.

The Group deals with over ten thousand separate suppliers and has established trading terms which are appropriate
to the particular relationship and product supplied. Whenever an order is placed the parties will be aware of the
payment terms and it is the Group's policy to abide by these terms when satisfactory invoices have been received.
Trade receivables are presented net where a legally enforceable right of set off exists. Included in the above is an offset
of £98.0m (note 14) (2016: £91.0m). The gross trade payable prior to the offset is £2,708.0m (2016: £2,494.8m).
The net reduction in intercompany payables of £262.8m includes the following transactions:
£400.0m settlement in cash of balance owed to a fellow subsidiary undertaking of the ultimate parent company
Non-cash increase in intercompany payables of £137.2m, mainly comprising interest accrued on amounts owed to the
immediate parent undertaking.

For terms and conditions relating to amounts owed to related parties, refer to note 28.

**17** **Financial instruments**

As at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, all borrowings were in Sterling at fixed rates of interest. The finance
lease obligations are carried at amortised cost, which is considered to approximate to fair value. The interest rate of
fixed rate debt is 5.448%-6.0% (2016: 5.448%-6.0%).

Amounts owed to fellow subsidiaries are disclosed in note 28. Details of obligations under finance leases are included
in note 24.

The increase in the year of £56.3m includes increases due to non-cash movements of £67.3m, partially offset by cash
payments of £11.0m.

**_Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities_**

The Group's principal financial instruments during the year comprised cash, cash equivalents, intercompany payables
and receivables and borrowings. Other financial assets and liabilities, such as trade receivables, trade payables, and
accruals arise directly from the Group's operating activities. The difference between the carrying value and the fair
value of the Group's financial instruments is not material.

The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial
instruments:

_Fixed rate borrowings – the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash_
flow using appropriate interest rates to net present value. All fixed rate borrowings are held with fellow subsidiaries of
the ultimate parent company.

_Derivatives –_ derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of forward contracts
entered into and are split between in the money (assets) and out of the money (liabilities). At 31 December 2017 the
Group held £nil (2016: £63.9m) in the money assets, and £29.4m (2016: £0.6m) out of the money liabilities in respect
of its forward contracts. During the year, the Group recognised assets on revaluation of hedged monetary assets and
liabilities from historical cost to year-end spot rate of £22.6m (2016: £11.4m liability).

The fair values of the Group's financial derivatives and fixed rate borrowings with fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate
parent company have been calculated at observable unquoted interest rates, and are categorised as Level 2 within the
fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement'. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted
prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

_Financial risk management_

The treasury function manages the Group's financial risk, considering its borrowings and exposure to foreign currency
fluctuations. The Group finances its operations through intercompany borrowings which were issued a number of years
ago and are wholly held within the Walmart group. The Group utilises its cash balances, and has access to bank
overdrafts, to satisfy short-term cash flow requirements. Foreign currency exposure is managed through entering into
forward currency contracts.

_Interest rate risk_

The Group's short term borrowings are all held with entities which are part of the Walmart group and are at fixed rates
of interest. Amounts owed to fellow subsidiaries (note 28) attract interest at a rate of 5.448% – 6% (2016: 5.448-6%).
As interest rates are fixed on all of the Group's debt, interest rate movements would not have an impact on profitability,
cash flow or equity.

The Group does not expect to take out borrowings with a variable interest rate in the foreseeable future.

_Foreign currency risk_

The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be affected
by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are managed
through the use of forward contracts.

The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31 December
2017, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward currency contracts
are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases. The terms of the forward currency hedging
contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a period of more than 12
months after the 31 December 2017. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income
statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss.

The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December
2017, a net unrealised loss of £21.0m (2016: £36.8m gain) was included in the hedging reserve in respect of hedging
contracts. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of these hedging
contracts was £57.8m (2016: £20.6m gain). This consists of £35.9m gains reclassified to income statement during the
year (2016: £26.2m), a £34.4m loss on not-yet-matured contracts during the year (2016: £50.8m gain), and a £12.5m
taxation credit (2016: £4.0m charge).

Under the Group's hedging policy, the only items for which forward currency contracts are in place are purchases of
goods for resale. Gains and losses attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised
as an expense within the Income Statement upon maturity of the forward contract.

As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure through the use of forward currency contracts, changes
in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short term profitability or cash flow. It is anticipated
that a 5% movement in the US dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management's assessment of a
reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in hedge equity of £42.1m (2016: £32.3m).

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**
_Credit risk_
There is no significant credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is
represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date. See note 14 for further information on trade
receivables and details of recoverability.
The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default by trade debtors including detailed credit checks
undertaken before a customer is accepted. Historically, these procedures have proved effective in minimising the level
of impaired and past due debtors.
Surplus cash is placed on short term deposit with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Group
treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit. Deposit limits and
approved financial institutions are dictated by the investment policy of the ultimate parent company.
_Liquidity risk_
The Group's treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring rolling
forecasts of the Group's cash flows. The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and
flexibility through the use of operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At 31 December 2017 the Group had no
external borrowings.
As at 31 December 2017, the Group held cash of £2,171.7m (2016: £1,862.7m), utilised along with overdrafts where
necessary, to secure short term flexibility. At 31 December 2017, the Group had uncommitted overdraft facilities of
£30.0m (2016: £30.0m), standby credit facilities, including bonds of £112.9m (2016: £125.7m), and uncommitted line
of credit facilities of £125.0m (2016: £125.0m).
The following table summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted
payments. The disclosed financial derivative instruments are the gross undiscounted cash flows. However, these

The Group operates a single trust based defined contribution pension plan for current colleagues. The assets of the
plan are held by the Legal & General Assurance Society Ltd and the Prudential Life Assurance Company.
The Group also operates two final salary defined benefit plans in the UK (one funded and one unfunded) which are
closed to future accrual. With effect from 12 February 2011, the link between past service benefits and future salary
increases was removed. The assets of the funded plan are placed by the trustees under the management of a number
of professional fund managers and are held separately from the Group's assets. The trustees invest in a range of
assets including bonds, equity securities and assets that will hedge movements in the liabilities. The trustees and Group
agreed a de-risking plan in 2011 whereby the proportion of plan assets invested in liability hedging assets will increase
over the period to 2021.

### F-170


-----

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

Responsibility for governance of the plans – including investment decisions and contribution schedules – lies with the
board of trustees. The trustee body of the defined benefit plan is made up of eleven trustees: five of these are member
nominated trustees including two pensioners, four are company appointed, and there are two professional independent
trustees. The trustee body of the defined contribution plan is made up of seven trustees: three of these are member
nominated, three are company appointed, and there is one professional independent trustee.
The Group's ultimate parent company Walmart Inc., guarantees the Group's obligations to the funded defined benefit
plan up to a maximum amount of £980m. This guarantee has no time limit.
A schedule of contributions is in place between the Group and trustees of the funded defined benefit plan in order to
pay down the deficit and the current schedule was agreed in 2017. A long term funding agreement was entered into
with the trustees in 2015 whereby contributions will continue until the scheme is fully funded on a self-sufficiency basis.
At the time of the April 2016 triennial valuation, this resulted in contributions of £70.0m per annum being paid into the
scheme until April 2032. Under IFRIC 14 this is considered to be a minimum funding requirement (also known as a
statutory funding objective). At the current year end, the plan is in surplus; however, contributions remain payable until
2024 in order to meet the statutory funding objective. As the plan rules do not provide the Group with an unconditional
right to a refund in the event of a surplus, under the requirements of IFRIC 14 the minimum funding requirement creates
an obligation which is recognised as an additional liability of £945.4m (2016: £791.5m).
The expected future benefit payments from the defined benefit plans are based on a number of assumptions including
future inflation, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and are therefore inherently uncertain.
Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than
assumed, or take a greater or lesser cash lump sum at retirement. The estimated duration of pension plan liabilities,
which is an indicator of the weighted average term of the liabilities, is 23 years (2016: 23 years) although the benefits
payable by the pension plans are expected to be paid over more than 80 years.

The defined benefit pension scheme expense is recognised in financial costs in the consolidated income statement.
The Group expects to contribute approximately £70.0m to its defined benefit scheme in the next financial year.
The Group operates one defined contribution pension plan. There were no unpaid contributions outstanding at the
current or prior year end for the defined contribution scheme. The charge for the year for the defined contribution
scheme is £61.9m (2016: £63.0m).

In order to mitigate the risk of volatility in the value of plan assets, a diverse portfolio of investments is held. This
includes an allocation to liability matching assets which mitigate the risk of volatility in the funding level. The majority of
these assets are bonds and arc included within debt securities in the table above. These liability matching assets
partially hedge the scheme's interest rate risk and inflation risk, as they move in line with change in interest rate and
future inflation expectations in a similar manner to the Scheme's liabilities. These risks are not fully hedged and the
interest rate risk is hedged on a long term funding basis (gilts) rather than AA corporate bonds basis. Other risks to the
scheme include longevity risk.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

_Principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages):_
**31 December** **31 December**
**2017** **2016**

_%_
Discount rate ........................................................................ 2.5 2.7
Inflation - RPI ....................................................................... 3.1 3.4
Inflation - CPI ....................................................................... 2.1 2.4
Future pension increases ..................................................... 3.0 3.3
The following table illustrates the residual life expectancy for an average member on reaching age 65, according to the
mortality assumptions used to calculate the pension liabilities:

**31 December** **31 December**
**2017** **2016**

Retiring at reporting date at age 65: ...................... Male 22.8 23.0
Female 24.7 25.0
Retiring in 25 years at age 65: .............................. Male 24.6 25.2
Female 26.5 27.4
_Sensitivity analysis of principal assumptions:_
The assumptions on the discount rate, inflation, and life expectancy all have a significant effect on the measurement
of the present value of the scheme liabilities. The following table provides an indication of the sensitivity of the IAS 19
pension liability at 31 December 2017, and of the income statement charge for 2018, to changes in these assumptions.
**Decrease / (increase)** **Decrease / (increase)**
**in liability** **in net finance costs**

£m
An increase of 0.1% to the following assumptions:
Discount rate ........................................................................ 54.3 1.5
Inflation rate (assuming RPI and CPI both move by 0.1
percent) ................................................................................ (53.6) (1.3)
One year increase in life expectancy ................................... (75.8) (1.8)


The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the
sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the
defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been
applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the statement of financial position. These sensitivities
exclude the impact of the onerous liability.

The methods and changes in assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis are the same as those used in the
previous period.

Share-based payment transactions are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 'Share-Based Payments'

The Group offers four share-based payment schemes to employees to enable them to own shares in the ultimate
parent company, Walmart Inc. The Group has the obligation to settle the liabilities for the schemes, including
employment taxes for participating employees, and therefore these schemes are accounted for as cash settled
liabilities.

The impact is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements of Walmart Inc. and the share options would not be
revalued if the Group were granting options on its own shares in a way consistent with UK public limited companies.
Two of these schemes involve the granting of options to employees to acquire shares in the ultimate

parent company at pre-determined exercise prices and two of the schemes involve the granting of rights to receive
shares in the ultimate parent company for nil consideration. The executive performance share plan has performance
conditions relating to the total payout of options issued, no other scheme has any performance conditions attached to
the scheme.

The total expenses recognised for the year arising from share based payments and the associated amounts recognised
in the balance sheet are as follows:

**31 December** **31 December**
**2017** **2016**

Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year. The average exercise price during the year to
31 December 2017 was £41.36 (2016: £42.30). The related shares arc denominated in US dollars being the reporting
currency of the ultimate parent company. The sterling exercise price of the Sharesave scheme options is fixed at the
exchange rate on issue, for all other schemes the exercise price is denominated in US dollars and the sterling equivalent
is translated based on the current exchange rate.

_Sharesave scheme_

The scheme has been in existence for employees since 1982 and gained HMRC approval in 2000. Employees with six
months* service are invited to join the scheme annually. Options arc granted annually to employees who elect to join,
and are exercisable in three or five years from date of grant, depending on the year of grant. Currently only three year
grants are being offered. The options under this scheme are treated as cash-settled. The exercise price of the options
granted is equal to the market price of the shares less 20% on the date of grant.

_Walmart Stock Incentive Plan (WSIP) scheme_

The scheme has been in existence since 1999. Options are granted to employees annually and are exercisable in five
or seven years from dale of grant, depending on the grant agreement. The options under this scheme are treated as

The fair value of the options outstanding under the WSIP scheme at 31 December 2017 is £0.7m (2016: £0.8m).

_Restricted Stock Rights (RSR) scheme_

The scheme was introduced in 2008 as an alternative to the WSIP scheme. Under the RSR scheme, employees are
awarded the right to receive a predetermined number of shares in the ultimate parent company three years from the
award date. All RSRs are classed as unapproved from an Income Tax and National Insurance perspective. RSR awards
are treated as cash-settled.

The number of share awards under the RSR scheme is as follows:

The fair value of the options outstanding under the RSR scheme at 31 December 2017 is £24.0m (2016: £ 19.5m).

_Performance Share Plan (PSP) scheme_

The Group offers a PSP scheme, for which conditions exist in relation to exercise as described below.

The scheme came into existence on 20 July 2006. Under the scheme, selected executives arc granted the right to
receive shares in Walmart Inc. provided certain pre-determined performance goals are met. These pre-determined
goals are in respect of sales growth and return on investment. All share awards under the PSP scheme have been
issued for nil consideration and have a contractual life of between 1 and 3 years. The share awards under this scheme
are treated as cash-settled.

Volatility is a measure of the amount by which a price is expected to fluctuate during the year. The Group has used
historical volatilities that correlate with the expected term of the options.
Share options are exercisable in US dollars and the risk free interest rate is based on the applicable US treasury rate.

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

The dilapidations provision represents provisions for the cost of repairs to leasehold properties at the end of their lease
term. These provisions are expected to crystallise at the end of the lease term of each property. During the year, the
Directors assessed the estimate of these liabilities and increased the provision by £27.1 m. This is accounted for within
additions as an increase in the cost of property, plant and equipment and the impact of this will be recognised as
additional depreciation over the lease terms of the sites to which the provision relates.

Certain properties have been revalued to their fair value prior to 1 January 2004. No provision has been made for
deferred tax on the temporary differences arising on revalued land and buildings. Historically upward revaluations have
been made in respect of land and not in respect of buildings. The tax base of land and buildings was adjusted to include
within it any rolled-over gains which might subsequently become chargeable on a future sale of relevant properties. It
has been calculated that sufficient indexation exists to produce a temporary difference of £nil on the whole portfolio of
assets such that no deferred tax recognition is required.

The Group has brought forward capital losses of £336.0m (2016: £348,0m) available to reduce future capital gains. No
deferred tax asset has been recognised on the accumulated capita) losses due to uncertainty of when they may be
utilised.

In January 2016, an exercise was performed to simplify the group structure through the restructuring of certain holding
companies. This included share capital reductions under section 641(1)(8) of the Companies Act 2006, the repayment,
transfer and recovery of intercompany debt, and the payment of dividends between group companies.

On 11 January 2016，the Company made a bonus issue of 2,440»000,000 ordinary shares at £0.25 per share,
increasing share capital (o £L393.9m. A share capital and share premium reduction or £1,958,3m was then enacted
under section 641(1)(a) of the Companies Act 2006, to reduce share capital to £1 and share premium to £nil.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one
vote per share at meetings of the Company,

The share premium account is used to record amounts received in excess of the nominal value of shares on issue of

**Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2017 (continued)**

**25** **Commitments**

As at 31 December 2017, the Group had not entered into any contract to purchase property, plant and equipment
(2016: £nil)

As at 31 December 2017, the Group had entered into contracts to purchase US dollars for £803.2m (2016; £703.5m)
and electricity for £42.0m (2016: £41.1m).

**26** **Contingent liabilities**

Equal Value Claims: ASDA Stores Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Group, is a Respondent to over 10t000
employment tribunal claims that have been presented on behalf of current and former ASDA store employees, who
allege that their work in ASDA's stores is of equal value in terms of the demands of their jobs to that of employees
working in ASDA's distribution centres, and that the differences in pay and terms and conditions between the different
jobs are not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the
distribution centres and those higher wage rales and more favourable terms and conditions on a prospective basis as
part of these equal value proceedings. ASDA believes that further claims may be presented. At present, the Directors
cannot predict the number of claims that may be presented, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss
that may arise from these proceedings. The Directors believe that there are substantial factual and legal defences to
these claims, and intend to defend the claims vigorously.

**27** **Acquisition of Nun-Controlling Interests**

On 4 January 2016, International Procurement Logistics Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, purchased 100% of the
share capital of Forza AW Limited and Kober Limited.

These entities were previously consolidated as non-controlling interests by the Group, per the conditions described in
the Accounting Policies on page 19.

The net assets of these entities attributable to their parent were recorded as non-controlling interests within equity.
Accordingly, the acquisition of these entities has been recorded as a reduction in non-controlling interests in the
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.

The fair value of equity interest held at the acquisition date was equal to the consideration paid (£55.3m).

No goodwill was recognised on acquisition of this equity interest as both entities have been previously treated as
subsidiaries and consolidated into the Group on the basis of having control over the entities. Therefore, no fair value
exercise was required on acquisition of the non-controlling interest.
