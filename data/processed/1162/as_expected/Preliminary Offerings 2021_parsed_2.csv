The 2017 Financial Statements, the 2018 Financial Statements and the 2019 Financial Statements have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, as set forth in their audit reports included elsewhere herein. Unless otherwise stated, no other financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum has been audited. The Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting as adopted by the European Union. The Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements do not include all notes of the type normally included in an annual financial report. The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the 2019 Financial Statements, except for the estimation of income tax expense, which has been recognised based on the estimate of the weighted average effective annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year, and the adoption of new and amended standards. This Offering Memorandum includes unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, which is calculated by adding the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 and subtracting the results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The financial information for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that may be expected for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 or any future period, and should not be used as the basis for or prediction of an annualised calculation. The unaudited financial information for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 has not been audited or reviewed by our auditors, is not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS or any other generally accepted accounting principles and has been prepared for illustrative purposes only. 1 ----- In this Offering Memorandum we present certain financial information related to periods prior to 2017. The financial information for periods prior to 2017 has been presented herein for illustrative purposes only and investors should place no reliance on such information. This Offering Memorandum does not include the audited financial statements for any period prior to 2017. There can be no assurance that, had such information been audited or reviewed, there would not have been any discrepancies (including material) compared to the financial information presented herein. The financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for periods prior to the year ended December 31, 2019 may not be comparable to financial information for later periods, due to changes that have occurred to IFRS that have occurred over time, in particular the significant changes caused by the adoption of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019 as described below. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgment in the process of applying our accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgment or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in the Financial Statements. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates.""_ In making an investment decision, you must rely upon your own examination of the terms of this Offering and the financial information contained in this Offering Memorandum. Prospective investors should consult their professional advisors for an understanding of: (i) the differences between IFRS, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (""U.S. GAAP""), UK GAAP and other systems of generally accepted accounting principles and how these differences might affect the financial information included in this Offering Memorandum, and (ii) the impact that future additions to, or amendments of IFRS principles may have on our results of operations and/or financial condition, as well as on the comparability of the prior periods. With respect to the 2019 Financial Statements, the Company applied the new IFRS 16 (Leases) accounting standard, effective from January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, as defined by the IFRS 16 accounting standard. The cumulative effects of applying this new accounting standard were therefore recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019 (the date of initial application), while comparative figures were not restated. Additionally, previous lease-related balances including operating lease prepayments, onerous lease provisions and straight-line rent accruals have been derecognised as part of the Company's adoption of IFRS 16. The 2017 Financial Statements and the 2018 Financial Statements have not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16 and thus cannot be directly compared to the 2019 Financial Statements, and the Company has not otherwise restated comparative amounts as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2018. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases for lessees and introduces a single lessee accounting model with some exemptions for short-term and low-value leases. The lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The effect of applying IFRS 16 is to align the presentation of leases more closely to that of owned assets, rent expense is no longer deducted in arriving at operating profit or EBITDA and instead profit before tax includes an interest charge on the unwinding of the lease liability and a depreciation charge on the right of use asset. As a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, right of use assets of £2,263.9 million and additional lease liabilities of £1,979.4 million were recognised as of January 1, 2019, and operating costs decreased by £31.4 million and finance costs increased by £52.7 million compared with lease-related expenses charged in the prior year under IAS 17. See note 1 (""Accounting Policies"") of the 2019 Financial Statements. For the avoidance of doubt, the historical financial information provided in this Offering Memorandum in relation to IFRS 16 does not reflect the potential impact of the Forecourt Assets Separation and the leases of the Select Retail Assets, the Substitute Retail Assets and the Distribution Assets. The financial information included in this Offering Memorandum is not intended to comply with the applicable accounting requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, which would apply if the Notes were being registered with the SEC. There could be significant differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP, as applied to the Company. We neither describe the differences between IFRS and U.S. GAAP nor reconcile the Company's IFRS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, such information is not available to investors, and investors should consider this in making their investment decision. The Indentures will impose no obligation on us to reconcile the Company's future financial statements prepared under IFRS to U.S. GAAP. See ""Independent Auditors"" for a description of the independent auditors' reports of Ernst & Young LLP. In accordance with guidance issued by The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, the independent auditors' reports from Ernst & Young LLP for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019, December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017 state that Ernst & Young LLP does not assume responsibility 2 ----- to anyone (including holders of Notes) other than the Company, as a body, for its audit work or the audit reports or opinions it has formed. Ernst & Young LLP has undertaken its audit work, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, to state to the Company's members those matters that it is required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. Investors in the Notes should understand that in making these statements, the independent auditors have confirmed that they do not accept or assume any liability to parties (such as the purchasers of the Notes) other than to the Company and its members, as a body, with respect to the report and to the independent auditors' audit work and opinions. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the U.S. Securities Act or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to such limiting language, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditor based on its report or the consolidated financial statements to which it relates could be limited.

1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2368,NOTICE TO AUSTRIAN INVESTORS,2368.6,Non-IFRS Financial Measures,2368.6.1,,"In this Offering Memorandum the Company presents certain financial measures that are not required by or presented in accordance with IFRS (the ""Non-IFRS Measures""). The Non-IFRS Measures included in this Offering Memorandum do not alone provide a sufficient basis to compare the ASDA Group's performance with that of other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an equivalent IFRS measure (if applicable) or any other generally accepted measure as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. Such non-IFRS financial information has not been audited or reviewed by Ernst & Young LLP. We believe that the presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures enhances an investor's understanding of our operating performance and our ability to service our debt. In addition, we believe that EBITDA is a measure commonly used by investors. The Company's Non-IFRS Measures may not be directly comparable with similarly titled measures used by other companies. The EBITDA Measures (as defined below) and related leverage and coverage ratios are not measurements of financial performance under IFRS and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS. You are encouraged to evaluate each of the adjustments reflected in the Company's presentation of the Non-IFRS Measures and whether you consider each to be appropriate. In addition, each of the Non-IFRS Measures may be defined differently from the definitions of corresponding or similar terms under the Indentures. The Company's NonIFRS Measures have important limitations as analytical tools. Some limitations of the Non-IFRS Measures include: 3 ----- - they do not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Company's debt; - they do not reflect any cash income and certain other taxes that the Company may be required to pay; - they are not adjusted for all cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Company's statements of cash flows; - they do not reflect the impact of earnings or charges resulting from certain matters the Company considers not to be indicative of its ongoing operations; - following the implementation of IFRS 16, they do not reflect any expense relating to leased assets classified as interest or depreciation; - in respect of Adjusted EBITDA, Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA and the other Non-IFRS Measures that reflect such measures, they reflect certain adjustments for anticipated cost savings, synergies and other estimates that may not be realised, whether in part or at all; and - they may not fully take into account the impact of COVID-19 on the Company's financial performance. Furthermore, you should carefully consider the risks and limitations of the Non-IFRS Measures, as they are based in part on assumptions made by the Company's management regarding the future impact of actions that have not yet been, and which may not in fact be, implemented. For example, there is a risk that the synergies we seek to achieve may not be realised in the anticipated time frame or at all and that the magnitude of cost savings may be significantly less than expected. Because of these limitations, our Non-IFRS Measures should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations, including in relation to the Notes offered hereby. You should compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on the ASDA Group's IFRS results and using these Non-IFRS Measures only in a supplemental manner to evaluate the ASDA Group's performance. Our primary Non-IFRS Measures are defined as follows: _EBITDA_ EBITDA, when used in this Offering Memorandum, is calculated by adding back to the Company's profit for the period income tax expense, finance income, finance costs and amortisation and depreciation. By eliminating potential differences in results of operations between periods caused by factors such as depreciation and amortisation, financing and capital structures and taxation positions or regimes, we believe EBITDA can provide a useful additional basis for comparing our operating performance with industry peers. _EBITDA Margin_ EBITDA Margin means the Company's EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue for the relevant period. _Adjusted EBITDA_ Adjusted EBITDA, when used in this Offering Memorandum, means the Company's EBITDA for a particular period as adjusted for certain historical costs, including impairment charges for both tangible, intangible and leased assets, asset write-offs, elimination of IFRS 16 impact, pension guarantees, share option costs and the removal of one-time items including ATM (""Automated Teller Machines"") tax rebates, one-off bonus payments, one-off contract implementation costs, estimated merger costs in relation to the proposed merger with Sainsburys, increased pension contributions as a result of changes in eligibility criteria and restructuring costs relating to significant restructuring programmes. 4 ----- _Adjusted EBITDA Margin_ Adjusted EBITDA Margin means the Company's Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of total revenue (including petrol) for the relevant period. _Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA, when used in this Offering Memorandum, means the Company's Adjusted_ EBITDA for a particular period as adjusted for the removal of Walmart royalties and IT costs and their replacement with new costs under the TSA with Walmart, other adjustments including the impact of the 2020 leap year and estimated costs relating to ASDA operating as a standalone group, one-off net impact of costs and benefits associated with COVID-19 and adjustment for certain anticipated cost savings, EG foodservice partnership synergies, synergies from the roll-out of the ASDA wholesale convenience business, the EBITDA associated with the Forecourt Assets and the Excluded Forecourts and the rent associated with the Warehouse Assets and Select Retail Assets. The Company believes that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA (collectively, the ""EBITDA Measures"") provide useful information to investors about its results of operations for the following reasons: (a) they are, or will be going forward, among the measures used by the Company's Board of Directors and management to evaluate the ASDA Group's underlying operating performance, review business trends, identify strategies to improve results and make day-to-day operating decisions, and (b) they allow a comparison of the Company's results across periods and results across companies in the industry in which the ASDA Group operates on a consistent basis, by removing the effects on the ASDA Group's operating performance of its capital structure (such as the varying levels of interest expense), asset base and capital investment cycle (such as depreciation and amortisation) and items largely outside the control of management (such as income taxes). None of the EBITDA Measures should be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of the ASDA Group's operating performance reported in accordance with IFRS. The EBITDA Measures have limitations as analytical tools, some of which are as follows: - the EBITDA Measures do not reflect the Group's cash expenditures or future requirements for capital investments or contractual commitments; - the EBITDA Measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, the Group's working capital needs; - none of the EBITDA Measures reflects the interest expense on the Group's debt or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on the Group's debt; - although depreciation and amortisation are non-cash charges, assets are depreciated or amortised over differing estimated useful lives and the assets being depreciated and amortised will often have to be replaced in the future, and the EBITDA Measures do not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements; - the EBITDA Measures exclude certain tax payments that may represent a reduction in cash available to the Group; - the EBITDA Measures are not adjusted for all non-cash income or expense items that are reflected in the Company's income statement; - other companies in the industry in which the Group operates may calculate their own EBITDA measures differently than the Company does, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures; - our calculation and presentation of the EBITDA Measures in this Offering Memorandum is similar to, but different from, the calculation of Consolidated EBITDA under the Indentures governing the Notes offered hereby or the agreements governing our Revolving Credit Facilities. In particular, EBITDA reflects the adoption of IFRS 16 by the Company effective January 1, 2019, while Adjusted EBITDA and Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA calculations under the Indentures may not. Accordingly the EBITDA Measures do not provide precise indications as to the level of our adherence to the terms of our Indentures and the agreements governing our Revolving Credit Facilities; and - certain adjustments made in calculating Adjusted EBITDA and _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA contain estimates that management believes reflect the underlying results of operations and are therefore subjective in nature and reflect certain adjustments for anticipated cost savings, synergies and other estimates that may not be realised, whether in part or at all. _Like-for-like sales growth (excluding petrol)_ Like-for-like sales growth (excluding petrol) is a measure of annual growth of sales (excluding VAT) 5 ----- calculated as comparable current year sales minus prior year sales for the current year comparable sales divided by prior year sales for the current year comparable sales. Current year comparable sales includes all revenue except petrol sales, sales generated from stores in the first twelve complete calendar months following grand opening, sales generated from stores that have permanently closed, sales generated from stores that have been temporarily closed for more than two consecutive complete calendar months within the previous twelve full calendar months, financial services commissions, toyou sales and George international franchise sales. _Free Cash Flow_ Free Cash Flow is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure. The ASDA Group uses Free Cash Flow as a liquidity measure to monitor cash flow generation. The Company presents Free Cash Flow because, in the Company's view, it provides investors with useful information about the Company's underlying ability to generate and extract cash flows from its various subsidiaries in order to make interest and principal payments on the Group's debt, including the Notes offered hereby. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of liquidity under IFRS and has limitations as an analytical tool, some of which are as follows: - it does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures by the ASDA Group, particularly because, in the case of pre-tax free cash flow, the ASDA Group's various tax payment obligations are not deducted from such measure; - it does not deduct cash flows used by the ASDA Group in financing activities; - it is not a direct measurement of cash flows and attempts to derive and measure the ASDA Group's ability to service debt from income statement data of the Company. Accordingly, it does not directly correlate to the actual collection of cash. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not take into account changes in working capital of the ASDA Group that are otherwise factored in when calculating its net cash from operating activities; - it does not deduct certain other items settled in cash; and - other companies in the industries in which the ASDA Group operates may calculate Free Cash Flow differently than it does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. _Cash Conversion_ Cash conversion is defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA. _Capital expenditure_ Capital expenditure is defined as the total cost of assets classified as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that the Company takes ownership of within a financial period (as opposed to the IFRS measurement of capital expenditure, which is based on cash flows). _Pro forma net debt Pro forma net debt consists of the Issuers' pro forma indebtedness in respect of the Notes, the Term_ Loan Facilities and leases, net of ASDA's estimated average cash and cash equivalents from January 4 to February 2, 2021 (inclusive), as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions on the Acquisition Completion Date. Pro forma net debt does not include any indebtedness in respect of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, which is expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the Warehouse Sale Transactions, or the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, which is expected to be repaid with the proceeds of the Forecourt Assets Disposal. See ""Capitalisation."" Our presentation and calculation of the ratio of _Pro forma_ net debt to _Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA is different from the calculation of Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio under the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement and is not indicative of our level of adherence to the terms of the Indentures or the Senior Facilities Agreement. See ""Description of the Senior Secured Notes,"" ""Description of the Senior Notes"" and ""Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements.""_ 6 ----- _Pro forma net senior secured debt Pro forma net senior secured debt consists of the Issuers'_ _pro forma indebtedness in respect of the_ Senior Secured Notes and the Term Loan Facilities, net of ASDA's estimated average cash and cash equivalents from January 4 to February 2, 2021 (inclusive), as adjusted to give _pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions on the Acquisition Completion Date. Pro forma net senior secured debt does not include any indebtedness in respect of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, which is expected to be repaid from the proceeds of the Warehouse Sale Transactions, or the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, which is expected to be repaid with the proceeds of the Forecourt Assets Disposal. See ""Capitalisation."" Our presentation and calculation of the ratio of Pro forma net senior secured debt to Pro _forma Adjusted EBITDA is different from the calculation of Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage_ Ratio under the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement and is not indicative of our level of adherence to the terms of the Indentures or the Senior Facilities Agreement. See ""Description of the Senior _Secured Notes"" and ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements."" Pro forma interest expense Pro forma interest expense reflects the blended interest expense associated with the Notes, Term Loan_ Facilities and our leases for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, as if the Transactions had occurred on October 1, 2019. Pro forma interest expense excludes charges related to allocated debt issuance costs, leases of Warehouse Assets or Select Retail Assets or other indebtedness.

While the Group accepts responsibility for the accurate extraction and reproduction of this market data, the Group has not independently verified such data and cannot guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Some of the information herein has also been extrapolated from market data, reports, surveys and studies using our experience and internal estimates. Elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, statements regarding the industry in which we operate and our position in this industry are based solely on our experience, internal studies, estimates and surveys, and our own investigation of market conditions. We believe that the sources of such information in this Offering Memorandum are reliable, but there can be no assurance that any of these assumptions is accurate or correctly reflects our position in our industry, and none of our internal surveys or information has been verified by any independent sources. Further, the data and statistical information in this Offering Memorandum may differ from information provided by our competitors or from information found in current or future studies conducted by market research institutes, consultancy firms or independent sources. While the Group is not aware of any misstatements regarding any industry or similar data presented herein, such data involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various factors, including those discussed under the ""Risk Factors"" section in this Offering Memorandum.

All the information set forth in this Offering Memorandum relating to the industry and markets in which the Company operates has been obtained from independent research, unless otherwise indicated. Neither the Issuers nor any of the Initial Purchasers have independently verified this information and cannot guarantee its accuracy. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected the industry and markets in which we operate.

Accordingly, the industry publications, reports, surveys or studies from third-party data providers to which this Offering Memorandum refers, even if and where updated to reflect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including relating to market evolution and market share estimates may not, in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, accurately reflect the current or expected market conditions, trends and growth rates. As the COVID-19 impact is ongoing, even such industry publications, reports, surveys or studies from third-party data providers to which this Offering Memorandum refers and which purport to reflect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, as applicable, are inherently incomplete as to the full effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Brokers' Opinions of Pricing are strictly confidential and provided only for the purposes of the Transaction and providing an indication of pricing for the benefit of the Issuers in connection with the preparation of this Offering Memorandum (the ""Original Purposes""). Newsteer and Colliers have accepted no responsibility whatsoever to any third party for any part of the contents of the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing and as such no third party may rely upon the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing. Prospective investors should be aware that the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing were prepared as of October 20, 2020 and are not as of the date of this Offering Memorandum. Neither Newsteer nor Colliers has been requested to update or revise any of the information contained in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing as of any later date or the date of this Offering Memorandum, nor will they be asked to do so prior to the issuance of the Notes or at any later date. Accordingly, the information included in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing may not reflect the current physical, economic, competitive, market or other conditions with respect to the Group Property Portfolio. Commercial property is generally bought and sold by reference to its security of income generation, development potential, future rent generation or potential for capital growth. Any events that have a material impact on a property's ability to trade or the development of the immediate vicinity can consequently have a significant effect on pricing, more so than other property types. Examples of such events are: - macroeconomic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere; - an economic downturn, including as a result of COVID-19; - potential changes to the competitive landscape for grocery retail; - capital expenditure requirements; - changes in occupier and investor demand; - supply and demand generally affecting pricing; - adaptability or obsolescence; - regulation (e.g. minimum energy efficiency standards); - changes in consumer behaviour and shopping habits, either from gradual changes over time or as a result of any other event listed above or under ""Risk Factors"" in this Offering Memorandum; and - other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum. The foregoing factors and others described under ""Risk Factors"" should not be construed as exhaustive. Due to such uncertainties and risks, readers are cautioned not to place reliance on the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing. Pricings change over time and an opinion of pricing given on a particular date may not be valid on an earlier or later date, when both market conditions and sale circumstances may be different as a result of which we may not be able to realise such pricing upon a disposal. As neither Newsteer, Colliers nor any other external real estate adviser has been requested to update or revise the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing or prepare new opinions of pricing of the ASDA Property Portfolio for any date after October 20, 2020, if an opinion of pricing of the ASDA Property Portfolio was conducted today there can be no assurance that it would not be materially different from the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing. As a result, the information contained in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing may no longer reflect the characteristics of the property portfolio as of the date of this Offering Memorandum or any date thereafter. Prospective investors should be aware that the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing have been issued on the basis that they can only be relied upon by the Issuers for the Original Purposes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,364,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE NAMES,364.5,Basis of Brokers' Opinions of Pricing,364.5.1,,"The Brokers' Opinions of Pricing of the relevant properties have been prepared on the basis of existing use of such properties, as supermarkets, offices or distribution warehouses. The opinions of pricing do not reflect any alternative use, intensification or development of use of these properties. In order to conduct its opinion of pricing, both Newsteer and Colliers relied on floor areas of the relevant properties as provided by ASDA and Newsteer and Colliers have assumed that these floor areas have been defined in compliance with the RICS Measurement Standards. For the purposes of its opinion of 18 ----- pricing, Colliers also relies on floor areas for certain of the properties that were measured by its rating department under a separate instruction from ASDA, which comply with the current edition of RICS Measurement Standards. Both Brokers' Opinions' of Pricing have been produced on a desktop basis only without visual inspection of the properties and without undertaking the typical due diligence that would normally be entered into by a purchaser. See ""—Terms and Assumptions"" and ""—Methodology"" for further assumptions providing the basis of the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,364,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE NAMES,364.6,Terms and Assumptions,364.6.1,,"The opinions of pricing of all properties were based on their existing use of the properties. Newsteer and Colliers made various assumptions as to tenure, letting, taxation, town planning, and the condition and repair of buildings and sites—including, among other things, ground conditions and contamination. If any of the information or assumptions on which the studies are based are subsequently found to be incorrect, the opinions of pricing may also be incorrect and should be reconsidered. In particular, in preparation of their respective broker's opinion of pricing, Newsteer and Colliers assumed each property to be the authorised use under planning legislation and in accordance with the use registered with the relevant regulatory agency. During the course of their engagement, Newsteer and Colliers did not perform site inspections, environmental audit, tests of services and amenities, investigations or tests as to the condition of the properties. Newsteer and Colliers did not make planning or permitting enquiries and did not examine deeds, leases or other documents in respect of tenure or title to the ASDA Group's properties, building structure and condition, planning, environmental or other statutory information. The Brokers' Opinions of Pricing assumed, among others, that as at October 20, 2020 (i) in the case of Newsteer, the properties are let to ASL and in the case of Colliers, the properties are let to ASDA or to a AAA-tenant, which could include ASDA, and in both cases that ASDA are in the market for all the properties and benefits from an excellent rating, such as AAA and a very low risk of failure, (ii) all properties are freehold or long leasehold and all title, tenure, lettings, planning, taxation, statutory and local authority requirements are complied with and all properties possess a good and marketable title free from any onerous restrictions or conditions, (iii) all properties benefit from full access and egress rights together with sufficient parking and loading facilities and are connected to all main services, (iv) all properties are free from defect, in good repair and condition and well maintained and in marketable condition, compliant with all building, accessibility and fire safety regulations and there are no abnormalities as to repair and condition of the properties, (v) the properties have no environmental issues such as contamination, deleterious materials, flooding, ground conditions, invasive or protected plants or species and the properties are not adversely affected by any existing or proposed environmental law, (vi) the floor areas provided to Newsteer and Colliers by ASDA comply with the RICS Standards for measurement (other than those properties which were measured by Colliers as part of separate instruction and which comply with the edition of the RICS Measurement Standards current as at the date of this Offering Memorandum and upon which Colliers have relied for the purposes of their opinion on pricing) and (vii) no capital expenditure is required in respect of the properties. Both Colliers and Newsteer have assumed that each property is a vacant shell unit which benefits from fully capped off services and no tenant fit-outs or fixtures and fittings beyond a typical specification with which a vacant shell unit would be let or sold have been taken into account in the respective broker's opinion of pricing.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,364,TRADE MARKS AND TRADE NAMES,364.7,Methodology,364.7.1,,"The Brokers' Opinions of Pricing have been prepared on the basis of ""capital pricing"" and have been arrived at using comparable transactional evidence of leasing and sales transactions, adjusted to reflect the characteristics of the properties in the ASDA Property Portfolio. Capital pricing as determined by Newsteer and Colliers is based on certain qualifications and assumptions (including as to market participants (e.g., that there is a willing lessor and willing lessee, as well as a willing vendor and purchaser, in terms of demand for the properties in the open market, liens or other encumbrances, and the condition and repair of buildings and sites, including environmental matters), estimates and projections. In both cases, Newsteer and Colliers have assumed that the properties are fully leased at market rates as of October 20, 2020. Newsteer has also assumed that the properties are open for business and trading as of October 20, 2020 and are trading at sufficient levels that warrant the opinion of pricing. Colliers has determined capital pricing by assuming an ""all-risks"" yield to the annual rent assumed under a rental price exercise. The rental price exercise applies an overall rental price per square foot based on the gross internal floor area of each building. The yield assumes that any occupier would have an institutional-grade covenant similar to the leading grocery operators or other national or international logistics firms, which could include ASDA. The rent and yield approach is cross-checked with a capital price per square foot analysis that uses comparable transactional evidence. Benchmarks were drawn from recent 19 ----- transactions of similar properties in similar locations in the marketplace and a certain rent and yield range was then applied depending on the characteristics of the properties and their locations. The yield range applied varies from approximately 4.5% to 9.5% depending on the characteristics of the properties and their locations. For each property, it is assumed that the property is subject to an occupational lease as of October 20, 2020 on the following terms: (a) 20-year term to a AAA-rated tenant, (b) yearly indexation of the rent based on Retail Price Index with 1% / 3% collar and cap, (c) no open market rent review, (d) full repairing and insuring lease terms, (e) on institutional terms which are acceptable to landlords and tenants typical of the properties, and (f) the lease has the benefit of security of tenure pursuant to the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954. Colliers has not deducted any void costs nor any non-recoverable costs but assumes a deduction of standard purchaser's costs applicable to property assets in determining capital pricing of the ASDA Distribution Sites Portfolio. Newsteer has determined capital pricing in the case of freehold properties by applying an estimated net initial yield in perpetuity to the annual rent assumed under a rental price exercise for the freehold properties. For long leasehold properties, Newsteer has applied an estimated term yield for the remaining term to the profit rent assumed under a rental price exercise having disregarded any rent review provisions for the long leasehold properties. In each case, the yield assumes that the occupier would have an institutional-grade covenant similar to the leading grocery operators. Benchmarks were drawn from recent transactions of similar properties in similar locations in the marketplace. The rental price exercise applies an overall rental price per square foot based on the gross internal floor area of each store and the net internal floor area of each office. For each store property that benefits from a petrol filling station, Newsteer has reflected the existence of a petrol filling station with an addition of 5% to the base shell rental pricing for the stores. For each property, it is assumed that the property is subject to an occupational lease on the following terms: (a) 20-year term to an institutional-grade tenant, (b) five yearly upwards only open market rent reviews on a shell basis with appropriate rent-free incentives, (c) on institutional terms which are acceptable to landlords and tenants typical of the properties and (d) assuming that ASL is in occupation and that ASDA would have bid competitively for the properties at the time of letting and paid the market rent assessment. Newsteer has not deducted any voids nor any non-recoverable costs and has not deducted standard purchaser's costs, thereby reporting on a gross capital pricing basis. We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the capital pricing of the ASDA Group's properties are correct, accurate or complete. For example, if the properties were assumed to be held with vacant possession, rather than being assumed to be occupied, the capital pricing would be materially lower. Any opinions or conclusions reached in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing depend upon these assumptions, estimates and projections, some or all of which may or may not occur or prove to be relevant. In addition, the methodologies and assumptions used in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing may differ from those underlying our projections and estimates contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. The foregoing are brokers' opinions of pricing as set forth in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing and are distinct from the book value recorded on the ASDA's statement of financial position in respect of the Group's properties in the ""Property, plant and equipment"" and ""Investment properties"" line items on the statement of financial position of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements. The Brokers' Opinions of Pricing have not been prepared in accordance with IAS 16 ""Property, Plant and Equipment"" or IAS 40 ""Investment Property,"" which are the accounting principles applicable to the ASDA Group's property and investment properties.

We operate a significant store estate of 614 stores (excluding standalone PFSs) that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom. We also have the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). The graph below compares our total grocery market share with that of other major UK grocery retailers. (Source: Kantar. Based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020. *Ocado Market share shown.) We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household expenditure on food and beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through economic fluctuations. Groceries are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic. See also ""Industry."" One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is in turn centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to ""Every Day Low Price"" and our wholly-owned supplier, IPL, which enables us to take a vertically-integrated approach to procurement and which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and well-established George Clothing and George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers and our team of flexible and engaged colleagues. Historically, we have benefited from the support of Walmart, our former parent company. We will continue to receive support from Walmart over the next three years pursuant to the Transitional Agreements negotiated in connection with the Acquisition. For more information about the ongoing support to be provided by Walmart, please see ""Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions— _Transitional Agreements with Walmart"" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart.""_ ### 23 ----- We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue was approximately £22.9 billion (including petrol), of which approximately £2 billion was online sales, and our Adjusted EBITDA was approximately £1.2 billion (including petrol). The chart below presents the breakdown of our 2019 revenue by product category (food, general merchandise, clothing and petrol), food category (ambient and fresh and produce) and channel (stores and online (including George.com)). (Source: ASDA information. Year ended December 31, 2019. Note: Does not include £61 million of other revenue.) Our differentiated operating model has resulted in strong financial performance: our successful financial profile is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure) and cash conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. In 2018 and 2019, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.5% (including petrol), our cumulative free cash flow was approximately £1.7 billion and our average cash conversion was approximately 70%. The charts below show our EBITDA Margins, Adjusted EBITDA Margins, Unadjusted Cash Conversion (""Unadjusted Cash Conversion"" is calculated as Unadjusted Free Cash Flow divided by EBITDA) and Unadjusted Free Cash Flow (""Unadjusted Free Cash Flow"" is calculated as EBITDA less capital expenditure) for the years ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2019 and our cash conversion and free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. (Source: ASDA information.) ### 24 ----- (Source: ASDA information.) We believe that our business, operating model and financial performance also benefit from our significant freehold real estate asset portfolio. See ""Brokers' Opinions of Pricing."" We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we maintain a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom. Within the UK value market, we have strong market shares across ambient products (13.0%), fresh/chilled (11.6%) and total grocery (12.2%) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). Our offer is strong across the full food basket: our category market shares range from 12% to 14% (except household and toiletries) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). We believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal ASDA data, our prices are approximately 6% to 7.5% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on a 2020 year-to-date (weeks 1-42) average, based on total goods price gap percentage). Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is supplemented by a large clothing and general merchandise business. We offer our entire range of food and non-food products to customers as a convenient ""one-stop shop"" experience that is supported and enhanced by our strong online offer. We believe our omni-channel offer, through which we reach customers at our brick-and-mortar stores, through our significant online offering and on our app, appeals to our customers. In 2020, there were approximately 9.8 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended February 28, 2020), and approximately 723,000 weekly orders post COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended September 30, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has increased use of and engagement with our online platforms and we currently fulfil approximately 720,000 online orders per week. Our online grocery business operates from 350 stores, we offer at-home delivery and customers are also able to collect their purchases at one of approximately 460 ASDA Click & Collect sites. We are also expanding our 1-hour Click & Collect offer. Our business model integrates our store-based and online offer by leveraging our stores to fulfil online orders. ### 25 ----- Our online grocery business is profitable and has been consistently gaining market share within one of the world's most developed online grocery markets. We have consistently outperformed the UK online grocery market and increased our online market share in the last three years. According to Kantar, we currently operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, holding 18.2% of market share (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) as of December 2019, which grew to 19.8% as of December 27, 2020 (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales), representing a 1.5% gain and the second-strongest share gain since December 2019 amongst our key competitors. The chart below shows the evolution of our market share as compared with our key competitors for the periods presented. See also ""Industry."" (Source: Kantar.

Our online business is already of significant scale: the chart below shows the growth of our online sales, including a breakdown of online grocery versus George.com sales, for the periods presented. (Source: ASDA information.) According to Kantar, we are the second-largest online clothing retailer overall by volume in the United Kingdom and we held 6.0% of the total UK online clothing (excluding essentials, footwear and accessories) market by volume for the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020. Combined sales for our online grocery business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion (of which £1.5 billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £1.9 billion in 2019 (of which £1.6 billion were online grocery sales and £0.3 billion were George.com sales) to a total of £2.7 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 (of which £2.4 billion were online grocery sales and £0.3 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR of 26% between 2018 and September 30, 2020. Additionally, our toyou service allows customers to conveniently collect and return orders from George.com and other partner retailers at our stores. We have partnered with 119 brands and process more than 10 million parcels per year. With our team of approximately 140,000 flexible and engaged colleagues serving approximately 15 million customers each week (based on the average of weeks 39 to 42 of 2020), we are committed to and deeply invested in the UK food supply chain. Our business model is supported by diversification. First, we are a mass market retailer that serves the entire UK population, in terms of both customer demographics and geography, with our customer base ### 26 ----- skewing slightly towards value-seeking families, younger shoppers and lower-income customers who are attracted by our Every Day Low Price strategy and with strong market shares in the North of England, Scotland and Wales.

We will continue to operate the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets pursuant to the ASDA Leases which will be put in place in accordance with the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.

See ""Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with Walmart"" and ""Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart."" In addition to the Transitional Agreements, we have also agreed with Walmart to set up_ separation planning working groups to ensure a smooth transition. Our ongoing relationship with Walmart is expected to bring a number of benefits, in particular: ## • Information and technology support to facilitate the change from the Walmart ecosystem; • Deep research and development expertise and capabilities; • Global sourcing, leveraging Walmart's sourcing capabilities in clothing and general merchandise; • Best practices, leveraging Walmart's expertise and experience as a leading global retailer; and • Long-term support and continued partnership with Walmart's management and leadership.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

During the COVID-19 pandemic, customer behaviour has changed, with a shift away from out-of-home food consumption towards at-home food consumption, to the benefit of the UK grocery market. The chart below shows COVID-19-accelerated channel shifts over the periods presented. For further information on prevailing trends in the UK grocery retail market and, in particular, the recent channel shifts which have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, please see ""Industry."" (Source: Kantar Worldpanel, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a year-to-date basis ended December 27, 2020.) Grocery sales have grown by 12.3% between December 1, 2019 and December 27, 2020, according to Kantar, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales. Changes to consumer behaviour that have positively benefitted the grocery market during the COVID-19 pandemic include: increased consumption of food at home, a shift to online shopping channels, increased preference for shopping locally, in particular during the first UK lockdown (which we believe benefitted retail groups with a strong convenience store presence), and an increased focus on food safety, hygiene and health. Despite significant challenges posed by COVID-19, our business has remained resilient, supported by a well-developed online channel, which saw significant growth during government-imposed lockdowns as customer behaviour evolved. We were able to quickly increase the capacity of our online offer in response to increased demand driven by the pandemic, gaining market share and improving the profitability of our online business. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have benefitted from healthy revenue growth driven by higher food sales volumes (which were in turn driven by stockpiling and increased customer demand for in-home groceries via the online grocery channel), while margins contracted due to adverse changes in sales and product mix resulting from decreases in clothing sales, which impacted the George Clothing brand, the temporary closure of 33 ASDA Living stores and the shift in product mix within the food category away from higher-margin categories, such as food-to-go, and towards lower-margin categories, such as beer, wine and spirits and meat, which factors were partially offset by lower levels of promotional activity and stronger general merchandise sales. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product categories generally have higher margins than our food product categories. Profitability was also adversely impacted by COVID-19-related increases in operating costs, such as the increase in retail colleague wage costs (driven by bonus payments, overtime wages and wages paid colleagues absent from work due to COVID19, as well as wages paid to colleagues who worked during such sick colleagues' absences, rather than as a result of increased wage rates), increased costs incurred in connection with goodwill compensation paid to clothing suppliers, holiday markdowns, enhanced cleaning and related health and safety measures, as well as higher retail operating expenditures. We have considered the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event: the 207 ----- impact on future results and cash flows is difficult to estimate and we have therefore considered a range of scenarios as described in note 1 (""Accounting Policies"") of the 2019 Financial Statements. See ""Risk _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—The impact of COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to create uncertainty in our market and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control.""_ We took significant steps during the first twelve weeks of the first lockdown period in the spring of 2020 to protect our most vulnerable colleagues, asking them to remain home on contracted pay in order to ensure their safety, while we increased social-distancing and protective measures at our stores. When we welcomed these colleagues back, we carried out individual risk assessments and conducted socialdistancing training for them. In September 2020, we further tightened our safety measures across our stores to provide an enhanced level of protection to our customers and colleagues, introducing new door marshals at the front of stores and increasing security presence in the aisles of larger stores; marshals also provide sanitised baskets to customers as they enter stores. Colleagues continue to be on hand to help customers with safety queries and reiterate government guidelines to wear a face covering and maintain social distancing while they shop. Customers who do not have a face covering when they enter the store are offered a pack of disposable masks that they can pay for as they complete their shopping. Additional hand sanitisation stations are in place in the busiest sections of all stores in addition to the multiple cleaning points already found throughout stores. Should current safety guidelines continue, we believe that it is unlikely that we will continue to incur a significant portion of the additional costs in the future that we incurred in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic during the first two lockdowns, as many of these costs incurred were one-off in nature. The chart below shows the COVID-19 impacts for ASDA on a year-to-date basis as of September 30, 2020. (1) ""GNFR"" refers to goods not for resale. (Source: ASDA information.) In March 2020, as part of a number of measures to support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government, the Scottish government and the devolved administrations for Wales and Northern Ireland announced full relief for rates charges applicable to certain eligible commercial properties for the rates year beginning in April 2020 (and in the case of Northern Ireland, such support ended after July 2020). This relief applied to a number of properties owned or leased by the Group and as such, no rates charge has been recognised in these accounts for the period to which this relief applied. On December 3, 2020, we publicly announced that we would voluntarily pay business rates for the April 2020/21 year on the properties to which the relief applied. As rates relief was in place at September 30, 2020, no liability existed at that date and as such, our directors have concluded that the announcement on December 3, 2020 is a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event per the guidance set out in IAS 10. Discussions with the relevant local authorities relating to the timing of payment are ongoing. 208 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,1177,HISTORY,1177.1,The Transactions,1177.1.1,The Acquisition and Acquisition Agreement,"On October 2, 2020, the Issa Brothers and TDR Capital (the ""Shareholders"") caused their jointly controlled entity, Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited (the ""Purchaser""), to enter into the Acquisition Agreement with the Seller, a subsidiary of Walmart, pursuant to which the Purchaser committed to acquire all of the issued ordinary shares of the Company on the Acquisition Completion Date (the ""Acquisition""). The Purchaser, a limited company formed under the laws of Jersey, is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary ### 33 ----- of the Issuers. It was formed by the Shareholders solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement and has not commenced any operations, other than as set forth in the Acquisition Agreement. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the consideration payable by the Purchaser on the Acquisition Completion Date will be £6,614.0 million (assuming an Acquisition Completion Date of February 16, 2021) (the ""Purchase Consideration""). Under the terms of the Acquisition Agreement, the Seller was required to use commercially reasonable endeavours to cause the Company to make distributions to the Seller or other Walmart Group Companies of at least £1,769.5 million prior to the Acquisition Completion Date. On December 21, 2020, the Company approved a distribution of £1,769.5 million to ASDA Holdings UK Limited, of which £1,269.5 million was a distribution in specie through the transfer of intercompany receivables and £500.0 million was settled in cash. On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Company will settle outstanding intercompany payables due by the ASDA Group to Walmart Group Companies in cash. The Acquisition Agreement includes customary warranties by the Seller and the Purchaser. The Seller and the Purchaser have also separately agreed on a dedicated indemnification regime applicable to any losses arising from the Equal Value Claims. As contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition will be completed following receipt of the FCA's approval, but during the pendency of the review of the Acquisition by the CMA, which is the competition authority that has the authority to review the Acquisition following referral by the European Commission. The CMA's review is ongoing. Currently, the CMA is conducting its phase 1 inquiry into the Acquisition. If the CMA identifies competition-related concerns over the course of this phase 1 inquiry, we intend to propose remedies to address these concerns, which may include the sale of certain PFS sites to unaffiliated third parties. See ""—The Post-Completion _Transactions—Forecourt Disposals."" However, there can be no assurance that any remedies we may_ propose will be acceptable to the CMA. If the remedies we may propose are rejected, the CMA Clearance Date could be significantly delayed and more extensive remedies may be required from us, which could potentially include a mandated sale of the ASDA Group. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the _Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes.""_ In connection with the CMA's review of the Acquisition, we expect the CMA to issue an IEO shortly before or immediately after Completion, which we expect to remain in force until the CMA Clearance Date. Under this IEO, the Bellis Group will not be permitted to exercise de facto control over the ASDA Group or otherwise direct its operations until the CMA Clearance Date. As a result, although we acquired the ASDA Group on the Acquisition Completion Date, we will not effectively control the ASDA Group until the CMA Clearance Date. Furthermore, while the IEO is in effect, it will prevent us from making any significant structural or organisational changes to the ASDA Group, including the Forecourt Business Disposal, the Excluded Forecourt Divestments or any other Post-Completion Transactions, unless we seek and obtain a derogation from the CMA. Accordingly, we do not intend to initiate these post-completion transactions until the CMA Clearance Date.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

In this case, we expect to fund our payment of the Purchase Consideration on the Acquisition Completion Date using the Equity Contribution (including Walmart's Rollover Equity Investment) and amounts drawn under the Senior Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the Senior Bridge Facility and the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities (the ""Initial Financing"") and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. On the Issue Date, we will then use the proceeds from the Offering to repay a portion of the Initial Financing, including all amounts drawn under the Senior Bridge Facility and the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities (together with the Initial Financing and the other related transactions described in this section of the Offering Memorandum, the ""Financing""). See ""Use of Proceeds."" _Utilisations of Senior Bridge Facility_ On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Notes Issuer expects to draw the full amount of the Senior Bridge Facility under the Senior Bridge Facility Agreement and to on-lend the amounts received to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan. See ""Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements.""_ ### 34 ----- _Utilisations of Senior Facilities, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility_ On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer expects to draw the full amount of the Term Loan Facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will on-lend the net proceeds from these drawings along with funds received from the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan to the Purchaser, to be used as described in ""Use of Proceeds."" See ""Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements."" Utilisation of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility_ On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower expects to draw £950 million under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, which will be on-lent by way of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Proceeds Loan to Midco 2. Midco 2 and its subsidiaries, in turn, will on-lend the net proceeds of the drawing to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to a deeply subordinated instrument, to be used as described in ""Use of Proceeds."" See ""Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements—Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility."" To secure the Distribution Asset_ Disposal Bridge Facility, certain entities within the ASDA Group will grant first priority mortgages, fixed charges or standard securities, as applicable, over the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent required thereunder, certain Substitute Retail Assets, as well as first-ranking pledges on the Designated Bank Accounts. Prior to the execution of these mortgages, fixed charges, standard securities and pledges, as applicable, entities within the ASDA Group are expected to enter into lease agreements in respect of the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets on substantially the terms summarised in ""Certain Relationships and Related Party _Transactions―ASDA Leases."" The Equity Contribution_ In connection with the Acquisition, the Shareholders and Walmart will cause Bellis TopCo Limited and its subsidiaries to contribute to the equity of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or on-lend to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to deeply subordinated instruments approximately £1,280 million in aggregate (the ""Equity Contribution""), which includes the proceeds of Walmart's £500 million Rollover Equity Investment and £780 million of funds raised by the Shareholders. _The Offering and the repayment of the bridge loans_ On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering of the Senior Notes to repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Bridge Facility Agreement, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will use the proceeds from the Offering of the Senior Secured Notes to repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities Agreement. See ""Use of Proceeds."" _Estimated cash and cash equivalents as of the Acquisition Completion Date_ On or about the Acquisition Completion Date, ASDA will settle in cash intercompany loans owed to Walmart of £409.0 million. In addition, on December 3, 2020, the Company announced that it will pay in full its business rates for the UK tax year ending April 5, 2021 to the UK government (and the devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland), thus waiving the relief it had received earlier in 2020 in respect of such payment as part of the UK government's measures in support of UK businesses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This is estimated to be within a range of £320 million to £340 million. As a result, the Company expects to pay £254 million in retrospective business rates for the period from April to December 2020, to be funded from cash available on the Company's balance sheet. The Company expects to engage in due course with the competent UK authorities to discuss and agree the exact terms of such payment, including its timing. ASDA also plans to resume its regular payments of the business rates on a monthly basis commencing with the month of January 2021. The Company estimates that its average cash and cash equivalents from January 4 to February 2, 2021 (inclusive), as adjusted to give pro forma effect to the consummation of the Transactions on the Acquisition Completion Date and excluding the amount earmarked to retrospectively pay business rates tax relief accepted from the UK government for the period to December 31, 2020 was £505.6 million. ASDA's net working capital for the month of January tends to be slightly lower than the yearly average due to the customary seasonal dip in stock levels and the build-up of trade payables to suppliers in the early part of each financial year following the Christmas trading period. ASDA's actual cash and cash equivalents available as of the Acquisition Completion Date may however be different. ### 35 ----- _The Financing in the event that the Issue Date occurs prior to, or substantially concurrently with, the Acquisition Completion Date_ It is possible that the Acquisition Completion Date may be delayed until after the Issue Date, including due to the timing of our receipt of the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. In this case, unless the Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the closing of the Acquisition, we will, pending completion of the Acquisition, fund the gross proceeds of the Offering into Escrow Accounts, which will be held in the name of the relevant Issuer, but controlled by the relevant Escrow Agent, and pledged in favour of the relevant Trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of the holders of the relevant Notes, pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreements and Escrow Account Charges dated on or before the Issue Date. Under the terms of the Escrow Agreements, release of the Escrowed Proceeds will be subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including the completion of the Acquisition and the solvency of the relevant Issuer. Following release from escrow, we expect to use the proceeds of the Offering, together with the Equity Contribution and amounts drawn under the Senior Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility (as described above and in ""Use of Proceeds."") to fund our payment of the Purchase Consideration on the Acquisition Completion Date. In the event we deposit the gross proceeds of the Offering into the Escrow Accounts on the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date has not occurred, or the conditions to the release of such Escrowed Proceeds have not been satisfied, on or before the Outside Date, Midco has not elected to extend the initial Shortfall Agreement Termination Date (or any extension thereof) and the Release has not occurred as at such date or in certain other circumstances, subject to certain conditions, the Notes will be mandatorily redeemable at a price equal to 100% of the aggregate issue price of the Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest from the Issue Date to, but not including, the Special Mandatory Redemption Date and Additional Amounts, if any. If the Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, we will forgo these escrow procedures and will instead retain the proceeds of the Offering to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement on the Acquisition Completion Date.

After the Retail Assets Contributions have been made, we expect to distribute any remaining Post-Completion Disposal Receivables to Topco, in the amounts that remain outstanding at the time, by way of dividends in kind and anticipate that Topco would then arrange for such receivables to be extinguished by contribution to Propco 2. Subject to certain limitations, the Post-Completion Disposals and the in-kind distribution of the Post-Completion Receivables will be permitted by the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement notwithstanding the restrictive covenants or other terms that would otherwise apply to such transactions. Moreover, these distributions will not constitute Restricted Payments under the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement and will not reduce the Issuers' capacity to make distributions or pay dividends in the future. See ""Description of _the Senior Secured Notes—General—Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries; Extraction of_ ### 38 ----- _Warehouse Assets and Select Retail Assets"" and ""Description of the Senior Notes—General—Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries; Extraction of Warehouse Assets and Select Retail Assets.""_ In connection with sale transactions entered into by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, we may be required to amend the terms of the ASDA Leases. Such amendments will be permitted under the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement, subject to compliance with the covenants described in ""Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Affiliate Transactions"" and ""Description of the Senior Notes—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions."" Forecourt Disposals_ On February 3, 2021, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and Bellis Forecourts Limited entered into the Forecourt SPA, whereby the Senior Secured Notes Issuer undertook to sell to Bellis Forecourts Limited the share capital of Acquisition 2 or any other member of the Bellis Group or a member of the ASDA Group that holds the Forecourt Business, directly or indirectly, following the Acquisition Completion Date, the CMA Clearance Date and completion of the acquisition by Acquisition 2 (or such other company) of the Forecourt Business. Pursuant to a separate agreement, the EG Forecourt SPA, entered into on or about the same date, Property Newco agreed to sell to Euro Garages Limited the share capital of Holdco (owning in turn Bellis Forecourts Limited and therefore the Forecourt Business) promptly upon closing under the Forecourt SPA. Property Newco may assign such separate agreement to the shareholders (i.e., Optima Group S.à r.l. and Able Holdings Limited), who may sell Property Newco itself, rather than Holdco or one of its subsidiaries. In preparation for, and prior to, the closing of the Forecourt SPA, we expect that ASDA will distribute the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as soon as practicable following the CMA Clearance Date. In order to effect the distribution of the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as a dividend in kind, ASDA will have to arrange for the separation of the freehold or leasehold title to its co-located forecourts (comprising the vast majority of the Forecourt Assets) from the parent title currently comprising adjacent store or retail assets or sites by way of a Forecourt Assets Separation and the entities within the ASDA Group that currently hold non-co-located Forecourt Assets will need to distribute such assets to Acquisition 2. We expect that the process of effecting these title separations and distributions to take several months following the Acquisition Completion Date. The headline enterprise value established under the Forecourt SPA, subject to customary working capital adjustments, is £750 million, less the aggregate value of any Excluded Forecourts (and of any other assets relating to the Excluded Forecourts). The consideration will be left outstanding at the closing of the Forecourt SPA (the ""Forecourt Disposal Receivable"") and we expect it to be ultimately settled in cash and in full promptly following the closing of the EG Forecourt SPA. See ""Certain Relationships and Related _Party Transactions—Forecourt SPA."" The parties may decide to novate and assign the Forecourt SPA to_ another member of the Bellis Group or a member of the ASDA Group (as seller) and to a member of the EG Group (as buyer), in which case the separate agreement between Property Newco and Euro Garages Limited would be terminated and the Forecourt Business (or a holding company thereof) would be sold directly to EG Group by the ASDA Group. The IEO that is expected to be issued by the CMA will not permit us to sell any Forecourt Assets pursuant to the Forecourt SPA for so long as the IEO remains in force. Consequently, we do not expect to consummate the Forecourt Business Disposal before the CMA Clearance Date. The Forecourt SPA requires us to complete the transactions contemplated thereunder as soon as reasonably practicable following the satisfaction of the conditions precedent stipulated in its terms, which include the IEO to be issued by the CMA ceasing to be in effect. The CMA's investigation of the Acquisition is ongoing, and we may be required to take remedial action to address any competition-related concerns the CMA may identify. If remedies prove necessary, we may be required to designate certain Forecourt Assets (along with certain related assets) as Excluded Forecourts and sell them to unaffiliated third parties (the ""Excluded Forecourt Divestments""). Although we will attempt to carry out the Excluded Forecourt Divestments by way of orderly sales following a competitive sales process, there can be no assurance that the market conditions or circumstances of the Excluded Forecourt Divestments will permit such an outcome, and the price we receive for any Excluded Forecourts sold through the Excluded Forecourt Divestments may be less than what we would have ultimately received in a fully voluntary sale. In addition, third parties may have rights over the Forecourt Assets (including rights to acquire and pre-emption rights) exercisable in the event of a transfer of the Forecourt Assets (whether of the freehold or leasehold interest or of whole or part). In all such cases, the transfer of those Forecourt Assets may be significantly delayed, prevented in part or prevented entirely. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties _and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes.""_ ### 39 ----- Under the terms of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the proceeds from the sale of both the Forecourt Business Disposal and the Excluded Forecourt Divestment must be used to repay amounts outstanding under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility until it has been repaid in full.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, customer behaviour has changed, with a shift away from out-of-home food consumption towards at-home food consumption, to the benefit of the UK grocery market. The chart below shows COVID-19-accelerated channel shifts over the periods presented. For further information on prevailing trends in the UK grocery retail market and, in particular, the recent channel shifts which have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, please see ""Industry."" (Source: Kantar Worldpanel, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a year-to-date basis ended December 27, 2020.) Grocery sales have grown by 12.3% between December 1, 2019 and December 27, 2020, according to Kantar, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales. Changes to consumer behaviour that have positively benefitted the grocery market during the COVID-19 pandemic include: increased consumption of food at home, a shift to online shopping channels, increased preference for shopping locally, in particular during the first UK lockdown (which we believe benefitted retail groups with a strong convenience store presence), and an increased focus on food safety, hygiene and health. Despite significant challenges posed by COVID-19, our business has remained resilient, supported by a well-developed online channel, which saw significant growth during government-imposed lockdowns as customer behaviour evolved. We were able to quickly increase the capacity of our online offer in response to increased demand driven by the pandemic, gaining market share and improving the profitability of our online business. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have benefitted from healthy revenue growth driven by higher food sales volumes (which were in turn driven by stockpiling and increased customer demand for in-home groceries via the online grocery channel), while margins contracted due to adverse changes in sales and product mix resulting from decreases in clothing sales, which impacted the George Clothing brand, the temporary closure of 33 ASDA Living stores and the shift in product mix within the food category away from higher-margin categories, such as food-to-go, and towards lower-margin categories, such as beer, wine and spirits and meat, which factors were partially offset by lower levels of promotional activity and stronger general merchandise sales. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product categories generally have higher margins than our food product categories. Profitability was also adversely impacted by COVID-19-related increases in operating costs, such as the increase in retail colleague wage costs (driven by bonus payments, overtime wages and wages paid colleagues absent from work due to COVID-19, as well as wages paid to colleagues who worked during such sick colleagues' absences, rather than as a result of increased wage rates), increased costs incurred in connection with goodwill compensation paid to clothing suppliers, holiday markdowns, enhanced cleaning and related health and safety measures, as well as higher retail operating expenditures. We have considered the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event: the impact on future results and cash flows is difficult to estimate and we have therefore considered a range of scenarios as described in note 1 (""Accounting Policies"") of the 2019 Financial Statements. See ""Risk ### 44 ----- _Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—The impact of COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to create uncertainty in our market and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control.""_ We took significant steps during the first twelve weeks of the first lockdown period in the spring of 2020 to protect our most vulnerable colleagues, asking them to remain home on contracted pay in order to ensure their safety, while we increased social-distancing and protective measures at our stores. When we welcomed these colleagues back, we carried out individual risk assessments and conducted socialdistancing training for them. In September 2020, we further tightened our safety measures across our stores to provide an enhanced level of protection to our customers and colleagues, introducing new door marshals at the front of stores and increasing security presence in the aisles of larger stores; marshals also provide sanitised baskets to customers as they enter stores. Colleagues continue to be on hand to help customers with safety queries and reiterate government guidelines to wear a face covering and maintain social distancing while they shop. Customers who do not have a face covering when they enter the store are offered a pack of disposable masks that they can pay for as they complete their shopping. Additional hand sanitisation stations are in place in the busiest sections of all stores in addition to the multiple cleaning points already found throughout stores. Should current safety guidelines continue, we believe that it is unlikely that we will continue to incur a significant portion of the additional costs in the future that we incurred in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic during the first two lockdowns, as many of these costs incurred were one-off in nature. The chart below shows the COVID-19 impacts for ASDA on a year-to-date basis as of September 30, 2020. (1) ""GNFR"" refers to goods not for resale. (Source: ASDA information.) In March 2020, as part of a number of measures to support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government, the Scottish government and the devolved administrations for Wales and Northern Ireland announced full relief for rates charges applicable to certain eligible commercial properties for the rates year beginning in April 2020 (and in the case of Northern Ireland, such support ended after July 2020). This relief applied to a number of properties owned or leased by the Group and as such, no rates charge has been recognised in these accounts for the period to which this relief applied. On December 3, 2020, we publicly announced that we would voluntarily pay business rates for the April 2020/21 year on the properties to which the relief applied. As rates relief was in place at September 30, 2020, no liability existed at that date and as such, our directors have concluded that the announcement on December 3, 2020 is a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event per the guidance set out in IAS 10. Discussions with the relevant local authorities relating to the timing of payment are ongoing. ### 45 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

We have built our business on listening to our diverse range of customers, offering what they need at the best value and bringing innovation to the UK market. ### 32 ----- We were founded in 1965 through the merger of the Asquith family grocery business with the Associated Dairies company in Yorkshire. Our name is derived from this historic merger, combining ""Asquith"" and ""Dairies"" to form ""ASDA."" Founded in the North of England, we have a rich history, heritage and culture. The Asquith family has deep ties to the grocery business, W.R. Asquith having run a butchers shop in Knottingly, West Yorkshire, which eventually expanded to seven shops. W.R. Asquith's sons, Peter and Fred, went on to create the United Kingdom's first self-service supermarket in Castleford, introducing food discounting to the UK grocery market, and eventually co-founded ASDA. In parallel to the growth of the Asquith family business, a group of West Riding dairy farmers joined forces, eventually becoming Associated Dairies & Farm Stores Limited led by Arthur Stockdale. Arthur's son, Sir Noel Stockdale, went on to co-found ASDA with Peter and Fred Asquith. In 1965, we acquired GEM, a major U.S. discount retailer operating in the United Kingdom. With the addition of general merchandise to the former GEM stores, we introduced the superstore to the UK market, a landmark event in the development of UK retailing. To complement this offer, Peter Asquith also introduced the first discounted petrol filling station. By 1970, we operated over 30 stores and were poised to expand beyond our original home in the North of England. Throughout the 1970s, we grew our presence in the South of England, opening stores in Newport, Plymouth and Gosport. In 1977, we launched our ""ASDA Price"" TV adverts, featuring the ""pocket tap"" which came to be the official sign language for ASDA. By the end of the 1970s, we were operating over 80 stores and opened our 100th store in 1981. Throughout the 1980s, we focused on expanding our distribution capabilities, opening seven new distribution centres strategically located throughout the United Kingdom by 1985. In 1987, our flagship Watford store opened, another landmark in UK retailing, and featured the longest-ever checkout bank at the time, with 45 checkouts. In 1988, we opened our headquarters in Leeds, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher overseeing the opening ceremonies. In 1989, George Davies was asked to produce a line of clothing for us that was high-quality, high-value and had its own identity: the pioneering George brand was born. In the 1990s, we developed the ASDA Way of Working, an innovative framework for a new organisational structure that focuses on our stores and promotes colleague involvement, which set the stage for the ASDA culture of today. In 1996, we opened our first ASDA Pharmacy location in Harrogate, North Yorkshire and launched our ""Tickled Pink"" campaign to raise money for the fight against breast cancer, a partnership that continues to this day. In 1998, we began our online retail operations with a dedicated depot in Croydon. In 1999, we joined the Walmart family, becoming part of the world's largest retailer. Throughout the early 2000s, we continued to grow and innovate, expanding our online and Click & Collect offers, opening our first ASDA Living store and our first Eco Store, winning awards for the value we offer customers as well as for the positive environment we create for colleagues, launching our Free From and Extra Special offers, launching standalone PFSs as well as ASDA Opticians. In 2015, we celebrated our 50th birthday and George's 25th birthday. In 2016, Roger Burnley joined our team as Chief Operating Officer and Deputy Chief Executive and was promoted in 2018 to President and CEO. ASDA has continued to roll out innovations, including the United Kingdom's first parcel tower, which allows customers to collect online orders in less than 60 seconds, and voice-activated shopping through Google Home.

The Asquith family has deep ties to the grocery business, W.R. Asquith having run a butchers shop in Knottingly, West Yorkshire, which eventually expanded to seven shops. W.R. Asquith's sons, Peter and Fred, went on to create the United Kingdom's first self-service supermarket in Castleford, introducing food discounting to the UK grocery market, and eventually co-founded ASDA. In parallel to the growth of the Asquith family business, a group of West Riding dairy farmers joined forces, eventually becoming Associated Dairies & Farm Stores Limited led by Arthur Stockdale. Arthur's son, Sir Noel Stockdale, went on to co-found ASDA with Peter and Fred Asquith. In 1965, we acquired GEM, a major U.S. discount retailer operating in the United Kingdom. With the addition of general merchandise to the former GEM stores, we introduced the superstore to the UK market, a landmark event in the development of UK retailing. To complement this offer, Peter Asquith also introduced the first discounted petrol filling station. By 1970, we operated over 30 stores and were poised to expand beyond our original home in the North of England. Throughout the 1970s, we grew our presence in the South of England, opening stores in Newport, Plymouth and Gosport. In 1977, we launched our ""ASDA Price"" TV adverts, featuring the ""pocket 200 ----- tap"" which came to be the official sign language for ASDA. By the end of the 1970s, we were operating over 80 stores and opened our 100th store in 1981. Throughout the 1980s, we focused on expanding our distribution capabilities, opening seven new distribution centres strategically located throughout the United Kingdom by 1985. In 1987, our flagship Watford store opened, another landmark in UK retailing, and featured the longest-ever checkout bank at the time, with 45 checkouts. In 1988, we opened our headquarters in Leeds, with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher overseeing the opening ceremonies. In 1989, George Davies was asked to produce a line of clothing for us that was high-quality, high-value and had its own identity: the pioneering George brand was born. In the 1990s, we developed the ASDA Way of Working, an innovative framework for a new organisational structure that focuses on our stores and promotes colleague involvement, which set the stage for the ASDA culture of today. In 1996, we opened our first ASDA Pharmacy location in Harrogate, North Yorkshire and launched our ""Tickled Pink"" campaign to raise money for the fight against breast cancer, a partnership that continues to this day. In 1998, we began our online retail operations with a dedicated depot in Croydon. In 1999, we joined the Walmart family, becoming part of the world's largest retailer. Throughout the early 2000s, we continued to grow and innovate, expanding our online and Click & Collect offers, opening our first ASDA Living store and our first Eco Store, winning awards for the value we offer customers as well as for the positive environment we create for colleagues, launching our Free From and Extra Special offers, launching standalone PFSs as well as ASDA Opticians. In 2015, we celebrated our 50th birthday and George's 25th birthday. In 2016, Roger Burnley joined our team as Chief Operating Officer and Deputy Chief Executive and was promoted in 2018 to President and CEO. ASDA has continued to roll out innovations, including the United Kingdom's first parcel tower, which allows customers to collect online orders in less than 60 seconds, and voice-activated shopping through Google Home. Our values are rooted in service to our customers, respect for the individual, striving for excellence and acting with integrity. We pursue our values with the support of our colleagues, culture and technology.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

See ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility."" Midco 2 and its subsidiaries, in turn, will on-lend such net proceeds to the Issuers through deeply subordinated instruments. ----- On or about the Acquisition Completion Date, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into the ASDA Leases in respect of the Warehouse and Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets. Following the execution of the ASDA Leases, entities in the ASDA Group owning the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets will grant first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities by way of third-party security over such assets, to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility (the ""Third-Party Asset Security""). Certain thirdparty consents, approvals or certifications may remain outstanding in relation to the grant of an ASDA Lease or the grant of Third-Party Asset Security in respect of one or more Affected Warehouse Assets or, in each case, the registration of any such ASDA Lease or Third-Party Asset Security. As a result, the entities in the ASDA Group owning the Affected Warehouse Assets may not be able to grant or register an ASDA Lease or grant or register Third-Party Asset Security in respect of such Affected Warehouse Assets on the Acquisition Completion Date. If not, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into ASDA Leases in respect of one of more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the aggregate value of the Affected Warehouse Assets and will grant Third-Party Asset Security over each of the relevant Substitute Retail Assets to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. See ""The Transactions—The Post-Completion Transactions—Warehouse and Other Select Retail _Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.""_ In addition to the Third-Party Asset Security, each entity in the ASDA Group owning Warehouse Assets (or, to the extent applicable, certain Substitute Retail Assets), subject to an ASDA Lease will grant third-party security over its Designated Bank Accounts into which the rental income derived from the ASDA Leases in respect of the Warehouse Assets or Substitute Retail Assets is to be paid, to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. The security interests created by the security over the Designated Bank Accounts and the Third-Party Asset Security exclusively benefit the creditors and other secured parties under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes, and the Notes Guarantees in respect thereof, will be effectively subordinated to indebtedness under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility to the extent of the value of the Warehouse Assets and the Select Retail Assets (and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the Substitute Retail Assets depending on the value of any Affected Warehouse Assets) and of the value of the monies standing to the credit of each Designated Bank Account. (4) Topco 2 and Property Newco are shareholders of Bellis Holdco Limited (""Holdco""). Topco 2's shareholding consists entirely of class A shares, and Property Newco's shareholding consists entirely of class B shares. (5) We are offering £500.0 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes. If we settle the Offering after the Acquisition Completion Date, we will draw the Term Loan Facilities, Senior Bridge Facility, Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility to fund a portion of the consideration payable for the Acquisition on the Acquisition Completion Date and will repay a portion of the drawings under the Senior Bridge Facility with the proceeds of the Senior Notes on the Issue Date. If the Acquisition Completion Date is delayed until after the Issue Date, unless the Offering is consummated substantially concurrently with the Acquisition, we will fund the gross proceeds of the Senior Notes into an Escrow Account, which will be held in the name of the Senior Notes Issuer, but controlled by the relevant Escrow Agent, and pledged in favour of the Senior Notes Trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Escrow Agreement and Escrow Account Charge dated on or before the Issue Date. In that case, on or about the Acquisition Completion Date, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, the Escrowed Proceeds will be released from escrow and utilised to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement. If the Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, we will forgo the escrow procedures and will instead retain the proceeds of the Senior Notes to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement on the Acquisition Completion Date. See ""Use of Proceeds"" and ""Description of the Senior Notes—Acquisition _Agreement, Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds.""_ On the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be general senior obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date the Senior Notes will be guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, ASDA Group Limited and ASL (the ""Initial ASDA Guarantors"") on a senior subordinated basis as set forth under ""Description of the Senior Notes—General—Notes Guarantees"" and will be secured by the Senior Notes Collateral (including the Shared Security) on the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date as set forth under ""Description of the Senior Notes—Security."" The Shared Security will also secure the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's obligations in respect of its Senior Notes Guarantees on a second-priority basis. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed within 90 days of the Acquisition Completion Date, by McLagan Investments Limited and The Burwood House Group Limited (the ""Post-Completion Guarantors"" and, together with the Initial ASDA Guarantors, the ""ASDA Guarantors,"" and, together with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the ""Senior Notes",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

(6) On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will on-lend the proceeds of the Senior Bridge Facility or the Senior Notes, as applicable, to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer pursuant to the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan, and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will then transfer these funds to the Purchaser by way of back-to-back equity contributions or intercompany loans through the intermediate subsidiaries to pay a portion of the Purchase Consideration on the Acquisition Completion Date. (7) We are offering £2,250 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes. If we settle the Offering after the Acquisition Completion Date, we will draw the Term Loan Facilities, Senior Bridge Facility, Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility to fund a portion of the consideration payable for the Acquisition on the Acquisition Completion Date and will repay the drawings under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities and part of the drawings under the Senior Bridge Facility and Facility B with the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date. If the Acquisition Completion Date is delayed until after the Issue Date, unless the Offering is consummated substantially concurrently with the Acquisition, we will fund the gross proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes into an Escrow Account, which will be held in the name of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, but controlled by the relevant Escrow Agent, and pledged in favour of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee on behalf of and for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, pursuant to the terms of the relevant Escrow Agreement and Escrow Account Charge dated on or before the Issue Date.

If the Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, we will forgo the escrow procedures and will instead retain the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement on the Acquisition Completion Date. See ""Use of Proceeds"" and ""Description of the Senior Secured _Notes—Acquisition Agreement, Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds.""_ On the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be general senior obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, on the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Initial ASDA Guarantors and will be secured by the Senior Secured Notes Initial Collateral as set forth under ""Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Security."" The Senior Secured Notes Initial Collateral will also secure the obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement (including the Revolving Credit Facilities) and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility on an equal and ratable basis with the Senior Secured Notes. Within 90 days of the Acquisition Completion Date or, in the case of security over the ASDA Guarantors' Material Real Property, 180 days, the Senior Secured Notes will also be secured by the Senior Secured Notes Post-Completion Collateral. Additionally, the Senior Secured Notes Collateral may also secure, on an equal and ratable, or in certain circumstances super senior, basis with the Senior Secured Notes, certain hedging obligations and certain other indebtedness permitted to be incurred and secured on the Collateral in the future. See ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement."" Subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed on a senior basis within 90 days of the Acquisition Completion Date by the Post-Completion Guarantors. (8) The Senior Facilities Agreement will initially provide for committed facilities of up to £2,275 million (equivalent), comprised of the £1,585 million Term Loan Facilities and the £690 million Revolving Credit Facilities. If we settle the Offering after the Acquisition Completion Date, a portion of the initial drawings under Facility B under the Senior Facilities Agreement will be repaid with the proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes. The Senior Facilities Agreement is expected to be amended and restated either prior to or shortly following the Acquisition Completion Date to make certain changes, including making Facility B an all euro-denominated facility (the ""Amended SFA""). The initial borrower under the Senior Facilities Agreement is the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and, on the Acquisition Completion Date, the Company and ASDA Stores Limited will each accede to the Senior Facilities Agreement as an additional guarantor and, in the case of ASDA Stores Limited, as an additional borrower. On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Term Loan Facilities made available pursuant to the Senior Facilities Agreement will be utilised in full by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the proceeds thereof contributed to the Purchaser by way of back-to-back equity contributions or intercompany loans through intermediate subsidiaries. Subject to certain limitations, other subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, including the other ASDA Guarantors, may become borrowers under the Senior Facilities Agreement in the future. See ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Senior _Facilities Agreement"" and ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement."" Subject to_ compliance with the terms of the Indentures, the commitments made available under the Senior Facilities Agreement may be increased in the future. (9) On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will draw £750 million under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and will transfer these funds to Acquisition 2 by way of equity contribution. Acquisition 2 will then contribute these funds to the Purchaser's equity, and the Purchaser will use these funds to pay a portion of the Purchase Consideration on the Acquisition Completion Date. See ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Forecourt Disposal Bridge _Facility.""_ (10) On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Purchaser will fund the payment of the Purchase Consideration with amounts indirectly received from the Equity Contribution and drawings under the Term Loan Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and the Senior Bridge Facility and Senior Bridge Facilities or, if the Issue Date occurs prior to or substantially concurrently with the completion of the Acquisition, the proceeds of the Offering. See ""Use of Proceeds."" Upon consummation of the Acquisition, the Company will become a wholly-owned direct subsidiary of the Purchaser. Following completion of the Acquisition, our ability to direct the business of and exercise de facto control over the Company and its subsidiaries will be subject to the terms of the CMA's initial enforcement order (the ""IEO"") until the CMA Clearance Date. Moreover, the CMA may require the Shareholders to take certain actions to address competition-related concerns, including divestment of certain PFS sites. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain _uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes.""_ (11) On the later of the Issue Date and the Acquisition Completion Date, the Senior Notes will be guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Initial ASDA Guarantors and the Senior Secured Notes will be guaranteed by the Initial ASDA Guarantors. Within 90 days of the Acquisition Completion Date, the Post-Completion Guarantors will be required to provide Notes Guarantees in respect of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes as described in ""Description of the Senior _Secured Notes—General—Notes Guarantees"" and ""Description of the Senior Notes—General—Notes Guarantees,""_ respectively. As of October 20, 2020, the ASDA Guarantors held title to sites representing 99.9% of the aggregate capital pricing of the ASDA Store and Office Portfolio, as described in ""Brokers' Opinions of Pricing."" For the nine month period ended September 30, 2020, the ASDA Guarantors represented 99.9% of the ASDA Group's consolidated revenue. Each Guarantee will be subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, including the Agreed Security Principles, and certain contractual and legal limitations. See ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement"" and ""Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on the Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the _Security Interests."" By virtue of these limitations, a Guarantor's obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less_ than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. ### 49 ----- ### The following chart illustrates the Group's expected simplified corporate structure and principal indebtedness after giving pro forma effect to the Post-Completion Transactions and the use of proceeds therefrom, following the CMA Clearance Date. For a summary of the debt obligations referred to in this chart, see ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements,"" ""Description of the Senior Secured Notes"" and ""Description of the Senior Notes."" (1) On February 3, 2021, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and Bellis Forecourts Limited entered into the Forecourt SPA, whereby the Senior Secured Notes Issuer undertook to sell the share capital of Acquisition 2 or any other subsidiary holding the Forecourt Business, directly or indirectly, to Bellis Forecourts Limited following the Acquisition Completion Date, the CMA Clearance Date and the acquisition of the Forecourt Business by Acquisition 2 or such other subsidiary. Pursuant to a separate agreement entered into on the same date, Property Newco agreed to sell to Euro Garages Limited (a member of the EG Group) the share capital of Holdco (which will in turn own Acquisition 2 and therefore the Forecourt Business) or any other entity holding, directly or indirectly, the Forecourt Business promptly upon closing under the Forecourt SPA. Property Newco may assign such separate agreement to the shareholders (i.e., Optima Group S.à r.l. and Able Holdings Limited), who may sell Property Newco itself, rather than Holdco or one of its subsidiaries. In preparation for, and prior to, closing under the Forecourt SPA, we expect that ASDA will distribute the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as soon as practicable following the CMA Clearance Date. In order to effect the distribution of the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as a dividend in kind, ASDA will have to arrange for the separation of the freehold or leasehold title to its co-located forecourts (comprising the vast majority of the Forecourt Assets) from the parent title currently comprising adjacent store or retail assets or sites. The entities within the ASDA Group that currently hold Forecourt Assets will then distribute such assets to Acquisition 2. We ### 50 ----- expect the process of effecting these title separations and distributions to take several months following the Acquisition Completion Date. The headline enterprise value established under the Forecourt SPA, subject to customary working capital adjustments, is £750 million, less the aggregate value of the Excluded Forecourts (and of any other assets relating to the Excluded Forecourts). The consideration will be left outstanding at the closing of the Forecourt SPA (the ""Forecourt Disposal",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,10,SUMMARY CORPORATE AND FINANCING STRUCTURE,10.3,"Receivable"") and we expect it to be settled in cash and in full promptly following the closing of the subsequent sale of Holdco",10.3.1,,"or Property Newco pursuant to the separate agreement between Property Newco and Euro Garages Limited. See ""Certain _Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Forecourt SPA.""_ Following closing under the Forecourt SPA, assuming no novation and assignment thereof, Bellis Topco Sub Limited will acquire Midco from Holdco. The consideration for the transfer from Holdco will be the cancellation of Topco 2's class A shares in Holdco. In connection with this transfer, Bellis Topco Sub Limited will issue additional shares to Topco 2. Following this reorganisation (i) Bellis Topco Sub Limited will become the direct parent of Midco and an indirect parent of Midco 2, the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Purchaser and the ASDA Group, (ii) Property Newco will be the sole shareholder in Holdco and (iii) Holdco's only direct subsidiary will be Bellis Forecourts Limited, which will be the direct parent of Acquisition 2. Holdco or Property Newco will then be acquired by EG Group and the Forecourt Disposal Receivable will be settled in cash, with the Senior Secured Notes Issuer being required under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement to use the proceeds of such payment to repay all or a portion of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility. As an alternative to the foregoing steps, the parties may decide to novate and assign the Forecourt SPA to the Company or one of its subsidiaries (as seller) and/or to a member of the EG Group (as buyer), in which case the separate agreement between Property Newco and Euro Garages Limited would be terminated and the Forecourt Business (or a holding company thereof) would be sold directly to EG Group by the ASDA Group. The proceeds of such sale would be applied following receipt by the ASDA Group to repay all or a portion of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility. The transfer of the Forecourt Assets and the implementation of the Forecourt Business Disposal entail certain risks, and there can be no assurance we will be able to consummate these transactions as described herein or at all. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—We _may not be able to consummate the Post-Completion Transactions as quickly as we anticipate, or at all, and the manner in which we execute the Post-Completion Transactions may differ from what we present in this Offering Memorandum.""_ (2) Following the CMA Clearance Date, ASDA will transfer the Warehouse Assets, the balances credited to the Designated Bank Accounts, and, to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement, some or all of the Substitute Retail Assets and Select Retail Assets, to Bellis Select Warehouse Limited (""Propco 2"") or other affiliates who are obligors thereunder (the ""Post-Completion Disposals"") in exchange for consideration left outstanding (the ""Post**Completion Disposal Receivables""). Alternatively, Select Retail Assets and, as relevant, Substitute Retail Assets may remain held by the ASDA Group but will continue to be charged in favour of the lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility as described in the paragraph below. ASDA will agree to subordinate its claims against Propco 2 or such other affiliates to those of lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility pursuant to a separate subordination agreement. The transfers of each of the Warehouse Assets and, to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, Substitute Retail Assets and Select Retail Assets in connection with the Post-Completion Disposals will be subject to the ASDA Leases, which will remain in effect. To the extent any part of a Substitute Retail Asset or a Select Retail Asset comprises a Forecourt Asset, following the CMA Clearance Date, if documents are agreed by such date, that part of the ASDA Lease which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be surrendered (or, as applicable, renounced) and any security affecting that part of the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be released, such that the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset will be transferred to Propco 2 or its affiliates (to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility) without title to the Forecourt Asset, which will be retained by ASDA by way of a Forecourt Assets Separation. If any relevant Substitute Retail Asset or Select Retail Asset remains held by the ASDA Group at the time of the Forecourt Business Disposal, that part of the ASDA Lease which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be surrendered (or, as applicable, renounced) and any security affecting that part of the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be released and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will permit the disposal of the Forecourt Asset pursuant to the terms of the Forecourt SPA by way of a Forecourt Assets Separation such that the remaining part of the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset excludes the title to that Forecourt Asset. Because certain third-party consents, approvals or certifications in relation to the grant of an ASDA Lease, the grant of ThirdParty Asset Security in respect of one or more Warehouse Assets or, in each case, the registration of any such ASDA Lease or grant of Third-Party Asset Security may remain outstanding prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, entities in the ASDA Group owning such Warehouse Assets may not be able to grant an ASDA Lease or grant Third-Party Asset Security in respect of such Warehouse Assets at the relevant time. Instead, on or about the Acquisition Completion Date, entities in the ASDA Group may enter into ASDA Leases in respect of one of more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the aggregate value of the Affected Warehouse Assets and mortgage (or, as applicable, grant a standard security over) such Substitute Retail Assets to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. In the event that the Land Registry (or jurisdictional equivalent) will not register any Third-Party Asset Security because a deed of covenant is not in the prescribed form due to changes required by the security agent under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility or third-party authorisations are outstanding (in each case in respect of a Warehouse Asset), then an ASDA Lease will be granted instead in respect of a Substitute Retail Asset of approximately equivalent value and Third-Party Asset Security will be granted over such Substitute Retail Asset. See ""The _Transactions—Post-Completion Transactions—Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility."" If, prior to the CMA Clearance Date, outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications_ are received to permit the grant of an ASDA Lease, the grant of Third-Party Asset Security or the registration of either of the foregoing (as the case may be) in respect of any Affected Warehouse Asset, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into an ASDA Lease in respect of such assets (to the extent not already entered into) and will enter into Third-Party Asset Security (to the extent not already entered into) to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. Third-Party Asset Security which will be granted on or about the Acquisition Completion Date over one or more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the value of that Affected Warehouse Asset will then be released and discharged, subject to the Third-Party Asset Security in respect of that Affected Warehouse Asset being successfully registered at the Land Registry (or its jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. If, following the CMA Clearance Date, requisite third-party consents, approvals or certifications in relation to the transfer of one or more Warehouse Assets (in respect of which either an ASDA Lease and Third-Party Asset Security have been granted or an ASDA Lease has been granted and requisite third-party consents, approvals or certifications in relation to the grant of any first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities to be granted by Propco 2 or other affiliates (and the registration of the foregoing) have been obtained) pursuant to the Post-Completion Disposals or the ### 51 ----- registration of a transfer in respect of such assets remain outstanding, entities in the ASDA Group will enter into ASDA Leases in respect of one of more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the aggregate value of such Affected Warehouse Assets. Entities in the ASDA Group that own such Substitute Retail Assets will grant Third-Party Asset Security in respect of such Substitute Retail Assets. To the extent required by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, such Substitute Retail Assets will be transferred to Propco 2 or other affiliates pursuant to the Post-Completion Disposals. Alternatively, such assets may remain held by the ASDA Group but continue to be charged in favour of the lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. If, following the date of the Post-Completion Disposals, outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications are received to permit the grant of an ASDA Lease, the transfer to and the grant of first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities (to the extent that Affected Warehouse Assets are not transferred subject to the existing Third-Party Asset Security) by Propco 2 or other affiliates, and the registration of the foregoing in respect of such Affected Warehouse Assets, the relevant entities in the ASDA Group will enter into an ASDA Lease in respect of the Affected Warehouse Assets (to the extent not already granted) and transfer the Affected Warehouse Assets to Propco 2 or other affiliates, which will grant (unless the Affected Warehouse Asset is transferred subject to existing Third-Party Asset Security) a first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of it to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. First-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities which were granted over one or more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the value of the Affected Warehouse Assets will then be released and discharged, subject to the first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of such Affected Warehouse Assets being successfully registered at the Land Registry (or its jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. See ""The Transactions—Post-Completion Transactions— _Warehouse and Other Select Retail Assets Securing the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.""_ If outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications are received following the CMA Clearance Date to permit the grant of an ASDA Lease and the transfer of Affected Warehouse Assets to Propco 2 or other affiliates, but not the grant of a first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of such Affected Warehouse Assets to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, such Affected Warehouse Assets may nevertheless be transferred to Propco 2 or other affiliates. If, following such transfer, outstanding third-party consents, approvals or certifications are received to permit the grant of first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities by Propco 2 or other affiliates, and the registration of the foregoing in respect of such Affected Warehouse Assets, Propco 2 or other affiliates will grant a first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of them to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. First-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities which were granted over one or more Substitute Retail Assets with an aggregate value approximately equal to the value of such Affected Warehouse Asset will then be released and discharged, subject to the first-ranking legal mortgage, fixed charge or, as applicable, standard security in respect of such Affected Warehouse Asset being successfully registered at the Land Registry (or its jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. If following the transfer of a Warehouse Asset, Select Retail Asset and/or Substitute Retail Asset to Propco 2 or other affiliates, the ASDA Lease granted in respect of such asset is not held by ASL, the relevant tenant is required under the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement to assign the ASDA Lease to ASL with the intent that all ASDA Leases in respect of Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets held by Propco 2 or other affiliates are held by ASL. If, following the transfer of a Substitute Retail Asset to Propco 2 or other affiliates, first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities which were granted over that Substitute Retail Asset are released, Propco 2 or other affiliates may transfer such Substitute Retail Asset to the ASDA Group in advance of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility being repaid in full. The initial term of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is one year from the Acquisition Completion Date, with the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower retaining an option to extend it for a further six months at its own discretion. The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has no scheduled amortisation and we intend to repay it in full ahead of maturity primarily with the net proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions, which would have to be applied promptly in mandatory prepayment of the facility. We may consummate Warehouse Sale Transactions before or after the transfer of Bellis Select Warehouse Holdings Limited to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower described in footnote 3 below. Depending on market conditions and expected transaction values, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower or Propco 2, as applicable, may also sell some or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the Substitute Retail Assets (in each case subject to ASDA Leases), the proceeds of which would also have to be applied in mandatory prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. We anticipate that the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower (or Propco 2, as may be the case) will return to the Issuers, by way of contribution to their equity, in-kind loan pursuant to a deeply subordinated instrument or repayment of Post-Completion Disposal Receivables held by the Group, any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets that it does not sell to repay the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, and, to the extent such proceeds are not used to repay amounts outstanding under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, amounts equal to any net proceeds directly or indirectly received from the sale of any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets (including any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds) (the ""Retail",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The modified retrospective approach was taken and prior year comparatives have not been restated. EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019, for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 is presented after giving effect to the adoption of IFRS 16. Adoption of IFRS 16 in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a decrease in operating costs of £31.4 million and an increase in finance costs of £52.7 million compared to lease-related expenses charged in the prior year under IAS 17. Adoption of IFRS 16 is the primary reason for the increase in finance lease interest of £52.7 million and the increase in depreciation of assets held under finance leases of £149.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the prior year. The addition of these line items back into the calculation of EBITDA results in a higher EBITDA than if EBITDA were prepared under IAS 17, which would include operating lease expense charges within EBITDA. The operating lease expense included in EBITDA in the year ended December 31, 2018 is £188.3 million. (B)   The elimination of IFRS 16 impact adjustment deducts from EBITDA rental payments made during the period in respect of finance leases that would have been accounted for as operating leases under IAS 17 prior to the entry into force of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019. Under IAS 17, our leases would be classified primarily as operating leases, with no assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and rental charges instead of depreciation and interest in the income statement. Increases in rental charges of £133.8 million, £129.7 million and £177.9 million for the nine-month periods ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2020, and the year ended December 31, 2019, respectively, are recognised through the foregoing adjustments within EBITDA. Additionally, below EBITDA adjustments decreasing depreciation and amortisation by £107.7 million, £104.1 million and £143.6 million, and adjustments decreasing interest by £38.4 million, £37.6 million and £51.3 million for the same respective periods have also been made. (C)   The asset write-off adjustment relates to the non-cash write off of all tangible fixed assets with value written off in the normal course of business, usually as a result of store or depot remodelling activities. 2019 also includes an additional write off for some work in progress on an IT system project. ### 71 ----- (D) The prior year ATM rates adjustment reflects the removal of income that has been included in EBITDA following a change in the assessment of business rates for automated teller machines (ATMs). In 2020, a retrospective change was made, as a result of which the Company was entitled to a refund for business rates previously paid. This adjustment removes the income resulting from those refunds for periods earlier than financial year 2020. (E) The bonus top-up adjustment comprises discretionary retrospective enhancements to the annual bonus over and above the parameters of the standard bonus structure. (F) The contract implementation costs adjustment comprises one-off costs relating to the implementation of a new contract for retail colleagues in 2019. In particular, these cost comprised (i) a one-off cost associated with estimated incremental costs as a result of the one-to-one consultations with individual colleagues affected by the proposals, which required such colleagues to be absent from work on the retail shop floor and replaced with incremental time from other colleagues, and (ii) a holiday pay top-up resulting from a transitional agreement made with colleagues to top-up their holiday allowance for 2019 after the new colleague contract introduced in November 2019. (G) The merger costs adjustment reflects an adjustment to remove the directly attributable one-off costs incurred as part of the proposed merger between the Company and J Sainsbury's plc that was subsequently abandoned following CMA review. The adjustment reflects actual costs incurred and management's judgement around which costs were directly attributable to the proposed merger. Costs include consultancy and legal fees, as well as one-off retention bonuses paid to colleagues in connection with that transaction. The proposed merger was announced in May 2018 and the CMA's review was completed in April 2019. (H) The pension contribution adjustment comprises one-off transitional arrangement voluntarily made by the Company that included two annual payments to colleagues' pension funds resulting from changes to the eligibility regime for such contributions. (I) The transaction bonuses adjustment comprises £0.5 million accrued for one-off bonuses that will be paid to colleagues working on the Acquisition. There are expected to be additional transactional bonuses accrued prior to completion. (J) The restructuring adjustments comprise one-off provisions relating to severance costs in connection with the restructuring of home office functions. (K) The pension guarantee adjustment removes amounts paid to Walmart in connection with Walmart's guarantee of the ASDA defined benefit pension scheme. This guarantee payment was terminated when the pension scheme buy-in was completed in October 2019. Therefore, these charges will not continue on a going-forward basis. (L) Options in Walmart shares have historically been awarded to employees of the Company; these share option awards have been accounted for within EBITDA as cash settled equity awards. As no new awards of such options in Walmart shares will be granted and all existing options in Walmart shares will be settled within six months following the Separation, the corresponding charges will fall away and, as a result, are added back for the relevant periods (for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, £96.3 million, for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020, £116.7 million and £83.7 million, respectively, and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, £44.6 million and £129.3 million, respectively). On a going-forward basis, the Company will, however, enhance other colleague incentive programmes. The estimated annual incremental cost of these enhanced incentive programmes is estimated to be £38 million. Therefore, a charge of £38.0 million has been included for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 as well as the years ended December, 31 2018 and 2019. A prorated charge of £28.5 million has been included for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and 2020. This adjustment thus reflects the net amount remaining following the removal of the Walmart shares options and the incremental cost of the enhanced colleague incentive programmes. (M)   The Walmart royalties adjustment reflects the removal of royalties paid by the Company to Walmart as part of an advance pricing agreement calculated using a transfer pricing methodology whereby the amount payable is based on the financial performance of ASL. The services covered by the charge include the use of Walmart intellectual property, which is broadly defined as trade marks, business strategies and business systems. These costs will no longer be applicable following the Separation. However, on-going use of Walmart's trade marks, business strategies and business systems will be covered by the TSA, the TMA and the ASA. (N)   The ISD recharge adjustment removes recharges paid to Walmart in respect of IT services that are allowable for tax purposes. This cost will no longer be applicable following the Separation. However, some of the same services that this cost captures will be covered by the TSA. (O) The TSA charge adjustment relates the charge under the TSA for on-going access to Walmart's IT services, business systems and technology related intellectual property following the Separation. (P) For the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, other adjustments relate to: £8.0 million in adjustments relating to the impact of having had an additional trading day in February 2020 as a result of leap year and £10.0 million in IT and non-IT costs relating to ASDA operating as a standalone company. These costs include the increase in the commissions payable by the Company as consideration for the services provided to the Company by Walmart Global Sourcing, the increase in costs associated with ocean freight, the costs incurred in connection with the creation of new roles to replace certain capabilities previously sourced from Walmart and the cost of insurance cover replacing the insurance cover ASDA has received prior to the Separation through Walmart under Walmart's umbrella insurance policies. (Q) This adjustment relates to certain one-off costs due to the impact of COVID-19 (£226 million), net of certain one-off benefits related to the UK government's business rates holiday for businesses affected by COVID-19 (£171 million). Management has identified incremental costs for the first three quarters of 2020 due to COVID-19, including costs resulting from colleague absences (due to quarantine requirements and protective measures taken for vulnerable colleagues), a one-time ""thank you"" bonus paid by the Company, costs relating to goods not for resale (e.g., face masks, safety provisions, additional security and screens), incremental inventory and supplier costs and the impact of changes in product mix that are expected to be temporary. Management identified a one-off benefit of £171 million, being approximately £28 million per month for the period from April 2020 to September 2020, resulting from a business rates holiday announced by the UK government, which applies to businesses in eligible sectors, including retail businesses, for the UK 2020-2021 tax year. On December 3, 2020, however, ASDA announced its decision to pay business rates tax relief accepted from the UK government in 2020. In calculating this adjustment we have not taken into account any benefit related to the increase in revenues we have experienced as a result of and during the COVID-19 pandemic. (R) In connection with the Acquisition, the Shareholders engaged an international leading consultant to assist them in conducting financial and operational due diligence on ASDA management's plan, with a particular focus on SG&A costs (excluding personnel costs). Based on these due diligence activities conducted to date in connection with the Acquisition, the Shareholders currently believe that there is an opportunity to achieve net run-rate cost savings of £60 million from ASDA's SG&A cost base (excluding personnel costs) within 18 months of the Acquisition Completion Date. In particular, the Shareholders expect projected cost savings from product rationalisation and business integration initiatives. While detailed bottom-up plans are yet to be developed due to regulatory restrictions in place prior to the CMA's approval of the Acquisition, these SG&A cost savings estimated to be realised within 18 months of the Acquisition Completion Date represent only 1.3% of ASDA's SG&A costs of £4.5 billion during the 12 months ended September 30, 2020. The CMA might complete its regulatory approval process relating to the Acquisition later than currently anticipated. Any such delay by the CMA might limit our ability to achieve these expected SG&A cost savings, whether within the timeframe or to the full extent currently anticipated. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating _to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes""_ and ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart."" ### 72 ----- (S) EG foodservice partnership synergies relate to rental income payable from EG Group to ASDA related to EG Group's roll out of foodservice restaurants across the existing ASDA estate. (T) Synergies from the roll out of the ASDA wholesale convenience business relate to the anticipated benefit from the incremental wholesale margin from the roll out of the ASDA convenience proposition (ASDA On the Move) across the EG Group's network. ASDA On the Move is a wholesale arrangement whereby ASDA's own brand products as well as branded products will be sold in third-party-owned smaller convenience store formats. The adjustment of £7.0 million reflects the Shareholders' estimates of the total potential forward-looking run-rate synergies that could be realised in the first 24 months as a result of the Transactions. (U) The adjustment eliminates the EBITDA generated by the Forecourt Assets that will be disposed of pursuant to the Forecourt Business Disposal. See ""The Transactions—The Post-Completion Transactions—Forecourt Disposals."" (V) Rent for Warehouse Assets refers solely to the rental costs associated with the Warehouse Assets. In addition to the Broker's Opinion of Pricing prepared by Colliers, the Issuers received advice from Eastdil Secured in connection with the rental pricing of the Warehouse Assets. This adjustment reflects additional input from Eastdil Secured on the rental pricing of the Warehouse Assets (and, in particular, those Warehouse Assets which are cold storage facilities and would be included in the disposal of any Warehouse Assets as a landlord's fixture and fitting). The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower aims to refinance the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility using only proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions, which relate to such Warehouse Assets. However, the funds raised from the Warehouse Sale Transactions may not be sufficient for this purpose. If this is the case, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower is expected to supplement the proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions with additional proceeds from the transfer of some or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the Substitute Retail Assets in sale transactions with unaffiliated third parties. Any rental costs associated with any Select Retail Assets or Substitute Retail Assets so disposed of are not included in this adjustment. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—We may not be able to consummate the Post-Completion Disposals as _quickly as we anticipate, or at all, and the manner in which we execute the Post-Completion Disposals may differ from what we present in this Offering Memorandum"" and ""The Transactions.""_ (4) Free Cash Flow is calculated as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure.

There can be no assurance that we can continue to successfully compete with existing competitors or new market entrants. Our competition generally includes international and domestic brick-and-mortar retailers (including, generalist grocers, supermarket chains, discount retailers, grocery specialists and convenience stores), some of which also operate omni-channel businesses, as well as online pure players, such as Amazon and Ocado. In recent years, the historically stable grocery retail market in the United Kingdom has undergone a structural shift towards discounters, such as Aldi and Lidl, convenience formats and online retailers, to the detriment of traditional supermarkets and hypermarkets. We generally compete for, among other things, customers, market share, employees, digital prominence, products and services and in other important aspects of the business with many other local, regional, national and global omni-channel retailers, wholesale operators and retail intermediaries. Our competitors generally compete with us on the basis of, among other things, price, quality, selection, availability, services offered to customers, location, store hours, in-store amenities, shopping convenience, brand reputation, overall shopping experience, attractiveness and ease of use of our online platforms, cost and delivery speed of merchandise purchased through our digital platforms or through our omni-channel integration of our physical and digital operations. In executing our strategy, we may face a variety of competitive challenges, including, among others: - potential emergence of new competitors, including foreign and domestic retailers entering our markets, or consolidation, strengthening or expanded offerings of existing operators, as has been the case in recent years with the emergence of discounters (for more information, see ""Industry"" and ""Business—Key Strengths""); - potential creation by competitors of new store formats, additional convenience grocery retail store offerings, in-store or online services, delivery and pick-up options or online platforms that customers may prefer; - the risk of our competitors successfully adopting our business model in their own stores; - competitive pressure on product pricing from core competitors, as well as discount and online retailers; and - the risk of our competitors providing better service, quality, value or availability of products. The performance of our competitors and changes in their pricing, promotions, product mix or other business strategies, and our response (or failure to respond) to such competitive pressures, may lead to lower sales revenue, higher operating expenses and/or lower profit margins and may require a significant amount of management attention and resources, which may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our ongoing business operations. There can be no assurance that, with evolving customer preferences, our customers will not shift towards competitors with a different business model. ### 75 ----- Even in geographies, channels and formats where we have a strong retail presence, we face the risk that new retail market entrants may attempt to gain market share through pricing pressure. For example, the UK grocery retail market has seen the rapid growth of discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and Lidl) that compete through differentiation on price coupled with a more limited selection of own-brand products. We experience downward pricing pressure, and if we are unable to maintain our competitive position, we could experience additional downward pressure on prices, lower demand for our products, reduced retail margins, the inability to take advantage of new business opportunities and the loss of market share, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In recent years, and in particular during the COVID-19 pandemic, the demand for online shopping services has increased substantially and many of our competitors have expanded their online offerings. If our competitors are able to offer faster or cheaper deliveries, and/or more convenient delivery options, we could lose current or potential customers, our brand and reputation could suffer, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. To remain competitive, we must continue to develop and enhance our online offering and the information systems that support our online activities, as well continue to optimise our logistics and distribution capabilities. This may require the acquisition of equipment and software and the development, either internally or through third-parties, of new proprietary software and logistics and distribution solutions. In addition, any impairment of or disruption to our supply chain or delivery fleet could result in a disruption in the delivery of our products to our online customers, which could harm our brand and could generate additional costs. Furthermore, the online grocery industry in the United Kingdom may not sustain or improve upon current levels of demand, and we may fail to develop our online retail proposition to successfully appeal to a broader customer base and sustain current growth rates. If we are unable to effectively compete with our online competitors or if we fail to retain and attract online customers, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we may fail to successfully compete with the growing convenience retail market. If we are unable to successfully expand our operations into the convenience retail market and the convenience retail market continues to grow, this may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry Risks Relating to Our General Operations,13.1.2,"The impact of COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to create uncertainty in our market and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control.","In late 2019, a new strain of coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 or SARSCoV-2), which can cause coronavirus disease (COVID-19), was detected in Wuhan, China. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and governmental authorities around the world implemented measures to reduce the spread of COVID-19. For example, in March 2020, the United Kingdom imposed the first set of significant lockdown measures to control the spread of COVID19. These measures to stop the spread of COVID-19 have adversely affected workforces, customer sentiment, economies and financial markets, and, along with causing overall decreased customer spending and widespread uncertainty following months of lockdowns and related uncertainty, have led to an economic downturn in the United Kingdom and have had a direct impact on our business. COVID-19 poses a risk to our colleagues, our customers, our suppliers and the communities in which we operate. As the pandemic has developed, customer fear about becoming ill with the virus and recommendations and/or mandates from national and local authorities to social distance or self-quarantine have continued to have an impact on the UK marketplace. These recommendations and mandates, as well as general fears about gathering in public places, has adversely affected, among other things, our instore traffic, our ability to adequately staff our stores, depots, packing and processing facilities and other facilities and our suppliers' ability to provide products on a timely basis. See ""Management's Discussion _and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Result of Operations—COVID-19."" If we do not respond appropriately or in a timely enough manner to the pandemic_ and its effects, or if customers or colleagues perceive our response to be inadequate or inappropriate, our brand, reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Resurgences (or ""waves"") of COVID-19 are likely to occur. We cannot predict when or where these waves will occur, the duration of such waves, how far into the future such waves will continue to occur nor can we predict with any certainty the impacts of such subsequent waves, including the impacts of future national or local lockdowns or other measures implemented by national and/or local authorities. As of January 2021, subsequent waves of COVID-19 were significantly affecting many countries, including the United Kingdom and other countries from which we source products, with cases rising markedly in recent weeks and with new, more contagious strains of the virus emerging. On October 12, 2020, the UK Prime Minister announced a three-tiered system of restrictions across England, which came into effect on ### 76 ----- October 14, 2020 in order to help control the spread of the virus. Under this system, regions are classified as either 'medium', 'high' or 'very high' risk and assigned increasingly stringent lockdown restrictions to correspond with their designated tier. On November 5, 2020, the United Kingdom imposed its second set of significant lockdown measures, which ended on December 2, 2020. On December 18, 2020, the UK Prime Minister announced the addition of a fourth tier in the COVID-19 restrictions system, due to the presence of a new, more infectious variant of the virus in the United Kingdom. On December 20, the United Kingdom imposed its third set of significant lockdown measures and placed the South East of the United Kingdom, including London, into tier four lockdown. On January 4, 2021 the UK Prime Minister announced the addition of a fifth tier in the COVID-19 restrictions system, the highest level of COVID-19 restrictions, due to the record high and escalating case numbers of COVID-19 present in the United Kingdom. In tier five, England is in a full lockdown, pursuant to which all persons are instructed to stay home except for a few necessary purposes, including essential work and buying food and medicine. The tier five lockdown is expected to continue until at least February 15, 2021. While none of our grocery retail stores have been closed as a result of such lockdowns, there can be no guarantee that this will continue to be the case or that more stringent rules and restrictions will not be applied in the future in a manner that could materially adversely impact our business. Additionally, local authorities have imposed and may impose stricter rules and restrictions in addition to those imposed by the national tiered system, which may have further material adverse impacts on our business and industry. The placement of areas into the tiers is outside of our control and is expected to be dynamic and unpredictable for the foreseeable future. The tiered alert system applies only to England: the devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are in charge of designing and implementing their own COVID-19 restrictions, which may be as or more stringent than the English tiered system. In light of rising case levels in the United Kingdom and around the world, future national and local lockdowns are foreseeable. Additionally, there may be a decrease in demand for certain of our products in the event of further resurgences of COVID-19 or the occurrence of other pandemics, other public health emergencies or threats, or potential or perceived threats to food and drug safety, any of which may necessitate certain regulatory responses and the result of which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We currently operate our grocery retail stores and facilities as an ""essential"" business. If the classification of what an ""essential"" business is changes, or other government regulations are adopted, we may be required to severely or even completely curtail operations, which would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even though our stores and facilities are considered essential businesses, national and local authorities may impose regulations and limitations on the operations of our stores and facilities, such as, among other things, limiting customer traffic, hours of operation or access to certain products (as has been the case in Wales, where ""firebreak"" measures have limited the products that grocery retailers are permitted to sell during the firebreak period to certain essential goods), requiring us to implement track and trace measures and mandating certain health and safety measures. Complying with these regulations and limitations requires the diversion of financial and human resources away from other parts of our business and increases costs, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our noncompliance, or perceived non-compliance with lockdown measures could lead to formal sanctions and could also harm our brand and reputation. Even while our stores are open, social distancing and other policies implemented to slow the further spread of COVID-19 may impact the operation and appeal of our stores. For example, customers unaccustomed to wearing face coverings or observing social distancing guidance may choose to shop online, which may reduce our in-store business. Even when social distancing policies are lifted, interest in visiting stores and making discretionary purchases may remain weak due to health concerns or recessionary spending patterns. Furthermore, we believe that some of the changes that have arisen during and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic by us and in the United Kingdom as a whole will be persistent and potentially long-lasting, while others may be less so. For example, following the end of the pandemic, there may be a shift of consumer preferences to more out-of-home dining, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Certain of our colleagues have tested positive for COVID-19. We have, and may in the future be required to temporarily close certain of our stores, offices or other facilities for cleaning or to take other responsive or precautionary measures. Likewise, planned construction, renovation and maintenance, as well as the opening of new stores may be delayed, suspended or terminated due to COVID-19-related requirements, such as requiring that workers only leave their homes for essential business, or due to the suspension of governmental permit issuances due to the pandemic. Where appropriate and possible, we have transitioned a significant number of our colleagues to a remote work environment, in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, which may exacerbate certain risks to our business. ### 77 ----- A large part of our workforce, such as our colleagues who work in our stores, factories or our distribution facilities, cannot work remotely and we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken can fully mitigate the risks posed to them and to our customers by COVID-19 and we may be subject to potential litigation as a result of colleagues alleging that we have facilitated an unsafe working environment or have increased their exposure to COVID-19, or customers or colleagues who claim they have contracted the virus at our stores or other facilities, which may cause us to incur significant costs and which may have a negative impact on our brand and reputation. During the first lockdown, we experienced increased costs, including, amongst others, as a result of goodwill payments to suppliers, increased employment costs relating to increased absences (including for sick colleagues or colleagues following quarantine recommendations), full pay to vulnerable staff members during the 12-week isolation period, employment of safety marshals and operation of stores with extended hours to decrease store congestion. Certain of these costs continued during the second lockdown and we may be subject to similar costs in the event of future lockdowns. We may also be subject to potential litigation initiated by colleagues alleging that we have facilitated an unsafe working environment or have increased their exposure to COVID-19. All of these risks may be further exacerbated by resurgences of the virus. Although the government has increasingly employed sophisticated strategies for combatting the virus such as Test and Trace and localised R-factor measurement in an effort to avoid costly and extensive lockdown measures, the magnitude of possible virus resurgences and the resulting impacts on the economy may materially negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary spending by customers, public health events and other factors described elsewhere in this ""Risk Factors"" section. To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is continuing to cause, significant disruption in economic activity globally, which is expected to lead to a decline in discretionary spending. Our revenue may be negatively impacted by adverse changes in the perceived or actual economic climate, including higher unemployment rates, declines in income levels and loss of personal wealth resulting from the impact of COVID-19 and measures implemented to respond to it. Although we are generating revenue, our revenue may not increase in proportion to our fixed costs and deferred costs and our revenue may not be sufficient to offset the full impact of a potential shutdown of our stores, were that to occur, or curtailment of our operations. If our cost base is higher than our revenue, our cash management policies may fail due to factors beyond our control. In 2020, our profitability has been adversely impacted by COVID-19 in terms of increased costs associated with retail colleague wages, bonus payments and higher retail operating expenditures. During the first lockdown, consumers favoured convenience stores over larger grocery retail stores. Unlike the traditional grocers, currently we do not operate any convenience grocery retail stores and, as a result, this shift towards convenience grocery retail stores adversely affected us. Future lockdowns with similar consumer preferences could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. COVID-19 has also impacted our sales in terms of product mix, with changing customer habits towards less out-of-home consumption, stockpiling and increased use of online grocery services driving higher food sales volumes, while decreased clothing sales and the temporary closure of our ASDA Living stores has led to decreases in non-food sales and the effects of lockdowns on automobile usage has driven decreases in fuel sales. During the first wave of COVID-19 and the accompanying lockdown periods, we relied on access to government aid and mitigation programmes, including the business rates relief holiday for the 2020 to 2021 tax year. Our mitigation strategy was reinforced by legislation such as the UK Coronavirus Act 2020, the Coronavirus (Scotland) Acts of 2020 and the UK Corporate Insolvency and Governance Act 2020, which introduced certain protections in relation to lease forfeitures (and irritancies), and temporary restrictions on the ability of creditors to file statutory demands and winding up petitions in the United Kingdom based solely on the failure to comply with (for example) rent payment obligations as a result of COVID-19. However, in December 2020, we announced our intention to voluntarily resume payments of the applicable business rate, for the period during the COVID-19 pandemic where we had benefitted from the business rates holiday relief. We estimate that the payment of business rates for the full period of the business rates holiday to range from approximately £320 million to £340 million. While we have entered into initial discussions with HMRC around repayment, the mechanism and timing of repayment has not yet been agreed. During subsequent waves of COVID-19 such government aid, mitigation programmes, negotiations with landlords and/or protective legislation may not be available to the same extent as in the past and our cash outlay levels to meet ongoing additional COVID-19 related costs might be significantly higher during such subsequent waves than they were during the first wave. Therefore, we would only be able to rely on our ability to pause capital expenditures, implement cost reductions and defer payments, which could significantly reduce our overall ability to mitigate potential cash burn. ### 78 ----- In addition to the lockdown measures imposed in the United Kingdom, on December 20, 2020, numerous countries across Europe, including France, imposed travel restrictions on travellers from the United Kingdom in response to the discovery and spread of the more infectious variant of the virus in the United Kingdom. Such restrictions resulted in a temporary disruption of the main trade routes between Europe and the United Kingdom, in particular at UK ports. On December 21, 2020, the Port of Dover halted all exports to France for 48 hours in response to the travel restrictions imposed by the French government on travellers from the United Kingdom. We rely on UK ports such as the Port of Dover to import a large portion of our supplies. We can provide no assurance that significant restrictions affecting movement of goods into or out of UK ports will not be imposed in the future, including as a measure to control the spread of COVID-19. Such restrictions may result in significant disruption and delays to our supply chain and may require us to incur additional costs or make amendments to our usual supply chain, which may in turn have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. On December 22, 2020, France reopened its borders with the United Kingdom to lorry drivers, provided they are tested for COVID-19. Future travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic imposed by France or other European countries could lead to further and longer supply disruptions for the goods we import from or through Europe. Such disruptions could result in our inability to offer certain products to customers or force us to increase prices of certain products, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to the factors listed above, COVID-19 and the measures taken to respond to it have created an environment of uncertainty and rapid, unpredictable changes that exacerbates and magnifies certain of the other risks we face. The effect of COVID-19 on our business and our wider industry will ultimately depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic in the United Kingdom and globally, the length of time it takes for demand to return to normal levels and for normal economic and operating conditions to resume and the potential for, and uncertainty surrounding, virus resurgence. There are no comparable recent events that provide us with guidance, and so we cannot yet know the full impact of COVID-19 on our business with any certainty nor can we provide any assurance that COVID-19 will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. To the extent COVID-19 impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening other risks described in this ""Risk Factors"" section, such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness. Each of the factors above may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

On June 23, 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom opted to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum and on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom withdrew from the European Union (""Brexit""). On December 24, 2020, it was announced that a draft trade and cooperation agreement had been agreed between the United Kingdom government and the EU Commission. This agreement has provisional application as of January 1, 2021, was ratified on December 30, 2020 by the UK Parliament and is subject to formal approval by the European Parliament. If the agreement is not formally approved by the European Parliament, the United Kingdom will no longer have access to the European Union Single Market, which, could result, among other things, in the disruption of the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union, undermine bilateral cooperation in key geographic areas and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union or other nations as the United Kingdom pursues independent trade relations. This could have an impact on our operations and on the general and economic conditions in the United Kingdom. Following withdrawal from the European Union, barrier-free trade access between the United Kingdom and other member states of the European Union could be diminished or eliminated and the United Kingdom may no longer be covered by trade agreements entered into by the European Union which apply to all member states and so will either have to seek to negotiate new trade agreements or join existing trade agreements (such as the World Trade Organisation tariffs) which could result in the transfer of goods between the European Union and the United Kingdom, or between certain non-European Union countries and the United Kingdom, becoming subject to import/export duties and/or non-tariff trade barriers (including health and safety, product labelling and other standards, many of which are currently standardised across the European Union). Such trade barriers could lead to delays to our logistics and ### 79 ----- distribution operations including delays in the importation of fresh produce or a reduction of our product catalogue (we have modelled scenarios with respect to a reduction in capacity at Calais and have instituted a port delay risk mitigation plan to be deployed in case of delays) and result in the cost of doing business being materially adversely affected if not passed on, in whole or in part, to customers in the form of price increases. Even if we are able to pass on some or all of such costs through price increases, such price increases may influence customer spending decisions and priorities and adversely impact our revenue. According to UK government figures, in 2019, 26% of food consumed in the United Kingdom was sourced from the European Union, and we believe that a similar percentage applies to our own food sales. A loss of access to global trade deals could lead to import tariffs that increase our supply costs. Additionally, since we operate 17 stores in Northern Ireland, Brexit could have an additional impact on our business, results of operation and prospects due to significant bureaucratic hurdles. Currently, the EU has granted the United Kingdom a six-month exemption from the EU ban on prohibited and restricted goods (such as minced meat) being transported into Northern Ireland. Once this exemption ends in July 2021, ASDA will require alternative sourcing. In addition, current Brexit proposals would result in the required significant re-labelling and customs classification and declarations on products sold in Northern Ireland. We may not be able to preserve our profit margin during periods of increased food inflation and increased production costs without suffering reduced revenue, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Another potential outcome of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union is that limitations may be placed on the principle of free movement of people which currently permits European Union nationals to work in the United Kingdom. IPL and certain of our primary producers and suppliers currently employ a significant number of European Union nationals and since the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union is expected to lead to restrictions being placed on European Union nationals working in the United Kingdom, the number of people employed by these primary producers and suppliers may decline which could have a material and adverse effect on their business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. The referendum result has created significant political and economic uncertainty about the future relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union generally, and the United Kingdom's future trading relationship with countries within and outside the European Union specifically, which could make adverse changes in general economic conditions or adverse exchange rate movements more likely to occur and which could, in turn, have a material and adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, including the above effects and others we cannot anticipate, could lead to increased costs, potential staff shortages, adverse currency impacts and increased regulatory burden and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.

Our success has been founded in part on our ability to develop our brand as a leading UK retailer of quality, competitively priced grocery, clothing and general merchandise. Maintaining the reputation of and value associated with our brand is central to the success of our business. This can be an especially difficult task for retailers, particularly in light of the development of social media in recent years, which has led to a sharp increase in reputational risks. Any event, such as a significant product recall or negative press reaction to statements made or actions taken, or the failure to make certain statements or take certain actions, by us or our senior management, that could damage our brand or reputation or cause customers to lose confidence in the safety and quality of the products we sell could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our principal brand names and trade marks (such as the ASDA logo) are key assets of our business. See ""Business—Our Intellectual Property."" We rely upon a combination of copyright and trade mark laws to establish and protect our intellectual property rights, but cannot be certain that the actions we have taken or will take in the future will be adequate to prevent material violation of our proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that litigation will not be necessary to enforce our trade mark or proprietary rights or to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of third parties. Adverse publicity, legal action or other factors could lead to substantial erosion in the value of our brand, which could lead to decreased customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See also ""—From time to time we and/or our management are subject to claims that ### 80 ----- _can result in litigation, arbitration, tax or regulatory proceedings which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability.""_ The brand names of our own-brand products also represent an important asset of our business. Certain of these own-brand items are manufactured and/or packaged by third parties, and while our policies set out quality control standards, we do not control these third parties or their quality control, employment, ethics or other business practices. If we are unable to control and guarantee the quality of our own-brand products, our reputation may be damaged, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to a number of food safety and hygiene regulations. See ""Business—Regulation—Food Safety, Hygiene, Labelling and Nutrition and Consumer _Protection."" Failures to comply with these regulations could result in a number of adverse consequences,_ including fines, loss of licences, costs of compliance or certification requirements. We may not be able to ensure that our customers always enjoy safe, quality products. We sell food for human consumption, which subjects us to safety risks such as contamination (including the presence of an undeclared allergen, a foreign object, substance, unintentional microbe or chemical, other agent or residue or the introduction of a genetically modified organism), spoilage, mislabelling and product tampering, all of which could lead to product withdrawals or recalls or destruction of inventory and could result in bad publicity, temporary store or warehouse closures and substantial costs in connection with compliance or remediation. We may also be impacted by any assertion that our products have caused illness or injury, whether true or false, proven or unproven. We could also be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury stemming from product contamination, spoilage, mislabelling, product tampering or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of our products. From time to time we also recall products. Risks to the health of our customers can also arise from our branded and own label suppliers, some of whom are third-parties who operate outside of our direct control, in relation to the ingredients, foods and products we sell in our stores. For example, we rely on suppliers, some of whom are third-parties who operate outside of our control, for ingredients, foods and products we sell in our stores. Our use of thirdparty suppliers increases the risk that any of the aforementioned types of incidents could be caused by factors outside of our control and that multiple locations could be affected. In addition, food or product safety-related risks may also occur under any one of our own-brand labels and we may be impacted by negative publicity regarding any assertion that our food or other products have resulted in illness or injury. Our customers expect that we will provide them with a large selection of safe, high-quality products. If we are unable to control and guarantee the quality of the products we sell, especially our own-brand products and in-store services, our brand and reputation may be negatively impacted. ### 81 ----- We rely upon electrical power to operate all of our facilities across our distribution network. To attain maximum performance, these types of facilities must often operate on a continuous basis and at the appropriate pre-set temperatures. As a result, any shortage or interruption in power supply may result in food spoilage and any extended power supply shortages or interruptions could result in perishable food losses, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Cold chain requirements, setting out the temperatures at which our ingredients and products must be stored and transported, are established both by law and by us to help guarantee the safety of our food products. Our cold chain must be maintained from the moment the ingredients arrive at, or are frozen by, our suppliers, through transportation and ultimately to the time of sale in our stores or delivery to our customers. A failure in our cold chain could lead to food spoilage, risks to the health of our customers, fines and other penalties and damage to our brand and reputation, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Consumers are increasingly focused on the traceability of food products to assist them in deciding what to purchase. In January 2013, incidents of horse meat in parts of the European food supply chain mislabelled as beef were identified, negatively impacting retailers and producers throughout Europe, including ASDA, and led to additional standards, such as BRC standards on traceability, food fraud and food defence. While we conduct quality practices and procedures, it may be difficult to detect contamination, spoilage, mislabelling, product tampering or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of our products, particularly fraudulent or malicious activity. Adverse publicity about these types of problems, whether valid or not, may discourage customers from buying our products or may affect our brand and reputation. Our actual or perceived sale of unsafe food products could result in product liability claims, a loss of customer confidence, product recalls and legal claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also face additional risks from product defects in relation to the sale of our non-food products, including, for example, the risks of battery explosions, appliance malfunction or toys or other items that prove to be dangerous. If products we purchase from our suppliers are damaged or defective, we may not be able to return products to these suppliers and obtain refunds on our purchase price or obtain indemnification from them for any damages caused. Our brand and reputation could be damaged by the marketing of such dangerous or defective products, especially in case of serious defects, such as products containing harmful substances, causing death, physical harm or other health problems. In addition, there is a risk that compliance lapses by us or by our suppliers could occur, which could lead to investigation by agencies responsible for customer product safety. In all such cases, especially if there is a prolonged impact on product quality, our brand and reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. Certain risks are inherent in the operation of food-to-go, serve-over and self-serve counters and our brand and reputation could be damaged to the extent the quality of these facilities fall below our established standards. For example, if particular temperatures and environments are not properly maintained, food safety could be compromised and harmful bacteria, such as Escherichia coli or Listeria monocytogenes could develop. Additionally, these facilities are also subject to public tampering and contamination, over which we have limited control. A significant lawsuit, widespread product recall or other events leading to the loss of customer confidence in the safety and quality of our products could damage our brand and reputation and negatively impact our sales, profitability and prospects for growth. Further, if a product recall is required in circumstances where the financial consequences are not covered by the relevant supplier or our insurance, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance. Although we maintain product liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Even if future product liability claims against us are unsuccessful, these claims could be costly and timeconsuming and may divert our management's time and resources from operating our business and may harm our brand and reputation. Even if our products are not affected by contamination or other incidents that compromise their safety and quality, we are subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by widespread contamination, widespread diseases (such as H1N1, SARS, MERS, BSE and avian influenza) and evolving nutritional and health-related concerns. Regulatory authorities may limit the supply of certain types of food products in response to public health concerns, and customers may perceive certain products to be unsafe or unhealthy, which could require us or our suppliers to find alternative ingredients or products that may not be available at commercially reasonable prices or within acceptable time constraints. In addition, such governmental regulations may require us to identify replacement products for our customers or, alternatively, to discontinue certain offerings or limit the range of product offerings. We may be unable ### 82 ----- to find substitutes that are as appealing to our customers, or such substitutes may not be widely available or may be available only at increased costs. Such substitutions or limitations could also reduce demand for our products.

Given the varied backgrounds and tastes of our customer base, we must offer a sufficient range of products to satisfy a broad spectrum of preferences. Demand for our food products is affected by customer tastes and preferences, which are impacted by, among other things, social trends, health concerns, ethical considerations and culinary trends. Customers are increasingly focusing on health and wellness, including avoiding foods with certain ingredients such as trans fats, gluten, sugar, sodium, processed wheat, animal products or other product attributes and preferring foods which fit in to their image of a healthy lifestyle. Customers have also shown increasing preference for vegan and organic products, ethically sourced products, environmentally-friendly product packaging and products that support local business. We must adapt and develop products to address these trends and preferences in a timely manner in order to remain competitive. Further, our customers increasingly expect a seamless omni-channel experience and when making a decision to purchase products from us, want to be able to have access to greater amounts of information than ever before, including on traceability, environmental sustainability and nutritional value. Likewise, our clothing, home product lines and general merchandise offer are subject to changing customer tastes in apparel and decor and are also impacted by sustainability considerations. Customers also increasingly expect to be able to interact with us in a variety of ways, such as through mobile application purchases, which require investments in technology and human resources. If we do not identify or effectively respond to customer trends and preferences in a timely manner, or if we fail to meet our customers' expectations, it could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, demand for our products and services, our market share and the growth of our business, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is difficult to quickly, consistently and successfully predict the products and services our customers will be interested in and respond to changes in their shopping patterns. Responding to shifts in customer preferences and expectations also can entail significant costs. The success of our business depends on how accurately and quickly we predict customer demand, availability of merchandise, the related impact on the demand for existing products and the competitive environment. Price transparency, assortment of products, customer experience, convenience and the speed, ease and cost of delivery or collection options are of primary and increasing importance to customers, particularly as a result of the growth of digital tools and social media that inform customers.

As a result, the portion of total customer expenditures with retailers occurring through online platforms is increasing and the pace of this increase could accelerate. Accordingly, an important part of our business strategy involves offering a seamless omni-channel customer experience by integrating innovative online and mobile application-based solutions. Our ability to adapt our online offer and, in particular, to develop online sales depends on a number of factors, including our ability to successfully market our websites and social media, our ability to identify additional key partnerships for the expansion of our online channels, the capability of our existing distribution network to accommodate our growing online operations and the ability to integrate our growing online operations on a profitable basis. Additionally, we cannot assure you that our online operations will become as profitable as our brick-and-mortar businesses and, as a result, the expected increased proportion of online operations could negatively impact our future profitability. In addition, integrating innovative omni-channel options into the retail store experience is critical for us to maintain our market position. Our strategy also relies on identifying, developing and/or adopting key technology solutions that allow us to integrate innovative online shopping processes into our operations. We may not be able to secure the requisite technology to implement our strategy, either due to cost or intellectual property rights of third parties. We may also fail to integrate new digital tools into our systems which could reduce their effectiveness. Our strategy, which includes investments in online channels, technology, store remodels and other customer-focused initiatives, may not adequately or effectively allow us to grow our business, maintain or grow our overall market position or otherwise offset the impact of the growth of our business. The success of our strategy will depend in large measure on our ability to continue building and delivering a seamless omni-channel shopping experience for our customers. Failure to successfully execute this strategy may adversely affect our market position and financial performance. In addition, increased online sales, including increasing online grocery sales, could result in a reduction in the amount of traffic in our stores, which would, in turn, reduce the opportunities for cross-store sales of merchandise that such traffic creates and could reduce our sales within our stores and materially adversely affect our financial performance. Given the various risks to which we are exposed and the uncertainties inherent in our business, we cannot guarantee the successful execution of our business strategy.

The George Clothing and George Home brands compete on the basis of, among other things, the location of our stores; website, mobile applications and their respective design; the breadth, quality, style price and availability of our merchandise; and the level of customer service offered. In particular, the George Clothing brand faces competition from other low-cost and fast fashion retailers that have recently made significant price investments in their merchandise offerings and target some of the same categories of customers as the George Clothing brand. We expect competition to increase in the future. There are no significant economic barriers for others to enter our apparel, footwear and homeware retail sectors and our existing competitors are constantly adjusting their pricing, business strategies and promotional activity (particularly during holiday periods) in response to changing market conditions or their own financial condition. As a result of such competition, the George Clothing business has experienced declining revenue over recent years. Additionally, the substantial sales growth in online apparel, footwear and homeware retail within the last decade has encouraged the entry of many new competitors, new business models and an increase in competition from established companies looking for ways to create successful online shopping alternatives. The internet and other technologies also facilitates comparison shopping in our apparel, footwear and homeware retail segments. Our digital channel competes against numerous websites, mobile applications and catalogues, which may have a greater volume of circulation and web traffic or more effective marketing through online media and social networking sites. We offer an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers and use social media and mobile applications as a way to interact with them to enhance their shopping experiences.

We operate with tailored logistics structures concentrated in a relatively small number of distribution facilities to supply and deliver our products. There is a risk that any of these facilities may be materially adversely affected by extraordinary events, such as a fire or an explosion. In some such cases, insurance is subject to limitations and therefore may not cover all of our losses.

In addition to IPL, we are also dependent on certain third-party suppliers for our products, which exposes us to risks that such suppliers may fail to meet timelines, provide us with sufficient inventory or comply with our specifications. If a delay or interruption of delivery were to occur either temporarily or permanently for any reason, we may not be able to meet customer demand, which may result in fewer sales and may harm our brand. Further, as we require our suppliers to meet certain specifications and standards to ensure the quality of our products, the use of third-party suppliers increases the demands on our quality control personnel.

While we have long-term relationships with many of our suppliers, and alternate suppliers are generally available, we do not have long-term contracts with all of our suppliers. As a result, certain of our suppliers could increase their prices or fail to deliver sufficient quantities to us in a timely fashion or at all. ### 87 ----- There is also a risk that suppliers will consolidate, giving us fewer choices and creating pricing pressure. Any deterioration in our relationships with our suppliers, the imposition of stricter conditions by suppliers (especially with respect to stringent payment terms or as a result of the willingness of credit insurers to reduce the exposure of our suppliers) or the non-renewal of our key supply agreements may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we experience a need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that additional suppliers will be available when required on terms acceptable to us. In addition, even if we were able to find new suppliers on acceptable terms, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it would take to train such suppliers in our methods, products, quality control standards, employment, health and safety standards. Our operations are dependent on a number of key supplier relationships, including IPL. While IPL is wholly-owned by ASDA, any interruption to IPL's operations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, we are dependent on suppliers of the machinery used within our hub and spoke facilities for their continued supply and maintenance. We are also dependent on other third parties, including landlords and distributors, and other suppliers. If any such suppliers ceased operations or was temporarily unable to supply its respective services, this could materially adversely affect our operations or financial condition until an alternative supplier is found, and there could be no guarantee that any alternative supplier would be as satisfactory as the existing arrangements. Any adverse changes to our relationships with these suppliers and third parties or in a reduction in availability or level of service offered by these suppliers and third party providers could restrict our ability to conduct our business and thereby adversely impact our financial condition and prospects. Our relationship with suppliers based in foreign markets presents certain risks. For example, if such suppliers are non-compliant with labour laws on manufacturing and the values listed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the ILO's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, we could be subject to action from international trade unions with whom we have no day to day relationship. There is also a risk that our suppliers may not comply with relevant anti-corruption laws, health and safety laws, environmental laws or other laws and regulations, which could result in reputational damage to ASDA's brand, loss of consumer trust or human rights or anti-corruption law investigations of ASDA. In addition to non-compliance with international or domestic labour, health and safety laws or environmental laws, we face a variety of risks generally associated with sourcing products from suppliers in foreign markets, including, among others, political instability; increased security requirements applicable to foreign goods; the imposition of taxes, duties, other charges and restrictions on imports; currency and exchange rate risks; risks related to environmental matters or other issues in the foreign countries or factories in which our products are manufactured; delays in shipping; and increased costs of transportation.

However, licence terms may impose on the user compliance requirements and obligations to disclose modifications we have made to the software to third parties. Our ability to realise fully the commercial benefits of any such software may be restricted because: - open source licences may be drafted in legally ambiguous language and may result in unanticipated consequences or obligations regarding our software; - due to the requirements to licence modified software, our competitors or licensees may have access to information which may help them to develop competitive products; ### 91 ----- - open source software is available to the public for anyone to access and utilise, including our competitors; and - it may be difficult for us to identify accurately the developers of the open source code (who may be licensors of the software) and whether the licensed software infringes third party intellectual property rights. Furthermore, to the extent we use open source software we face certain more general risks which apply to any organisation making use of such software. Our use of GNU General Public Licence (""GPL"") software could subject certain portions of our proprietary software to GPL requirements, including an obligation on us to disclose that software to third parties and to permit them to use the software free of charge. Finally, open source licences typically present onerous compliance requirements and failure to observe these may result in litigation or the loss of the right to use the software which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and future prospects.

We use our websites, social media, online advertising, and email campaigns to interact with our customers and as a means to enhance their shopping experience. As a part of our omni-channel strategy, we offer home delivery and pickup options under which many products available for purchase online can be picked up in-store by the customer via our Click & Collect offer, which provides additional customer traffic at such stores.

Consumers value readily available information concerning retailers, manufacturers and their goods and services and often act on such information without further investigation, authentication and without regard to its accuracy. The availability of information on social media platforms and devices is virtually immediate as is its impact. Social media platforms and devices immediately publish the content their subscribers and participants post, often without filters or checks on accuracy of the content posted. The opportunity for dissemination of information, including inaccurate information, is virtually limitless. Information concerning or affecting us may be posted on such platforms and devices at any time. Information posted may be inaccurate and adverse to us, and it may harm our business. The harm may be immediate without affording us an opportunity for redress or correction. Such platforms also could be used for the dissemination of trade secret information or compromise of other valuable company assets, any of which could harm our business. We also use social media platforms as marketing tools. For example, we maintain Instagram, Facebook and Twitter accounts. As laws and regulations rapidly evolve to govern the use of these platforms and devices, the failure by us, our colleagues or third parties acting at our direction to abide by applicable laws and regulations in the use of these platforms and devices could adversely impact our business or subject us to fines or other penalties. ### 92 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Such leases usually provide for regular rent reviews, at which time our rental costs may increase in line with certain indices. Our ability to maintain our existing rental rates during renewals or to renew any expired lease on favourable terms will depend on many factors which are not within our control, such as applicable real estate laws and regulations, payments for utilities, local taxes or assessments, conditions in the local real estate market, competition for desirable properties and our relationships with current and prospective landlords. If rent reviews were to increase at higher rates than currently anticipated or if we were unable to renew any expired leases on commercially favourable terms, our financial performance could be adversely impacted. Further, we may be unable to extend expiring lease agreements at all or may have no or limited ability to close certain store locations that do not meet our financial targets or are no longer consistent with our brands' positioning. These changes in the size of our store network can have a significant impact on our revenues and expenses from one period to the next, which affect the comparability of our results during these periods. Our ability to enter into leases to open new retail locations depends on the availability of locations that meet our criteria for traffic, square footage, lease economics, demographics and other factors. In addition, the market for suitable retail locations is highly competitive. Some of our competitors may have the ability to negotiate more favourable commercial lease terms than we can. If we are unable to renew our lease agreements as they expire or if any of our existing lease agreements are terminated for any reason and we are unable to secure other favourable locations on acceptable terms, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Approximately 124,491 of these colleagues worked in our store network and 12,662 in our distribution network. From time to time, and in particular in our distribution networks, we may experience labour disputes and we can never rule out the possibility of work stoppages. We are also exposed to similar risks involving the workforce of our thirdparty suppliers, including all of our distribution centre operators. In particular, a labour stoppage or other interruption at one of our suppliers or distribution centres would impact our ability to supply our stores or online orders and could have a pronounced effect on our operations as a result. As we do not directly control our suppliers, we have limited information on labour relations between our suppliers and their workforces. ### 93 ----- In addition, some of our colleagues are members of trade unions and are parties to collective bargaining agreements, which contain provisions covering issues such as working hours and compensation. See ""Business—Our Colleagues."" We may not be able to extend existing agreements, renew them on their current terms or, negotiate such agreements in a favourable and timely manner or without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our business. If we seek to reduce colleague terms, or otherwise are unable to maintain satisfactory colleague and labour relations, the results could include work stoppages, strikes or other industrial action or labour difficulties (including higher labour costs), any of which could materially adversely affect our operations. As a result, any deterioration in our relationships with our colleagues, unions and other colleague representatives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time disagreements and other disputes may emerge with our workforce and/or their representatives and we are presently engaged in ordinary course litigation regarding dismissals, overtime work and other routine disputes or actions. See ""Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation."" We cannot assure you that a future labour disturbance, work stoppage, or failure to attract and retain operative personnel at any of our stores, depots or our suppliers' facilities in the United Kingdom or elsewhere would not have a material adverse effect on such store's or facility's operations and, potentially, on our business, results of operations and financial condition.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Our ability to recruit or adequately replace, retain and motivate suitably qualified and experienced staff is important for our ongoing success. It may in the future become more difficult for us to recruit or retain such members of staff and the UK labour market may become more competitive. An inability to recruit and retain sufficient personnel of the right calibre or the incurring of significant costs in order to do so may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and future prospects. Furthermore, our automated warehouses and delivery trucks still require intensive labour. Colleague benefits (which include wages, National Insurance contributions and other payments) currently represent one of our most significant cost items, accounting for a substantial portion of our total expenses. Consequently, our commercial success depends in part on our ability to manage our labour costs and control their impact on our margins. We may in the future be forced to raise our wages due to changes in market conditions, new labour laws and regulations, collective bargaining with our recognised trade unions or general wage increases across the industry or in any particular region in which we operate. For instance, given the high proportion of our colleagues who are hourly paid, future increases or changes to the National Minimum Wage legislation, the National Living Wage or other hourly wage legislation or regulations could have an impact on our future financial success. As of April 2020, the National Living Wage increased from £8.21 per hour to £8.72 per hour from April 2019. The National Living Wage will increase in increments with a target to be set by the UK government of reaching two-thirds of median earnings by 2024. As of October 2020, the UK government has not set out a projected pathway to the 2024 target, given the uncertainty about the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. We must comply with such legislation. Any failure to comply could result in criminal prosecution with any party found to be guilty of deliberate non-compliance being subject to disqualification as a company director for up to 15 years. From time to time, we are subject to legal proceedings in connection with the wages we pay: see ""Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation."" As national minimum hourly wage rates increase, we may be required to increase not only the wage rates of our hourly paid colleagues but also the wages of our salaried managers as an increase in hourly rates inevitably erodes the pay gap between hourly paid and first line managers. This makes it more challenging to incentivise our most talented colleagues to progress into management positions. It also makes it difficult to retain our talented managers. Although difficult to predict with certainty, these higher salaried costs could have a material adverse effect on our profitability. While we cannot be certain how this will affect our business, an increase in the minimum wage rate paid to certain workers will increase our labour costs which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to meet our management labour needs, while controlling wage and labour-related costs, is subject to numerous external factors, including the availability of and competition for qualified persons in the local markets in which we are located, unemployment levels within those markets, prevailing pay rates, changing demographics, and changes in employment and labour laws. Such laws related to hours, wages, job classification and benefits could significantly increase operating costs. ### 94 ----- If we fail to maintain our competitive position on pay and benefits, the quality of our workforce could decline, causing our customer service to suffer, while increasing wages for our colleagues could cause our profit margins to decrease. If we are unable to hire, retain, and train colleagues capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, we are required to pay social security, National Insurance contributions, pension contributions and other similar charges for our colleagues. These may increase over time or the laws and regulations setting forth any exonerations or other exemptions from payment of such charges from which we currently benefit may change, increasing our liabilities. We maintain defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans that cover current and former colleagues pursuant to which, with respect to defined benefit plans, the participants receive defined payment amounts regardless of the value or investment performance of the assets held by such plans and, with respect to defined contribution plans, the employer, employee or both make contributions on a regular basis to such plans. Deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise, could cause an increase in the underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans, thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans, which in turn would reduce the cash available for other business needs or for capital expenditures. Our main defined benefit pension plan, the ASDA Group Pension Scheme (""ASDA Group Pension Scheme""), benefits from a bulk purchase annuity policy issued by Rothesay Life plc. The policy covers all known members of the scheme and all known benefit liabilities, subject to certain exclusions. If Rothesay Life were to get into financial difficulty and default on its payment obligations under the policy, or if any of the excluded liabilities were to crystallise, this could result in a requirement for us to make further, material contributions to the ASDA Group Pension Scheme. Future contributions to our defined benefit pension plans could reduce the cash otherwise available to operate our business and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of _Operations—Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Information—ASDA Group Pension Scheme Buy-In.""_ Any of the foregoing may affect our profitability and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

If we are unable to protect and maintain our own intellectual property rights or our use of the intellectual property rights owned by others, or we are unable to renew our intellectual property rights when they expire, the value of our brands could be diminished and our competitive position could weaken.

Successful infringement claims against us could result in significant monetary liability and prevent us from selling some of our products and/or services.

Each pharmacy therefore has a responsible pharmacist to ensure it operates in a safe and legal manner and corporate-wide this responsibility is shared by the Superintendent Pharmacist. Application of laws and regulations could subject our current practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality, or could require us to make changes to our operations.

We also generate revenue through providing NHS services, private services and the sale of over the counter P Medicines. Our retail pharmacy operations are subject to numerous risks, including: changes in NHS reimbursement for prescription drugs; a reduction in the pharmacy global sum leading to reduced retained purchase margins available for pharmacy in England; a reduction in dispensing activity payments; the introduction of new NHS services; and a move away from reimbursement for dispensing prescription drugs; increased competition from other retail pharmacy operations, including online; overall economic conditions; and changes in the regulatory environment for the retail pharmacy industry and the pharmaceutical industry, and other changes in laws, rules and regulations that affect our retail pharmacy business. If the supply of certain pharmaceuticals provided by one or more of our vendors were to be disrupted for any reason, we would in turn have to seek a new supplier for such pharmaceuticals, with related risks of shortages or delays in our own pharmacy operations. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a number of our pharmacy customers transferring their prescriptions to other pharmacies. One or a combination of such factors may adversely affect the volumes of prescriptions we dispense, our cost of sales associated with our retail pharmacy operations, and the revenue and gross margin of those operations or result in the loss of cross-store selling opportunities and, in turn, affect our overall revenue, other results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

We also have an online site supplying contact lenses under ""General Direction."" The majority of our revenue is from the sale of spectacles and eye examinations. We are regulated by the General Optical Council (""GOC""). To operate in the United Kingdom and use the title ""Opticians"" we have to be registered as a Body Corporate with the GOC and therefore are subject to the GOC Business Standards as well as the Opticians Act 1989. It is a requirement of the GOC that any Body Corporates which do not have GOC registrants as the majority of their Board, must have a Responsible Officer (Superintendent Optometrist) in position. All Optometrists and Opticians also have to be registered with the GOC to be able to practice and they are subject to the GOC Professional Standards as well as the Opticians Act 1989. Breaches to the GOC standards could lead to warnings, fines, sanctions on practice up to being removed from the GOC register either as a business or individual and unable to practice. All of our optical departments also hold a contract with the NHS local area team or Health Board to be able to provide NHS services. Breaches of the terms within such contracts can lead to penalties, including up to revoking such contract and stopping us providing NHS services. These penalties can occur at the store level, regional level or national level. Since 67% of our eye examinations in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and 100% of our eye examinations in Scotland were funded by the NHS in 2020, any penalties or stoppage in NHS services would have a material adverse impact on our business. Our Optometrists in all four nations also have to be registered on an NHS performer's listing to be able to provide NHS eye examinations. In England, some of our stores also conduct additional NHS services which are commissioned at a local level, which requires such stores to abide by additional NHS standard contracts with local service level agreements. Changes in the regulatory environment for the optical industry and other changes in laws, rules, NHS contract terms and regulations may also have an effect on our operating and commercial model. The provision of professional eye care services entails an inherent risk of professional malpractice and other similar claims. We may become subject to professional malpractice regulatory or NHS actions or claims under various theories relating to the professional services provided by our departments. This could also lead to a public relations and/or reputational risk both at the local and national level. We may not be able to continue to obtain adequate liability insurance at reasonable rates, in which event, the cost could require us to exit this offering, as insurance is a regulatory requirement for both a Body Corporate and individual registrants. Furthermore, our insurance may not be adequate to cover claims asserted against us, thus, potentially decreasing our future cash position. If the glazing supply provided by of our main Optical vendor was to be disrupted for any reason, our Optical operations could be severely affected until at least such time as we could transfer to a new glazing ### 99 ----- manufacturer. Any such disruption could cause reputational damage and result in a number of our Optical customers transferring their purchases to other Opticians.

For example, from time to time, we and/or our management are involved in litigation, tax audits, claims and other proceedings related to the conduct of our business, including, but not limited to, claims from our current and former employees, claims of intellectual property infringement, claims from customers (such as for injuries at our premises), claims asserting unfair competition and unfair business practices by third parties and environmental, health and safety claims (including, for example, related to the presence of asbestos in any of our properties). We could face a wide variety of employee claims, including general discrimination, privacy, labour and employment and disability claims. ASL is a defendant in over 40,000 equal value claims (the ""Equal Value Claims"") that began in 2008 and are proceeding before an Employment Tribunal in Manchester (the ""Employment Tribunal"") in the United Kingdom on behalf of current and former ASDA store employees, and further claims may be asserted in the future. The claimants allege that the work performed by employees in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of employees working in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities, and that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in ASDA's retail stores with those of employees in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities. ASDA appealed the ruling and the oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in July 2020. We are awaiting a decision. Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims. That phase will determine whether the work performed by the claimants is of equal value to the work performed by employees in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities. At present, we cannot predict the number of such claims that may be filed, and cannot reasonably estimate any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance as to the scope and outcomes of these matters and any losses that may arise from these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. See ""Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal Value Litigation."" Any claims could result in litigation against us and could also result in regulatory proceedings being brought against us by various governmental agencies. Often these cases raise complex factual. accounting and legal issues, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and which could require significant management time and legal expenses. Litigation and claims and regulatory proceedings against us or our management could result in unexpected expenses and liability and could also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Even if we were successful in defending such proceedings, we could still suffer from the distraction of management resources to such proceedings, incur certain expenses and possibly face harm to our reputation from case-related publicity.

Moreover, some of our businesses are subject to specific regulations, compliance with each of which can be complex and costly or can result in significant cash outflows. These include compliance with marketing laws and regulations, compliance with pharmaceutical laws and regulations, compliance with optometry laws and regulations, compliance with e-commerce laws and regulations and compliance with real estate laws and regulations. Additionally, we are subject to, among other things: telecommunications regulation, both directly and indirectly; regulations that govern our relationships with our suppliers, limiting our operational flexibility; and labour and employment laws that regulate the human resources implications of any proposals to restructure our business, our colleagues' working conditions, maximum working hours and, in certain jurisdictions, the ability to have stores open 24 hours a day or work on Sundays. We may be subject to audits and/or inquiries into our labour law practices by competent authorities and enforcement costs and penalties can be significant. For example, we are subject to the Groceries Supply Code of Practice (""GSCOP""), a statute governing the largest UK food retailers which requires these retailers to treat their suppliers fairly, lawfully and in good faith. The proposed fines for breaching the legislation may be up to 1% of the breaching retailer's turnover. Even if no fines are assessed, a finding of breach by the Groceries Code Adjudicator responsible for enforcing the GSCOP may cause negative publicity and damage our image, reputation or brand, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we are subject to the Groceries Market Investigation (Controlled Land) Order 2010 (the ""Controlled Land Order""), which is legislation administered by the CMA and designed to limit the ability of large grocery retailers to prevent land being used by their competitors for grocery retailing in the future. We purchase our electricity on a wholesale basis via a dedicated subsidiary, which sells electricity back into ASDA. These electricity purchases are regulated by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (""OFGEM""), which is the government regulator for gas and electricity markets in Great Britain. In addition, we are subject to regulation by the Office of Communications (""OFCOM""), an independent regulator and competition authority for the UK communications industries, which regulates selling practices for mobile telecommunication services and changes to mobile termination rates, among other things. The FCA is responsible for the regulation of insurance and customer credit-related activities in the United Kingdom. Firms carrying on such activities in the United Kingdom must generally be authorised by the FCA with appropriate permissions, and FCA authorised firms are subject to ongoing regulation and supervision by the FCA. In connection with distributing the ASDA Money suite of white-labelled financial services products, ASL is authorised by the FCA with limited permission to carry out credit broking, and both ASL and ASDA Financial Services Limited are registered with the FCA as introducer appointed representatives of a number of third party insurance and credit product providers. Any failures in or inadequate controls around the customer introduction process for those regulated financial services products, or any technical deficiencies in the arrangements with such third party insurance and credit product providers, could in principle result in regulatory investigations and related costs and penalties, as well as reputational damage. Additionally, as a retailer and manufacturer of food products for human consumption, we are subject to stringent production, packing, health, quality, labelling and distribution standards. Each of our stores and our suppliers' facilities may be subject to licencing, reporting requirements and official quality controls by numerous governmental authorities. Difficulties in obtaining or failure to obtain the necessary licences or approvals could delay or prevent the development or operation of a given retail location or distribution centre. Our stores and our distribution centres are subject to regular inspection by authorities for compliance with hygiene regulations applicable to the sale, storage and manufacturing of foodstuffs and the traceability of genetically modified organisms, meats and other raw materials. Should any noncompliance with such regulations be discovered during an inspection, authorities may temporarily shut down the store, distribution centre or facility concerned and/or result in prosecution and the imposition of a fine for such non-compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ### 101 ----- Further, we are subject to various environmental and health and safety requirements, including those governing discharges to water and air, waste disposal, the clean-up of contaminated sites, product content and labelling and worker health and safety. We could incur substantial costs, including clean-up obligations, fines, penalties and other criminal and civil sanctions, and third-party claims for personal injury or property damage, as a result of violations of our liabilities under these requirements. For example, we own and operate service stations, which include significant storage of petrol or other hazardous materials, and many of our sites store fuel for use in backup generators and, as a result, we are subject to a variety of legislation governing the use, management, storage and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes and other regulated materials, such as petroleum and petroleum products, and any environmental impacts from current or historical operations at such locations. Our operations and facilities also require permits and authorisations under environmental, health and safety requirements, which are subject to renewal, modification and rescission by issuing authorities. We also may be required to incur substantial capital or other costs to comply with such requirements or those that are promulgated in the future. In addition, we could be sued for health problems caused by the use of tobacco products. In fact, various health related legal actions, proceedings and claims arising out of the sale, distribution, manufacturing, development, advertising and marketing of cigarettes have been brought against vendors of tobacco products in the United States. If this trend progressed to the United Kingdom, any unfavourable verdict against us in a health-related suit could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. From time to time, we may be notified of or otherwise become aware of additional laws and regulations that governmental organisations or others may claim should be applicable to our business. Compliance with future requirements could result in substantial costs to us. Failure to comply with any such laws or regulations could subject us to sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Future changes in such laws and regulations could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The laws and regulations to which we are subject frequently change, which may materially impact our business operations, and our failure to comply with such laws can result in significant fines and other penalties. See also ""—The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union may lead to increased _costs and potential staff shortages, adverse currency impacts and increased regulatory burden."" As a_ general matter, legal requirements are subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. Failure to define clear roles and responsibilities or to regularly communicate with and train our colleagues may result in noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. As is the case for other retailers of our size, we may from time to time be subject to inquiries or investigations from regulatory bodies by local authorities, competition authorities or financial regulators, in the ordinary course of our business. Such authorities may take the view that we have not conducted or are not conducting our business fully in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and, consequently, we may be required to make significant expenditures to defend against allegations of wrongdoing or modify our business practices to comply with differing interpretations of existing laws and regulations or with future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business.

Any failure or perceived failure by us or any of our third-party service providers to comply with our policies or with any other privacy related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations could materially adversely affect our reputation and brands and may result in claims, fines (including by card merchants), civil or criminal proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. For example, we are subject to the GDPR which became applicable on May 25, 2018. The GDPR strengthens existing rights, provides for new rights and gives customers and colleagues increased control over their personal data, including the requirement for data collectors to process and use personal information solely for the reasons for which they were collected. Laws, such as the GDPR, restrict our ability to collect and use personal information relating to individuals including the use of that information for marketing purposes. We rely on our own colleagues to maintain our databases and seek to ensure that procedures are in place to ensure compliance (including that we maintain proper privacy notices). Non-compliance with the GDPR could result in a possible fine of up to either EUR 20,000,000 or 4% of total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, for the most serious infringements.

We typically renew our insurance on an annual basis. In connection with this renewal process, our insurance costs may increase following the occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages, in response to any negative development in our claims history or due to material price increases in the insurance market in general. The occurrence of several events resulting in substantial claims for damages in a calendar year may have a material adverse effect on our insurance premiums.

Opinions of pricing of property (including those used in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing) are prepared on the basis of various assumptions, estimates and projections. In particular, the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing were produced without visual inspection of ASDA's properties and are thus based on information provided by management and certain assumptions, including, but not limited to, the assumptions that (i) in the case of Newsteer, the properties are let to ASL and in the case of Colliers, the properties are let to ASDA or to a AAA-tenant, which could include ASDA, and in both cases that ASDA is in the market for all the properties and benefits from an excellent rating, such as AAA and a very low risk of failure, (ii) all properties are freehold or long leasehold and all title, tenure, lettings, planning, taxation, statutory and local authority requirements are complied with and all properties possess a good and marketable title free from any onerous restrictions or conditions, (iii) all properties benefit from full access and egress rights together with parking and loading facilities and are connected to all main services, (iv) all properties are free from defect, in good repair and condition and well maintained and in marketable condition, compliant with all building, accessibility and fire safety regulations and there are no abnormalities as to repair and condition of the properties, (v) the properties have no environmental issues such as contamination, deleterious materials, flooding, ground conditions, invasive or protected plants or species and the properties are not adversely affected by any existed or proposed environmental law, and (vi) the floor areas provided to Newsteer and Colliers by ASDA comply with the RICS Standards for measurement (other than those properties which were measured by Colliers as part of separate instruction and upon which Colliers have relied for the purposes of their opinion on pricing) and (vii) no capital expenditure is required in respect of the properties. Both Colliers and Newsteer have assumed that each property is a vacant shell unit which benefits from fully capped off services and no tenant fit-outs or fixtures and fittings beyond a typical specification with which a vacant shell unit would be let or sold have been taken into account in the respective broker's opinion of pricing. In addition, during the course of their engagement, Newsteer and Colliers did not perform site inspections, environmental audit, tests of services and amenities, investigations or tests as to the condition of the properties. Newsteer and Colliers did not make planning or permitting inquiries and did not examine deeds, leases or other documents relating to the title to our properties. The real estate advisers both assumed each property to be used to its respective authorised use under planning legislation and in accordance with the use registered with the relevant regulatory agency. We cannot assure you that the assumptions or projections used, estimates made or procedures followed in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing are correct, accurate or complete. Newsteer and Colliers provided their opinions of pricing on the relevant properties as of October 20, 2020 and do not take into account subsequent events, including the uncertain impacts of COVID-19 after such date. Accordingly, the information included in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing may not reflect the current physical, economic, competitive, market or other conditions with respect to the property portfolio. Furthermore, the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing are addressed to the Issuers only and Newsteer and Colliers have accepted no responsibility to any third party for the whole or any part of the contents of the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing. Other appraisers may reach different opinions on pricing of ASDA's property portfolio. Moreover, the pricing determined in the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing could be significantly higher than the amount that would be obtained from the actual sale of the properties included in the ASDA Property Portfolio, especially in a distressed or liquidation scenario, in the event of a downturn in the local, regional or national real estate market, or if the properties are sold on an individual basis. Accordingly, the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing should not be considered a representation of the actual present or future pricing of ASDA's property portfolio. The realisable pricing of the applicable property portfolio at any given time will depend on various factors, including: - macroeconomic conditions in the United Kingdom, the European Union and elsewhere; - an economic downturn, including as a result of COVID-19; - potential changes to the competitive landscape for grocery retail; - capital expenditure requirements; ### 106 ----- - changes in occupier and investor demand; - supply and demand generally affecting pricing; - adaptability or obsolescence; - regulation (e.g. minimum energy efficiency standards); - changes in consumer behaviour and shopping habits, either organic or as a result of any other event listed above or elsewhere under ""Risk Factors;"" and - other factors discussed or referred to in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, we anticipate that the price of ASDA's property portfolio will change over time, and it may change materially. After the issuance of the Notes, neither third parties nor we will provide holders of the Notes with revised brokers' opinions of pricing and we expressly disclaim any duty to update such brokers' opinions of pricing under any circumstance.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

As such, you should not place reliance on them when making an investment decision. We have included data for the months of October and November 2020 in order to provide information about our recent performance but this information should be treated with a higher level of caution for reasons including but not limited to the fact that management accounts are not prepared with the same level of rigor and are not subject to the same level of management review and scrutiny as interim or yearend financial information. In addition, we prepare our monthly management accounts, including those for the months of October and November 2020, in accordance with Walmart's accounting policies, which may differ materially from U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and/or IFRS, in accordance with which we have prepared the Financial Statements and certain other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum. Furthermore, management accounts may not provide for closing procedures that are as detailed as those conducted at period or year end. Additionally, management accounts may be subject to cut-off errors and misallocation of items between months.

Effective internal and disclosure controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to operate successfully as a business. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal controls. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the system are met. In addition, the design of any control system is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events. Because of these and other inherent limitations of control systems, there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote. If our internal controls do not keep pace with the size and sophistication of our businesses and the applicable financial reporting framework, we may not be able to implement and maintain adequate internal controls. If we fail to implement and maintain effective internal controls, it could result in material misstatements in our financial statements or failure to meet our reporting obligations in a timely manner, which may cause a loss of confidence in our reported financial information which could increase our operating costs and materially impair our ability to operate our business. ### 107 ----- Moreover, we may acquire companies or assets which we determine to be complementary to our current business.

We have recorded a significant amount of goodwill. Total goodwill, which represents the difference between the consideration paid plus any non-controlling interest and the acquisition date fair value of identifiable net assets, was £508.0 million as of September 30, 2020, or 2.8% of our consolidated total assets on a post-IFRS 16 basis.

The value of any goodwill recorded on our financial statements may not be fully realisable upon sale of all or part of the business or any other liquidity event. Goodwill is recorded on the date of acquisition and, in accordance with IFRS, is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is any indication of impairment.

While consummation of the Acquisition is expected to take place on or about February 16, 2021, the CMA's phase 1 review of the Acquisition remains ongoing. There can be no assurance that the Acquisition will be approved within the expected timeframe, approved at all, or approved subject to conditions. If in the course of its phase 1 investigation, the CMA considers that the Acquisition may be expected to result in a substantial lessening of competition within any market or markets for goods or services in the United Kingdom, the CMA may refer the Acquisition for an in-depth phase 2 investigation. It is common practice in such circumstances to propose remedies to address any concerns identified by the CMA, in lieu of proceeding with a full phase 2 inquiry. Such remedies may include an undertaking to sell certain Forecourt Assets, to unaffiliated third parties. In the event we propose remedies to the CMA following their phase 1 investigation, there can be no assurance that our proposal will be accepted. The CMA may reject our proposal, require additional divestments or impose terms or other conditions that we may be unable or unwilling to accept. If we are unable to reach an agreement with the CMA concerning remedies in lieu of a referral to a phase 2 investigation and the Acquisition is so referred, the CMA Clearance Date could be significantly delayed. If we agree to remedies that require divestment of certain Forecourt Assets to unaffiliated third parties, the price we receive from such a mandated sale may be less than what we would have received in a fully voluntary sale process. There can be no guarantee that market conditions would be favourable in the period provided for such sales or that the price we would obtain from buyers in a mandated sale would be equal to the price that would otherwise be offered as part of a customary sales process. If we agree to remedies that require divestments but are unable to complete these transactions on acceptable terms in the time permitted, we would be in breach of our agreement with the CMA, which could result in loss in control over the divestment process or other consequences that could have a material adverse effect on our business. If the CMA believes the Acquisition may implicate a material public interest consideration, it is required to bring the matter to the attention of the UK Secretary of State. Under certain circumstances, the UK Secretary of State may issue a Public Interest Intervention Notice (""PIIN""), which would allow the UK ### 108 ----- Secretary of State to assume responsibility for review of the Acquisition. If a PIIN is issued in connection with the Acquisition, the CMA Clearance Date could be delayed. In the event the CMA refers the Acquisition to a phase 2 investigation, it has broad authority to impose remedies to address their concerns. In the event the CMA considers that remedies would not address their concerns, the CMA may decide not to approve the Acquisition. If this were to occur, the entire ASDA Group would have to be divested to unaffiliated third parties. The price we receive from such a mandated sale may be less than what we would have received in a fully voluntary sale process. There can be no guarantee as to the consideration we would obtain from buyers in a mandated sale and, in such an event, there may be insufficient funds for the Notes to be repaid. In connection with the CMA's review of the Acquisition, we expect the CMA to issue an IEO shortly before or immediately after Completion, and we expect the IEO to remain in force until the CMA Clearance Date. Under the IEO, the ASDA Group business will have to be operated independently so as not to take any action that could potentially impede the CMA's review and remediation of Acquisition-related competition concerns. In addition, the IEO will prevent any integration activities, substantive changes to the organisational structure of the ASDA Group, dispositions of ASDA Group assets and exchanges of commercially sensitive information between the ASDA Group and the Bellis Group unless we seek and obtain a derogation from the CMA. As a result of the IEO, the Bellis Group will not be able to exercise de _facto control over the ASDA Group during the pendency of the CMA investigation. Accordingly, the Issuers_ will not be able direct the ASDA Group to comply with the covenants described in ""Description of the Senior _Secured Notes"" and ""Description of the Senior Notes"" until the CMA Clearance Date, and the ASDA Group_ will have no contractual obligation to comply with those covenants until each of the ASDA Guarantors accedes to the relevant Indenture. Nevertheless, those covenants will apply to the ASDA Group from the Issue Date, and any failure to comply with these covenants will constitute a default under the Indentures. Furthermore, subject to any derogations granted, the IEO's restrictions on the ability to exchange information with the ASDA Group may limit the support that the Bellis Group may be able to provide to the ASDA Group and affect our ability to grant and creditors' ability to enforce guarantees and security interests for so long as the IEO is in force. As a result, there may be a delay in our ability to realise anticipated synergies. If we fail to abide by the terms of the IEO, the CMA may impose financial penalties of up to 5% of our total turnover. The CMA may appoint a monitoring trustee to monitor compliance with the IEO and, if it were ultimately to consider it to be necessary, the CMA may appoint a hold separate manager to operate the ASDA Group on an arm's-length basis until the CMA Clearance Date.

1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,Risks Relating to the Transactions,13.5.3,There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart.,"The Separation is a complex transaction that will require significant management attention and poses a number of risks, including: - a failure to establish or maintain our own information systems; - a failure to establish and negotiate new wholesale energy supply agreements; - a failure to establish or negotiate new deep sea freight agreements; - our inability to renegotiate key contracts previously held at the Walmart level; - our inability to renegotiate key insurance policies previously held at the Walmart level; - our inability to retain key personnel of ASDA; - the incurrence of unexpected expenses and working capital requirements; - our inability to achieve our financial and strategic goals, including synergies for the combined businesses; and - difficulty in maintaining internal controls, procedures and policies. Any of the foregoing obstacles, or a combination of them, could decrease operating profit margins or increase operating costs in absolute terms and/or as a percentage of revenue, which could in turn negatively impact our profit for future periods and cash flows. Following the Acquisition, Walmart will continue to provide a reduced selection of services to ASDA, including services such as IT and access to innovation and know-how under the TSA and the ASA, for a transitional period (envisaged to be up to three years from the Acquisition Completion Date in respect of services under the TSA (although the TSA is expected to allow for services to be provided past this date subject to an increase in costs under a cost ratchet), and for a period of two years from the Acquisition Completion Date, in respect of the services under the ASA). ASDA expects that it will be dependent on these services provided by Walmart, for the duration of the agreements pursuant to which they will be provided. For more information see ""Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional _Agreements with Walmart."" At Completion, Walmart will grant ASDA a licence pursuant to the TMA to use_ the George brand within the United Kingdom (for sale, marketing and distribution purposes on an exclusive basis) and outside the United Kingdom in certain European countries where ASDA has used the George brand prior to the date of the Acquisition Agreement (on a non-exclusive basis) (and is expected to grant ASDA a licence to use the George brand in certain other territories outside the United Kingdom and such specified European countries (on a non-exclusive basis) in substantially the same way and to the same extent as the brand was used by ASDA immediately prior to the date of the Acquisition Agreement, as specified in, and subject to the terms of, the TMA), in each case on and subject to the terms of the TMA (see ""Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions – Trade Mark Agreement""), while Walmart will continue to own the brand and retain the ability to use it in all other territories. See ""Business—Our _Intellectual Property.""_ We will have ongoing service relationships and agreements with Walmart pursuant to which Walmart has provided certain services to ASDA in the past. These services include sourcing of clothing and general merchandise. It is possible that such ongoing service relationships and agreements will be insufficient to cover our needs as a stand-alone company or that the agreements pursuant to which they are provided may contain terms and conditions that are not favourable to ASDA or not competitive with alternatives in the market. In addition, failure by Walmart to perform the services provided for under the service arrangements and agreements to an acceptable service level or at all may result in operational problems and increased costs to ASDA. The services to be provided by Walmart after the Acquisition may not function as efficiently as they did prior to the Acquisition and, in the event any of our service relationships and agreements with Walmart are terminated, ASDA may find it difficult to find a suitable alternative supplier of such services in a timely fashion or at all. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. As a result of the commercial deleveraging resulting from the Separation, we may not have the same ability to negotiate with third-parties and achieve the same or similar terms as under existing agreements through Walmart. We may have substantially higher costs if we fail to negotiate new agreements on similar terms or at all. ### 110 ----- In addition, the Acquisition will constitute a change of control under certain agreements entered into by ASDA and its subsidiaries. Those counterparties will be entitled to terminate their agreements with us. Some of these counterparties may exercise their termination rights, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations. The benefits of the operational improvements that we plan to make following the Acquisition may be undermined by certain other risks we face in our day-to-day operations, including, among other things, the loss of key contracts, customers and suppliers and strikes and other industrial actions by our colleagues, which could result in disruptions to our operations and increased costs. Operational efficiency measures generally require a significant amount of management attention and resources, which may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our ongoing business operations. These factors may offset any cost savings we anticipate and which we have included in our _Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA. Consequently, our inability to realise any anticipated cost savings could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.5,Risks Relating to the Transactions,13.5.4,The ASDA Group will need to transition to being a standalone company and there are risks associated with such a transition.,"The ASDA Group has historically been part of the operations of Walmart, which provided them with operational, financial, and other support. As a result of the Acquisition, we became a standalone company and, accordingly, we must develop and implement the systems and infrastructure necessary to support our current and future business. We cannot assure you that we will make the transition successfully. For example, historically, certain of our accounting and information technology systems were incorporated in Walmart's larger operations. There can be no assurance that there will not be errors, delays, or other related issues resulting from the transition to a standalone company and adjustments to associated business processes or that we will be able to fix any error or issue. Any such errors or issues could have a material and adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any delays in implementing required systems may lead to increased operating expenses. On the Acquisition Completion Date, ASL and Walmart are expected to enter into the TSA, under which Walmart is expected to provide certain information technology services to ASDA on a transitional basis (the ""Transitional Services""). The Transitional Services, which Walmart is expected to agree to provide to support and facilitate our ability to operate on a standalone basis, cover all information technology services and telecommunication services that were provided to ASDA in the 12 months prior to the Acquisition Completion Date. Under the TSA, each relevant Transitional Service is expected to be supplied by Walmart until the earlier of (i) the migration of the relevant service as part of the separation of ASDA from Walmart, and (ii) the termination of the TSA by Walmart or ASL under certain circumstances as described under ""Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions—Transitional Agreements with _Walmart—Transitional Services Agreement."" (provided that where ASDA requires any Transitional_ Services to be provided after a three-year long stop date set out in the TSA, the charges for such remaining Transitional Services under the TSA will be subject to increase pursuant to a cost ratchet). If Walmart terminates the TSA in accordance with its terms or is unable or unwilling to provide the Transitional Services as agreed, we may not be able to replace these services at an acceptable price and in a timely manner, or at all. The Transitional Services include certain IT services which are provided pursuant to third-party vendor contracts. These services will require the vendor consent to extend the term of the underlying agreement past the Acquisition Completion Date, and thereafter will have to be renegotiated with the IT vendor. We may not be able to successfully transition these systems to our standalone operations in a timely manner, or at all, or may have underestimated the costs required to do so. Any delays in implementing required functionalities and systems may lead to increased operating expenses. We will also incur costs in the future that have historically been part of Walmart's larger cost structure, including costs associated with health and welfare benefits for our colleagues, as well as internal legal, tax, regulatory and treasury services. In particular, we will need to bear the cost of hiring additional colleagues to fill any gaps left by the withdrawal of Walmart services. We will incur costs searching for and hiring individuals to fill the positions, and we may not be able to find qualified candidates at a reasonable cost, or at all. Additionally, as part of Walmart, we benefited from certain economies of scale, including with respect to our relationships with our suppliers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain or build the independent relationships that are necessary for us to continue to benefit from such economies of scale or operate our business successfully. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that the estimated costs to operate as a standalone company will be consistent on a forward-looking basis. Any failure to transition successfully within the terms of the applicable Transitional Agreement(s), or to otherwise transition successfully to a standalone company, may cause us to incur substantial expenses in addition to the anticipated separation costs, and would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ### 111 ----- Further, becoming a standalone company will require a significant amount of management's time and effort, which may divert management's attention from operating and growing our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that are expected from becoming a standalone company, or do not achieve them in the time frame expected, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

If such funds are not sufficient, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower is expected to supplement the proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions with additional proceeds from the transfer of some or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the Substitute Retail Assets in sale transactions with unaffiliated third parties. The initial maturity date for the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is one year from the Acquisition Completion Date, and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower has the option to extend its term by an additional six months at its sole discretion. While we expect the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower or Propco 2, as applicable, will be able to complete the Warehouse Sale Transactions within that timeframe, changes in market conditions, unanticipated obstacles, weaker than expected demand or other factors could delay or prevent completion of some or all of these transactions. If the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower is unable to complete the Warehouse Sale Transactions on favourable terms before the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility matures, it may elect to sell some or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the Substitute Retail Assets rather than accept unfavourable terms for the Warehouse Sale Transactions or refinance the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility through alternative means. If the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower or Propco 2, as applicable, elects to sell any or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, any or all of the Substitute Retail Assets (in each case subject to the ASDA Leases), these assets will not be contributed back to the Group, and we will continue to incur expenses related to the ASDA Leases entered into in respect of such Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets for the duration of the ASDA Lease. Moreover, the terms of the relevant sale transactions and the ASDA Leases may constrain our use of any such Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets, which could have an adverse effect on our business. The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower is not a subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Issuer, and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower will not be party to the Indentures. Although the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower and Propco 2 are under common control, we will not be able to directly compel them (or Topco or any of our other relevant non-controlled affiliates) to comply with the covenants described in ""Description of the Senior ### 112 ----- _Notes—Certain Covenants—Topco Covenant"" and ""Description of the Senior Secured Notes—Certain Covenants—Topco Covenant"" or direct their negotiations with potential purchasers in connection with the_ Warehouse Sale Transactions or in connection with a sale of any Select Retail Assets or Substitute Retail Assets (in each case subject to the ASDA Leases).

The objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities, to identify possible risks associated with that investment, including actual or potential liabilities, and to prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation. In conducting due diligence in connection with the Acquisition, the Shareholders also relied on resources available to them, including ### 114 ----- public information, information provided by the ASDA Group and its former owners and information provided by third-party advisers, including in the preparation of this Offering Memorandum. When conducting due diligence, the Shareholders typically evaluate a number of important business, financial, tax, accounting, environmental and legal issues in determining whether or not to proceed with an investment. Outside consultants, legal advisors, accountants and investment banks are involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment. Nevertheless, when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment, the Shareholders must rely on resources available to them, including information provided by the target of the investment and, in some circumstances, third-party investigations. The ASDA Group may have liabilities that the Shareholders failed or were unable to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations in connection with the Acquisition. Following the Acquisition, we may learn of additional information about the ASDA Group that adversely affects us, such as unknown or contingent liabilities and issues relating to compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on the business of the ASDA Group, or on the financial condition and results of operations of the ASDA Group and our ability to fulfil our obligations under the Notes.

Furthermore, there can be no assurance as to the adequacy or accuracy of information provided during the due diligence exercise or that such information will be accurate or remain accurate in the period from the conclusion of the due diligence exercise until Completion. The due diligence process is inherently subjective. If the due diligence investigation failed to identify or appreciate material information regarding the Acquisition, we may later be forced to write down or write off certain assets, significantly modify the business plan for the ASDA Group or incur impairment or other charges.

However, we may not be able to realise all of the cost savings we expect to achieve. The Shareholders ### 115 ----- have estimated that we will be able to achieve additional annual cost savings by pursuing a number of improvements identified during diligence. However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully realise the expected benefits of these initiatives or that the costs to achieve these cost savings will not be higher than anticipated. A variety of risks could cause us not to realise some or all of the expected benefits. These risks include, among others, higher than expected standalone overhead expenses, delays in the anticipated timing of activities related to such initiatives, increased difficulty, and cost in establishing ourselves as a standalone company, lack of sustainability in cost savings over time, unexpected costs associated with operating our business, inability to eliminate duplicative back-office overhead or redundant selling and general and administrative functions and inability to avoid labour disruptions in connection with any integration of the foregoing. Our ability to successfully manage organisational changes is important for our future business success. In particular, our reputation and results of operations could be harmed if colleague morale, engagement, or productivity decline as a result of organisational or other changes. The adjustments to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA annualising the impact of the removal of Walmart royalties and IT costs and their replacement with new costs under the TSA with Walmart, other adjustments including the impact of the 2020 leap year and estimated costs relating to ASDA operating as a standalone group, one-off net impact of costs and benefits associated with COVID-19 and adjustment for certain anticipated cost savings, EG foodservice partnership synergies, synergies from the roll-out of the ASDA wholesale convenience business, the EBITDA associated with the Forecourt Assets and the Excluded Forecourts and the rent associated with the Warehouse Assets and Select Retail Assets should be treated with caution when making an investment decision. The assumptions we have made with respect to Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA that we present in this Offering Memorandum are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such adjusted financial information. Moreover, our implementation of these initiatives may disrupt our operations and performance, and our estimated cost savings from these initiatives are based on several assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we will realise these cost savings. If, for any reason, the benefits we realise are less than our estimates, or our improvement initiatives adversely affect our operations or cost more or take longer to implement than we project, or if our assumptions prove inaccurate, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. These actions may not provide the expected benefits and could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of or inability to recruit key personnel, decline in colleague productivity, weakening of internal standards, controls or procedures, and impairment of key customer and supplier relationships. In addition, cost saving and operational efficiencies from improved production processes may not be able to be sustained due to changes in customer needs, changes in regulations, availability and cost of materials or other cost variables. Our anticipated cost saving and operational run-rate synergies are based upon assumptions about our ability to implement cost saving measures in a timely fashion and within certain cost parameters. Our ability to achieve planned cost saving and operational run-rate synergies is dependent upon a significant number of assumptions, some of which may be beyond our control, including the development of the markets for our products and services, political, legal, fiscal, market and economic conditions, regulatory developments, and tariff and wage increases. If one or more of our underlying assumptions regarding these measures proves to have been incorrect, these efforts could lead to substantially higher costs than planned and we may not be able to realise fully or at all, or realise in the anticipated timeframe, the expected benefits from our cost saving and operational measures.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral, as well as the ability of the Security Agent to realise or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements, statutory liens or characterisation under the laws of certain jurisdictions. Enforcement of the Security Interests by the Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realisation of security interests in collateral. For example, under English law, the enforcement of share pledges, whether by means of a sale or an appropriation, is subject to certain specific requirements. The share pledges will be enforced by the Security Agent. The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Senior Secured Notes Trustee or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes to instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action. Initially, the Security Agent will not be required to take enforcement action unless instructed to do so by an Instructing Group with a sufficient majority. The Security Agent may also need to obtain the consent of a third party to enforce a security interest. The Group cannot assure you that the Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consents when required to facilitate a sale of, or appropriate or otherwise foreclose on, the Collateral. For example, any change in the direct or indirect control of ASL will require the approval of the FCA.

In addition, following allegations of manipulation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of the daily Euro Interbank Offered Rate (""EURIBOR"") or the calculation of LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. In addition, LIBOR, EURIBOR and other interest rates or other types of rates and indices which are deemed to be ""benchmarks"" are the subject of recent and ongoing national and international and other regulatory reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and the new European regulation on indices used as benchmarks in financial instruments and financial contracts or to measure the performance of investment funds, which entered into force on June 30, 2016. Following the implementation of any such reforms, the manner of administration of benchmarks may change, with the result that they may perform differently than in the past, or benchmarks could be eliminated entirely, or there could be other consequences which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 (the ""FCA Announcement""). The FCA Announcement and a subsequent speech by the Director of Markets and Wholesale Policy at the FCA on January 28, 2019 indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed, and market participants should not rely on its publication, after 2021. In July 2019, the Chief Executive Officer of the Financial Conduct Authority commented that the market should prepare for the end of LIBOR. The potential elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which EURIBOR or LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt or hedging linked to such benchmark. If LIBOR or EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt. Any such change, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the Group's ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The Purchaser, a limited company formed under the laws of Jersey, is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuers. It was formed by the Shareholders solely for the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement and has not commenced any operations, other than as set forth in the Acquisition Agreement. Pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement, the consideration payable by the Purchaser on the Acquisition Completion Date will be £6,614.0 million (assuming an Acquisition Completion Date of February 16, 2021) (the ""Purchase Consideration"").

On December 21, 2020, the Company approved a distribution of £1,769.5 million to ASDA Holdings UK Limited, of which £1,269.5 million was a distribution in specie through the transfer of intercompany receivables and £500.0 million was settled in cash. On the Acquisition Completion Date, the Company will settle outstanding intercompany payables due by the ASDA Group to Walmart Group Companies in cash.

To the extent any part of a Substitute Retail Asset or a Select Retail Asset comprises a Forecourt Asset, following the CMA Clearance Date, if documents are agreed by such date, that part of the ASDA Lease which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be surrendered (or, as applicable, renounced) and any security affecting that part of the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be released such that the intention is for the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset to be transferred to Propco 2 or its affiliates (to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility) to exclude the title to the Forecourt Asset which will be retained by ASDA by way of a Forecourt Assets Separation. If any relevant Substitute Retail Asset or Select Retail Asset remains held by the ASDA Group at the time of the Forecourt Business Disposal, that part of the ASDA Lease which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be surrendered (or, as applicable, renounced) and any security affecting that part of ### 140 ----- the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset which comprises the Forecourt Asset will be released and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will permit the disposal of the Forecourt Asset pursuant to the terms of the Forecourt SPA by way of a Forecourt Assets Separation such that the remaining part of the Substitute Retail Asset or the Select Retail Asset excludes the title to that Forecourt Asset. After the Forecourt Business Disposal has been completed, (to the extent the Post-Completion Disposals were made to Propco 2, rather than to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, following the CMA Clearance Date) we expect Midco 2 to transfer Bellis Select Warehouse Holdings Limited (""Propco",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,91,THE TRANSACTIONS,91.4,"1"") to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, in consideration of repayment of the",91.4.1,Forecourt Disposals,"On February 3, 2021, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and Bellis Forecourts Limited entered into the Forecourt SPA, whereby the Senior Secured Notes Issuer undertook to sell to Bellis Forecourts Limited the share capital of Acquisition 2 or any other member of the Bellis Group or a member of the ASDA Group that holds the Forecourt Business, directly or indirectly, following the Acquisition Completion Date, the CMA Clearance Date and completion of the acquisition by Acquisition 2 (or such other company) of the Forecourt Business. Pursuant to a separate agreement, the EG Forecourt SPA, entered into on or about the same date, Property Newco agreed to sell to Euro Garages Limited the share capital of Holdco (owning in turn Bellis Forecourts Limited and therefore the Forecourt Business) promptly upon closing under the Forecourt SPA. Property Newco may assign such separate agreement to the shareholders (i.e., Optima Group S.à r.l. and Able Holdings Limited), who may sell Property Newco itself, rather than Holdco or one of its subsidiaries. In preparation for, and prior to, the closing of the Forecourt SPA, we expect that ASDA will distribute the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as soon as practicable following the CMA Clearance Date. In order to effect the distribution of the Forecourt Business to Acquisition 2 as a dividend in kind, ASDA will have to arrange for the separation of the freehold or leasehold title to its co-located forecourts (comprising the vast majority of the Forecourt Assets) from the parent title currently comprising adjacent store or retail assets or sites by way of a Forecourt Assets Separation and the entities within the ASDA Group that currently hold non-co-located Forecourt Assets will need to distribute such assets to Acquisition 2. We expect that the process of effecting these title separations and distributions to take several months following the Acquisition Completion Date. The headline enterprise value established under the Forecourt SPA, subject to customary working capital adjustments, is £750 million, less the aggregate value of any Excluded Forecourts (and of any other assets relating to the Excluded Forecourts). The consideration will be left outstanding at the closing of the Forecourt SPA (the ""Forecourt Disposal Receivable"") and we expect it to be ultimately settled in cash and in full promptly following the closing of the EG Forecourt SPA. See ""Certain Relationships and Related _Party Transactions—Forecourt SPA."" The parties may decide to novate and assign the Forecourt SPA to_ another member of the Bellis Group or a member of the ASDA Group (as seller) and to a member of the EG Group (as buyer), in which case the separate agreement between Property Newco and Euro Garages Limited would be terminated and the Forecourt Business (or a holding company thereof) would be sold directly to EG Group by the ASDA Group. The IEO that is expected to be issued by the CMA will not permit us to sell any Forecourt Assets pursuant to the Forecourt SPA for so long as the IEO remains in force. Consequently, we do not expect to consummate the Forecourt Business Disposal before the CMA Clearance Date. The Forecourt SPA requires us to complete the transactions contemplated thereunder as soon as reasonably practicable following the satisfaction of the conditions precedent stipulated in its terms, which include the IEO to be issued by the CMA ceasing to be in effect. The CMA's investigation of the Acquisition is ongoing, and we may be required to take remedial action to address any competition-related concerns the CMA may identify. If remedies prove necessary, we may be required to designate certain Forecourt Assets (along with certain related assets) as Excluded Forecourts and sell them to unaffiliated third parties (the ""Excluded Forecourt Divestments""). Although we will attempt to carry out the Excluded Forecourt Divestments by way of orderly sales following a competitive sales process, there can be no assurance that the market conditions or circumstances of the Excluded Forecourt Divestments will permit such an outcome, and the price we receive for any Excluded Forecourts sold through the Excluded Forecourt Divestments may be less than what we would have ultimately received in a fully voluntary sale. In addition, third parties may have rights over the Forecourt ### 143 ----- Assets (including rights to acquire and pre-emption rights) exercisable in the event of a transfer of the Forecourt Assets (whether of the freehold or leasehold interest or of whole or part). In all such cases, the transfer of those Forecourt Assets may be significantly delayed, prevented in part or prevented entirely. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties _and risks, which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes.""_ Under the terms of the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the proceeds from the sale of both the Forecourt Business Disposal and the Excluded Forecourt Divestment must be used to repay amounts outstanding under the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility until it has been repaid in full.

If following the transfer of a Warehouse Asset, Select Retail Asset and/or Substitute Retail Asset to Propco 2 or other affiliates, the ASDA Lease granted in respect of such asset is not held by ASL, the relevant tenant is required under the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Agreement to assign the ASDA Lease to ASL with the intent that all ASDA Leases in respect of Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets held by Propco 2 or other affiliates are held by ASL. If, following the transfer of a Substitute Retail Asset to Propco 2 or other affiliates, first-ranking legal mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities which were granted over that Substitute Retail Asset are released, Propco 2 or other affiliates may transfer such Substitute Retail Asset to the ASDA Group in advance of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility being repaid in full. The initial term of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is one year from the Acquisition Completion Date, with the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower retaining an option to extend it for a further six months at its own discretion. The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has no scheduled amortisation and we intend to repay it in full ahead of maturity primarily with the net proceeds from the Warehouse Sale Transactions we expect to consummate before and after the transfer of Bellis Select Warehouse Holdings Limited to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, which would have to be applied promptly in mandatory prepayment of the facility. Depending on market conditions and expected transaction values, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower or Propco 2, as applicable, may also sell some or all of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the Substitute Retail Assets (in each case subject to ASDA Leases), the proceeds of which would also have to be applied in mandatory prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. We anticipate that the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower (or Propco 2, as may be the case) will return to the Issuers, by way of contribution to their equity, in-kind loan pursuant to a deeply subordinated instrument or repayment of Post-Completion Disposal Receivables held by the Group, any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets that it does not sell to repay the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, and, to the extent such proceeds are not used to repay amounts outstanding under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, amounts equal to any net proceeds directly or indirectly received from the sale of any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets (including any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds) (the ""Retail Assets Contributions""). After the Retail Assets Contributions have been made, we expect to distribute any remaining Post-Completion Disposal Receivables to Topco, in the amounts that remain outstanding at the time, by way of dividends in kind and anticipate that Topco would then arrange for such receivables to be extinguished by contribution to Propco 2. Subject to certain limitations, the Post-Completion Disposals and the in-kind distribution of the Post ### 142 ----- Completion Receivables will be permitted by the Indentures and the Senior Facilities Agreement notwithstanding the restrictive covenants or other terms that would otherwise apply to such transactions.

We operate a significant store estate of 614 stores (excluding standalone PFSs) that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom. We also have the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). The graph below compares our total grocery market share with that of other major UK grocery retailers. (Source: Kantar. Based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020. *Ocado Market share shown.) We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household expenditure on food and beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through economic fluctuations. Groceries are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic. See also ""Industry."" 153 ----- One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is in turn centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to ""Every Day Low Price"" and our wholly-owned supplier, IPL, which enables us to take a vertically-integrated approach to procurement and which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and well-established George Clothing and George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers and our team of flexible and engaged colleagues. Historically, we have benefited from the support of Walmart, our former parent company. We will continue to receive support from Walmart over the next three years pursuant to the Transitional Agreements negotiated in connection with the Acquisition. For more information about the ongoing support to be provided by Walmart, please see ""Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions— _Transitional Agreements with Walmart"" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart.""_ We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue was approximately £22.9 billion (including petrol), of which approximately £2 billion was online sales, and our Adjusted EBITDA was approximately £1.2 billion (including petrol). The chart below presents the breakdown of our 2019 revenue by product category (food, general merchandise, clothing and petrol), food category (ambient and fresh and produce) and channel (stores and online (including George.com)). (Source: ASDA information. Year ended December 31, 2019. Note: Does not include £61 million of other revenue.) Our differentiated operating model has resulted in strong financial performance: our successful financial profile is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure) and cash conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. In 2018 and 2019, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.5% (including petrol), our cumulative free cash flow was approximately £1.7 billion and our average cash conversion was approximately 70%. 154 ----- The charts below show our EBITDA Margins, Adjusted EBITDA Margins, Unadjusted Cash Conversion (""Unadjusted Cash Conversion"" is calculated as Unadjusted Free Cash Flow divided by EBITDA) and Unadjusted Free Cash Flow (""Unadjusted Free Cash Flow"" is calculated as EBITDA less capital expenditure) for the years ended December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2019 and our cash conversion and free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2019. (Source: ASDA information.) (Source: ASDA information.) We believe that our business, operating model and financial performance also benefit from our significant freehold real estate asset portfolio. See ""Brokers' Opinions of Pricing."" We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we maintain a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom. Within the UK value market, we have strong market shares across ambient products (13.0%), fresh/chilled (11.6%) and total grocery (12.2%) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). Our offer is strong across the full food basket: our 155 ----- category market shares range from 12% to 14% (except household and toiletries) (in each case in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales as of the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020, according to Kantar). We believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal ASDA data, our prices are approximately 6% to 7.5% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on a 2020 year-to-date (weeks 1-42) average, based on total goods price gap percentage). Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is supplemented by a large clothing and general merchandise business. We offer our entire range of food and non-food products to customers as a convenient ""one-stop shop"" experience that is supported and enhanced by our strong online offer. We believe our omni-channel offer, through which we reach customers at our brick-and-mortar stores, through our significant online offering and on our app, appeals to our customers. In 2020, there were approximately 9.8 million weekly visits to groceries.asda.com, with approximately 488,000 weekly orders pre-COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended February 28, 2020), and approximately 723,000 weekly orders post COVID-19 (based on the average orders for the seven days ended September 30, 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has increased use of and engagement with our online platforms and we currently fulfil approximately 720,000 online orders per week. Our online grocery business operates from 350 stores, we offer at-home delivery and customers are also able to collect their purchases at one of approximately 460 ASDA Click & Collect sites. We are also expanding our 1-hour Click & Collect offer. Our business model integrates our store-based and online offer by leveraging our stores to fulfil online orders. Our online grocery business is profitable and has been consistently gaining market share within one of the world's most developed online grocery markets. We have consistently outperformed the UK online grocery market and increased our online market share in the last three years. According to Kantar, we currently operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, holding 18.2% of market share (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) as of December 2019, which grew to 19.8% as of December 27, 2020 (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales), representing a 1.5% gain and the second-strongest share gain since December 2019 amongst our key competitors.

(Source: ASDA information.) According to Kantar, we are the second-largest online clothing retailer overall by volume in the United Kingdom and we held 6.0% of the total UK online clothing (excluding essentials, footwear and accessories) market by volume for the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020. Combined sales for our online grocery business and George.com have rapidly increased in recent years, growing from £1.7 billion (of which £1.5 billion were online grocery sales and £0.2 billion were George.com sales) in 2018 to £1.9 billion in 2019 (of which £1.6 billion were online grocery sales and £0.3 billion were George.com sales) to a total of £2.7 billion for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 (of which £2.4 billion were online grocery sales and £0.3 billion were George.com sales), representing a CAGR of 26% between 2018 and September 30, 2020. Additionally, our toyou service allows customers to conveniently collect and return orders from George.com and other partner retailers at our stores. We have partnered with 119 brands and process more than 10 million parcels per year. With our team of approximately 140,000 flexible and engaged colleagues serving approximately 15 million customers each week (based on the average of weeks 39 to 42 of 2020), we are committed to and deeply invested in the UK food supply chain. Our business model is supported by diversification. First, we are a mass market retailer that serves the entire UK population, in terms of both customer demographics and geography, with our customer base skewing slightly towards value-seeking families, younger shoppers and lower-income customers who are attracted by our Every Day Low Price strategy and with strong market shares in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. For more information about our customer mix, see ""—Our Customers,"" and for more information about the geographic distribution of our stores, see ""—Our Real Estate Portfolio."" Second, we believe we are well-positioned geographically, with a strong regional footprint across the United Kingdom. Our store footprint is strongest in the North of England, Scotland and Wales. Our large and diverse store estate offers customers a variety of differentiated shopping formats. We operate 30 supercentres, 396 superstores, 155 supermarkets and 33 ASDA Living stores. For more information on our stores, see ""— _Our Store Formats.""_ Subject to receipt of regulatory approvals, our 18 standalone PFSs and 305 co-located PFSs (including both their underlying real estate assets and their business operations) will be sold to EG Group pursuant to the Forecourt Business Disposal. However, to the extent we are required to do so in order to obtain regulatory approval for the Acquisition, we will sell all or part of our forecourt business to third parties. In addition, we will transfer to Propco 2 (or an affiliate) the real estate relating to the Warehouse Assets, and to the extent required pursuant to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets promptly following the CMA Clearance Date.

This section discusses key factors that we believe have had a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition during the periods under review, as well as those that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future. While we believe that our results of operations and financial condition, and particularly the results of operations and financial condition during the periods under review, have been primarily affected by the following key factors, these factors are not exhaustive, and the entirety of this Offering Memorandum should be reviewed, particularly the ""Risk Factors"" section. Additionally, although we believe that the underlying operating trends that have benefitted our business in recent years, as described further below, are relatively stable and will generally continue to drive relatively steady patterns of revenue and EBITDA metrics, it is difficult to predict future performance with any degree of certainty. _COVID-19_ The outbreak and spread of COVID-19 was confirmed in the United Kingdom in early 2020 and is resulting in a high level of uncertainty and disruption to UK economic, social and political activity. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in national and local authorities mandating or recommending various restrictions and other measures throughout most of 2020, including mandatory business restrictions and closures and social distancing, quarantine and lockdown measures. These restrictions and measures, which were intended to slow the spread of the virus and protect lives, have resulted in significant job losses across the United Kingdom and are expected to have serious adverse impacts on domestic and foreign 159 ----- economies for an unknown length of time. The effect of economic stabilisation efforts, including government payments, relief and other support to affected citizens, businesses and industries, as well as future lockdown and containment measures, is uncertain. While our grocery operations have been classified as an essential business in all locations in which we operate and have remained open to serve the needs of our customers since the outbreak in early 2020, our business has been, and we expect will continue to be, significantly impacted by COVID-19. The risks and uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 are broad, however below is a list of factors we consider to be relevant, based on an assessment of the principal financial impacts which have affected us since the start of the pandemic: - customer trends: changes in both the demand for our products as well as the methods in which customers procure our products, including: o a net increase in demand for groceries purchased through retail outlets during periods of national and regional lockdowns and other disruptions, given restrictions in place limiting customers' ability to purchase food from non-retail outlets, such as restaurants; o a net increase in the demand for certain categories of products, such as staple cooking ingredients and baking products, which correlate to apparent increases in at-home cooking, baking and eating by consumers; o a substantial increase in demand for and engagement with online grocery retail offerings, including both home delivery and Click-and-Collect options, as a result of government restrictions on movement and travel and customer fears of exposure to COVID-19; and o reduced customer demand for clothing lines, reflecting deteriorating consumer sentiment; - supply chain: impacts on availability of, and significant short-term increases in customer demand for, certain products, including; o supply chain risks relating to goods produced in areas of significant COVID-19 outbreak or other disruption from suppliers due to financial or operational difficulties; o periods of increased customer demand for certain staple inventory items, such as toilet paper, water, meat, beans, pasta and bread, as well as cleaning supplies and protective equipment, which have at times been, and may in the future again be, in short supply as a result of stockpiling and increased at-home consumption; and o periodic increases in inventory levels to respond to increases in demand for certain products, which may result in excess inventory, resulting in elevated working capital levels and holdings of inventory that we may be unable to sell, or have to sell at discounted prices if demand declines more abruptly than expected and which have, resulted in compensatory payments to suppliers for reduced or cancelled orders; - colleagues: incremental costs related to COVID-19 related impacts on staffing needs and compensation, including: o a significant increase in colleague absences caused by illness, quarantine or government mandates, resulting in increased overtime and other extraordinary labour costs in order to compensate for such absences; o extraordinary bonuses and other payroll increases or benefits paid to our front-line colleagues; and o additional payroll-related costs to meet increases in sales demand (particularly in order to fulfil elevated numbers of online orders) and to ensure adherence to ASDA safety initiatives, including the introduction of safety marshals across our store estate; - operational and other costs: increased operational and other costs incurred as a result of COVID 19 and measures taken in reaction thereto, as well as to protect the health and safety of customers and colleagues, including: o investments in personal protective equipment for our front-line colleagues, as well as 160 ----- enhanced and more frequent store sanitation practices, including application of antimicrobial protective coating to store trolleys and baskets; o investments in our stores to ensure adherence to safety recommendations and requirements, including placement of hand sanitising stations throughout stores, addition of Perspex screens at checkouts and kiosks and placement of additional signage and two-meter markers throughout stores to assist compliance with safety and social distancing measures; o one-off COVID-19 related costs, such as rental payment holidays granted to certain concession vendors; o charitable contributions to hunger relief to help feed families in need during the COVID19 pandemic and ensure that they get the food they need, which reflect ASDA's core principles; and o a temporary pause in our capital investment programme in order to protect customers, colleagues and suppliers during the initial phase of the pandemic. - government: impacts of government measures taken to limit the spread of COVID-19, as well as to mitigate the economic consequences of such government measures: o adverse impacts on the ASDA Group's operations and costs as a result of laws, regulations, interpretations, administrative orders, or applications, which have been and continue to be uncertain and difficult to predict. We consider that the principal risks and uncertainties associated with COVID-19 that have led, and could continue to lead, to a significant financial impact on our business relate, in particular, to product availability, colleague absence and restrictions on customers' ability to physically access stores. We have implemented measures to address these principal risks, including plans in place to protect product availability, to provide cover for increases in levels of colleague absence and to maximise access to ASDA for customers who are considered most vulnerable to the impacts of COVID-19. We believe that during the first UK lockdown, consumers strongly favoured supermarkets and convenience stores that were close to their homes as they responded to the UK government's ""stay at home"" message. During the second lockdown, we believe that the change in message from ""stay at home"" resulted in customers being willing to travel further during the lockdown, which supported footfall in out-oftown shops. As a result, we generally performed somewhat behind the market during first lockdown, which we believe was largely driven by not having a convenience offering as well as by consumer hesitation to venture far from home, while we generally performed somewhat ahead of the market during the second lockdown, which we believe reflects greater consumer willingness to return to more ordinary shopping habits as well as the appeal of one-stop shopping experiences, which we believe has benefitted us. This appeal was further supported by strong promotional and pricing activity during the second lockdown period. 161 ----- Structural shifts due to COVID-19 have led to increased overall growth in the grocery retail market. During the COVID-19 pandemic, customer behaviour has changed, with a shift away from out-of-home food consumption towards at-home food consumption, to the benefit of the UK grocery retail market. The chart below shows COVID-19-accelerated channel shifts over the periods presented. For further information on prevailing trends in the grocery retail market and, in particular, the recent channel shifts which have been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, please see ""Industry."" (Source: Kantar Worldpanel, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a year-to-date basis ended December 27, 2020.) Grocery sales have grown by 12.3% between December 1, 2019 and December 27, 2020, according to Kantar, based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales. Changes to consumer behaviour that have positively benefitted the grocery market during the COVID-19 pandemic include: increased consumption of food at home, a shift to online shopping channels, increased preference for shopping locally, in particular during the first UK lockdown (which we believe benefitted retail groups with a strong convenience store presence), and an increased focus on food safety, hygiene and health. Despite significant challenges posed by COVID-19, our business has remained resilient, supported by a well-developed online channel which saw significant growth through the government-imposed lockdowns as customer behaviour evolved. We were able to quickly increase the capacity of our online offer in response to increased demand driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, gaining market share and improving the profitability of our online business. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have benefitted from healthy revenue growth driven by higher food sales volumes (which were in turn driven by stockpiling and increased customer demand for in-home groceries via the online grocery channel), while margins contracted due to adverse changes in sales and product mix resulting from decreases in clothing sales, which impacted the George Clothing brand, the temporary closure of 33 ASDA Living stores and the shift in product mix within the food category away from higher-margin categories, such as food-to-go, and towards lower-margin categories, such as beer, wine and spirits and meat, which factors were partially offset by lower levels of promotional activity and stronger general merchandise sales. Furthermore, the George Clothing and George Home product categories generally have higher margins than our food product categories. Profitability was also adversely impacted by COVID-19-related increases in operating costs, such as the increase in retail colleague wage costs (driven by bonus payments, overtime wages and wages paid colleagues absent from work due to COVID-19, as well as wages paid to colleagues who worked during such sick colleagues' absences, rather than as a result of increased wage rates), increased cost incurred in connection with supplier goodwill compensation paid to clothing suppliers, inventory markdowns on holiday ranges, enhanced cleaning and related health and safety measures, as well as higher retail operating expenditures. We have considered the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event: the impact on future results and cash flows is difficult to estimate and we have therefore considered a range of scenarios as described in ""Accounting Policies"" of the 2019 Financial Statements. See ""Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—The impact of COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to create uncertainty in our market and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control.""_ 162 ----- We believe that some of the changes that have arisen during and in response to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting our business and the United Kingdom as a whole, will be persistent and potentially long-lasting, while others may be temporary and transient (for example, following the end of the pandemic, there may be a shift of consumer preferences to more out-of-home dining). The ultimate significance of the impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows will be dictated by the severity of the circumstances imposed as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the length of time that such circumstances continue, which will in turn depend on the currently unknowable extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and the nature and effectiveness of governmental and other actions taken in response. In March 2020, as part of a number of measures to support businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government, the Scottish government and the devolved administrations for Wales and Northern Ireland announced full relief for rates charges applicable to certain eligible commercial properties for the rates year beginning in April 2020 (and in the case of Northern Ireland, such support ended after July 2020). This relief applied to a number of properties owned or leased by the Group and as such, no rates charge has been recognised in these accounts for the period to which this relief applied. See ""Risk _Factors— Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—The impact of COVID-19 on our business and industry is significant and its effects will continue to create uncertainty in our market and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations for the foreseeable future due to many factors, most of which are beyond our control.""_ On December 3, 2020, we publicly announced that we would voluntarily pay business rates for the April 2020/21 year on the properties to which the relief applied. As rates relief was in place at September 30, 2020, no liability existed at that date and as such, our directors have concluded that the announcement on December 3, 2020 is a non-adjusting post-balance sheet event per the guidance set out in IAS 10. Discussions with the relevant local authorities relating to the timing of payment are ongoing. _Competitive Environment_ We operate in the highly competitive UK grocery retail market, which we believe is undergoing a period of significant structural change, characterised by factors such as strong growth and aggressive pricing on the part of discounters (such as Lidl and Aldi) as well as the other traditional grocers, a shift away from brick-and-mortar stores to online purchasing and the recent increase in like-for-like sales growth reported by traditional grocers, all against the backdrop of the general political and economic uncertainty, as well as the uncertain economic prospect of Brexit (including the risk that Brexit may, among other things, increase regulatory and compliance costs for imports and products shipped from mainland Great Britain to Northern Ireland, which we might pass through to customers) and the continuing COVID-19 pandemic, the latter of which has accelerated many of these trends. Across all of our market channels, we compete with grocery retailers and other operators for customers, employees, locations, products and other important aspects of our business. Our success depends on our ability to satisfy customer needs more effectively than the competition. In order to do so, we have adopted a strategy to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and compete effectively against them on product selection, quality, price, convenience of location and the overall shopping experience, among other things. Our market differentiation strategy focuses on optimising our product offerings, monitoring our mix of formats and store concepts, strengthening our brand identity through strategic partnerships and by seeking out opportunities to increase omni-channel sales. Further, our strategy is based on what we believe to be a well-established own-brand grocery offering, our large and diverse store estate that caters to our customers' different preferences and our deployment of digital tools and online platforms and innovation and a well-known and successful clothing brand, George, which was the number two clothing brand by volume of units sold (excluding essentials, footwear and accessories) in the United Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020, according to Kantar. Competition may also affect the prices we charge for our products, which in turn impacts our revenue and margins, although this is usually experienced on a product-specific basis. For example, a competitor may cut its prices to attract footfall to its stores, which in turn may require us to respond with a similar price reduction. We in turn have implemented various strategic initiatives, including our price investment in mid2020 and accompanying ""That's ASDA Price"" slogan and ""pocket tap"" PR market campaigns, investments in new product development, particularly low cost/high-quality options, and accessing the convenience market through our trial of the ASDA On the Move wholesale-convenience asset-light business model, to help us remain competitive. 163 ----- Prices for most of our products are set on a national basis and, as a result of significant structural changes to the UK grocery market, there has been substantial pressure on profit and EBITDA margins across the industry, which has led market participants to engage in intense short-term promotional activity, particularly through coupons and selective price cuts. At the same time, we have also experienced an overall market trend of food and other input price inflation. For example, increases in the UK National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage have led to grocery market wage inflation. Moreover, following the Brexit referendum, the relative value of the pound sterling has declined as compared to other relevant currencies, including the euro. As a result, we and other grocers have experienced inflationary pressures relating to food prices, as the price of non-British sourced foods, in particular, rose in sterling-denominated terms. In 2019, 45% of food consumed in the United Kingdom was imported, according to the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Overall, we believe that UK food retailers are trying to balance the retention of market share with their desire to maintain margins. We manage this input cost inflation in several ways, such as by using our bargaining power with suppliers, increasing or decreasing the prices of certain products to offset each other, through product reengineering, for example by maintaining the same price point and altering the weight or recipe, but without compromising on quality and, in certain circumstances, passing through cost increases to consumers. These changes, however, have put pressure on our profit and EBITDA margins during the periods under review and we expect moderate input cost inflation to continue during the remainder of 2020. We also monitor the competitive UK grocery retail market and trends at a regional and store concept level and react to such trends by reinforcing our market differentiation strategy, as described above, and adjusting pricing as appropriate in response to such trends. For example, consumer trends may include sustained interest (despite COVID-19) in sustainably-sourced products and plant-based eating. We also seek to identify and execute opportunities to increase our addressable market where appropriate, develop new concepts and adapt our existing formats to meet customer demand and respond to market trends. We also operate in the highly competitive UK clothing and footwear retail market through the George Clothing brand, which offers a wide variety of low cost, high-quality clothing and apparel for babies, children, men and women, including jewellery, footwear and hosiery selections. The George Clothing brand was the number two clothing brand by volume of units sold (excluding essentials, footwear and accessories) in the United Kingdom for the 52 weeks ended December 13, 2020, according to Kantar, with strong margins as compared to food categories and strong online growth in the past three years. However, we face competitive challenges in the clothing and footwear retail market, which in the first half of 2020 experienced a significant downturn as a result of decreased clothing sales relating to the COVID-19 pandemic (see ""Industry—UK Clothing and Footwear Retail Market""). Furthermore, we face competitive challenges from competitors that continue to invest in their online and in-store presence. Such competitors target some of George Clothing's key customer categories. As of September 2020, we completed a reorganisation of the George business, which was aimed at developing an agile operating model in order to enable us to retain and grow our customer base and further drive our value proposition. However, we will continue to face steep competition on the basis of, among other things, the location of our stores; our website and mobile applications, and their respective design; the breadth, quality, style, price and availability of our merchandise; and the level of customer service offered. See ""Risk Factors—Risks _Relating to Our Business and Industry—Risks Relating to Our General Operations—Competitive pressures in the apparel, footwear and homeware retail industries are high."" For a further discussion of our_ competitive landscape, market share and consumer trends in the UK grocery retail business, see ""Industry—UK Grocery Retail Market Competitive Landscape."" _General Economic Conditions in Our Geographic Markets_ Our core grocery retail business generated 85% of our total sales (excluding petrol) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and 87% of our total sales (excluding petrol) for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. The grocery retail business is generally relatively insulated from swings in demand related to general economic conditions because consumer purchases of grocery and non-grocery staples tend to be less discretionary than purchases in other retail categories. Certain of our other non-grocery offerings, on the other hand, are more correlated to discretionary spending, and therefore, are more susceptible to changes in general economic conditions. Such offerings, including George Clothing and general merchandise, generated 15% and 13% of our total sales (excluding petrol) for the year ended December 31, 2019 and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. Notwithstanding the overall resilient nature of our core grocery retail business, consumer tastes and shopping practices are affected by specific economic conditions in the local markets in which we operate, as well as, to a lesser extent, global economic conditions. Such conditions include employment levels, inflation, GDP growth, average and minimum wage levels, real disposable income, currency exchange 164 ----- rates, consumer confidence and consumer willingness to spend. For example, we believe that when consumers are confident about current and future economic conditions, our premium grocery offerings, which carry higher margins, are more likely to attract shoppers. Moreover, we believe that consumers with rising disposal incomes are more likely to make impulse purchases, which can be margin accretive and lift average basket sizes. During times of economic stress, such as during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, basket sizes may tend to decrease while frequency of trips increases. Additionally, during a recessionary environment, we may also record more purchases of our affordably-priced and attractive midtier and opening price point own-brand products relative to local and international third-party branded goods. According to data from the World Bank, the United Kingdom has some of the strongest macroeconomic indicators globally and in Europe, ranking as the sixth largest economy globally, and the second-largest in Europe by real GDP. According to the ONS, the United Kingdom's real gross domestic product (""GDP"") amounted to £2.3 trillion in 2019. According to Fitch Solutions, although the United Kingdom's GDP is projected to have declined by 9.0% in 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, GDP is expected to rebound in 2021 and return to pre-COVID-19 levels and stabilise by 2023, with an average expected GDP growth of approximately 1.7% from 2023 to 2025. Other general economic conditions in the United Kingdom have also been favourable in recent years. According to Fitch, GDP increased by 1.7%, 1.3% and 1.3% between the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, which translated into stable household expenditure on groceries. For the nine-month period ending September 30, 2020, GDP in the United Kingdom declined by approximately 8.6%, according to ONS. Average weekly household spend on food and non-alcoholic drinks as a percentage of total household spend was 10.5%, 10.6% and 10.6% between the years ended December 31, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively. For a further discussion of the macroeconomic conditions in the UK grocery retail market and the trends affecting its growth, see ""Industry."" Additionally, there are a number of ways in which Brexit could have an impact on our business, results of operations and prospects. There are two areas in which we believe the potential for Brexit impacts on our business to be most relevant: non-tariff barriers to trade and Northern Ireland. As regards non-tariff barriers to trade, we believe that delays at port could pose a significant risk relating to fresh produce imported from the EU. We believe that all of the major UK grocery operators are exposed to a similar risk in this respect. We have a port delay risk mitigation plan in place, which we also would deploy in case of other disturbance events and which we would use to re-direct shipments from Calais to other ports if needed. As regards Northern Ireland, we operate 17 stores in Northern Ireland and we are eligible for the special provisions for supermarkets as we operate in Northern Ireland only and do not have any stores in the Republic of Ireland. While ""supermarket solution"" rules have been proposed, we believe that significant bureaucratic hurdles may result. We note that the EU has granted the United Kingdom a six-month exemption from its ban on prohibited and restricted goods for products (such as minced meat) being transported into Northern Ireland. However, this means that alternative sourcing will be needed from July 2021. We also note that current proposals would require significant re-labelling and classification updates to products in order to sell in Northern Ireland. _Sensitivity of Our Cost Structure_ Excluding purchases of goods sold, we have a largely fixed cost base in the short- to medium-term, which does not fluctuate with sales volumes. Instead, our costs generally increase from period to period based on the sensitivity of certain costs to inflation. We are able to control some costs to a certain degree, such as those related to marketing and labour (via short-term contracts as well as adjustments to the number of hours our colleagues work), but must maintain sufficient sales levels to absorb the increase in our expenses in order to maintain or improve our retail margins. We have also been able to reduce overall costs by leveraging our vertically integrated procurement arm, IPL, which is a wholly-owned supplier that serves us exclusively and provides us with a cost price advantage by eliminating the ""middle man"" in our supply chain. However, even after taking such actions, certain expenses such as rent, the price of food ingredients, energy costs, energy taxes and other direct and indirect taxation are outside of our control. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business—We are vulnerable to fluctuations in the availability _and price of food ingredients commodities and packaging material, as well as to fluctuations in the price of electricity and fuel.""_ Labour costs represent a significant part of our cost structure. Whilst we can adjust the size of our workforce, where we have proposals to reduce our headcount, we have legal obligations to consult with colleague representatives (including trade unions) and engage other labour force actors before proposals can be implemented. The obligation to consult with colleague representatives may result in amendments 165 ----- to proposed reductions in headcount and therefore take time before we can implement such changes should they proceed. Additionally, we are subject to laws setting minimum wages. During the periods presented, the UK government increased the National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage, which had an impact on our cost structure and generally increased our costs, although this has been in part offset by cost saving and efficiency initiatives. In particular, as of April 2020, the National Living Wage increased from £8.21 per hour for April 2019 to £8.72 per hour. Any further increase in wages, energy, maintenance or any other input in our cost structure which is not mitigated, can also affect our results of operations. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry—Our failure to attract and retain qualified _colleagues, increases in labour costs and social charges and other changes to wage regulations could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition."" Investment in New Store Concepts and Channel and Product Innovation_ One of the drivers of our results of operations is our ability to maintain our traditional customer base and attract new customers through our ongoing investments in fulfilment capacity and development of our operations, including the evolution of our network of brick-and-mortar retail stores. Our retail store network is largely mature; however, we regularly evaluate the performance of our stores and have repositioned and remodelled stores under new store concepts to improve our customers' experience and respond to their changing preferences. For example, we have refocused capital expenditure on remodelling our existing stores, in particular to realign store space and offerings to enhance our customer proposition and better respond to customers' shopping behaviour. In October 2020, we opened our first ""sustainability store"" at our Middleton superstore location, which is a concept designed to encourage customers to reuse and refill their products, allowing customers to bring and fill their own containers with products such as coffee, rice, pasta and other goods, as well as offering second-hand clothing and increased recycling options. We generally incur initial and ongoing capital expenditure and pre-opening costs with each new grocery retail store, although these store concept improvements are expected to require a lower capital expenditure investment than the format refurbishments we have completed in the past. We are further responding to shifting customer preferences through our recent trial of the ASDA On the Move wholesale-convenience asset-light business model. We believe that this store concept will allow us to access the smaller convenience market and is responsive to changes in our customers' lifestyles. This represents our first entrance into the growing convenience market, which we have undertaken with in an asset-light approach. We have also dedicated significant investment into the expansion of our online grocery channel, ASDA Groceries, and our Click & Collect and toyou services to access new and existing customers who are increasingly shopping online, a trend that has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. We intend to continue to target operating model improvements to our online channel supported by developments in our IT infrastructure. _The Online Grocery Market in the United Kingdom_ The UK online grocery market was estimated to have a value of £7.1 billion on a Retail Value RSP basis in 2019 and has grown faster than the overall grocery market since its inception, according to PlanetRetail. We believe it will continue to grow substantially in the mid-term, fuelled by consumers shifting to online channels and at-home consumption, which have accelerated through the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe our growth has been, and we expect our growth to continue to be in the medium term, ahead of the UK online grocery market. We currently operate the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom, according to Kantar, representing 18.2% of the market (on a 52-week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales) as of December 2019, which grew to 19.8% as of December 27, 2020 (on a 52week basis, in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales), representing a gain of 154 basis points and posting the second-strongest share gain of any online grocery retailer since December 2019 and throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. See ""—Overview"" for further detail. The UK online grocery market is intensely competitive. We compete with traditional grocery retailers that are active in the online grocery retail market, including Tesco.com, Sainsburys.co.uk, Waitrose.com and Morrisons.com, as well as with new competitors in the online grocery market, including broad-reaching e-commerce companies such as Amazon, which recently began offering online grocery sales in the United Kingdom, including through its Morrisons@Amazon offering, and which expanded the rollout of its online grocery service through Amazon Prime more broadly across the United Kingdom at the end of 2020, as well as pure online players like Ocado, which has recently added Marks & Spencer food products to its grocery offerings following the creation of a joint venture between Ocado and Marks & Spencer. In order to retain our competitiveness in the evolving UK online grocery market, we continue to develop innovative customer solutions, such as our Express Collection service which enables customers to place an order for 166 ----- collection within one hour while other grocers also explore rapid delivery offerings (e.g. Ocado Zoom, Sainsbury's Chop Chop). Furthermore, we continue to invest in strategic partnerships that lead to innovation and which we believe will drive further increases in our market share, such as our partnership with Uber Eats, which provides express and last-mile delivery options for convenience groceries. See ""Business—Our Online Platform"" and ""Business—Our Tenants and Strategic Partners"" for further detail. We believe these broad-ranging online options, and in particular our in-store picking model, has bolstered, and will continue to bolster, the performance of our online channel and our ability to adapt to shifting consumer demands. _Significant Real Estate Asset Portfolio_ We are supported by a significant freehold real estate backing from properties across the United Kingdom in England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, with 71% of our retail sites being freehold (calculated as gross square footage of freehold stores as percentage of gross square footage of total stores, as of December 20, 2020; freehold percentage also includes certain properties that are freehold with a partial leasehold or which are leasehold properties for which the leases have been classed as long leasehold for the purposes of this calculation as those leases have nil or a peppercorn ground rent). We believe we currently own a greater percentage of our real estate (by square footage) than all but one of our traditional grocer peers. See ""Brokers' Opinions of Pricing"" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Financial, _Reporting and Other Matters—We cannot assure you that the projections or assumptions used, estimates made or procedures followed in the third-party brokers' opinions of pricing of our portfolio of real estate assets are correct, accurate or complete."" Accounting Treatment of Properties Used in Our Business_ In accordance with IAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment), land and buildings are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses except for certain items that were revalued to fair value prior to January 1, 2004, the date of our transition to IFRS, which are measured on the basis of deemed cost, being the revalued amount at the date of that revaluation. Items under construction are valued at cost and not depreciated. Depreciation is charged from the date that the assets are available for use. Assets acquired by way of a finance lease are stated at an amount equal to the lower of fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Following the adoption of IFRS 16, these amounts are classified as right-of-use assets. When an item is disposed of or when no future economic benefits are expected to arise from its continued use, any gain or loss arising on the derecognition of the asset is included in the income statement. _Expanding Partnerships and Taking Advantage of Synergies_ Creating a platform of partnerships has been key to reaching new customers and consistently delivering innovative customer propositions that draw shoppers to our stores, driving increased sales in our core grocery retail business. We have commercialised our capabilities and years of learning derived from our retail experience to partner with various service providers who can deliver access to, among other services, new convenience and delivery channels, where we believe there are significant opportunities to serve our customers in new and appealing ways. For example, since July 2020, we have been partnering with UberEats in 100 of our stores to provide a new delivery option to our customers. Certain partnerships have also allowed us to focus on our omni-channel proposition. For example, we are currently trialling an instore and click & collect concession with the DIY product retailer, B&Q, that expands our reach to customers in the DIY and garden channel. Additionally, we have developed partnerships with general merchandise retailers, that leverage their authority in certain categories and will attract customers to our stores. For example, we have launched a trial with The Entertainer which will see them take over our offering in children's toys. Partnerships across our various channels will continue to be an important focus for us as we continue looking for new ways to reach existing and new customers and to capitalise on our customers' growing desire for convenient lifestyles, whereby individuals seek to accomplish multiple missions at once. See ""Business—Our Tenants and Strategic Partners"" for further detail. In addition to rental income payable from EG Group to ASDA arising from EG Group's proposed roll out of ASDA Food to Go outlets, we also anticipate synergies stemming from incremental uplift to ASDA's wholesale margin from the roll out of the ASDA On the Move wholesale-convenience concept, which is currently being trialled by EG Group at three of their sites. Pro forma Adjusted EBITDA for the 12 months ended September 30, 2020 reflects an adjustment of £7.0 million based on the Shareholders' estimates of the total potential forward-looking run-rate synergies that we expect to realise in the first 24 months from the anticipated uplift to ASDA related to incremental wholesale margin from the roll out of the ASDA On the Move wholesale-convenience concept by EG Group across its network. 167 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2375,MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,2375.4,Key Factors Affecting the Comparability of Our Financial Information,2375.4.1,,"The comparability of the Company's historical financial information is impacted by a number of factors. This section discusses key factors that the Company believes have had a material effect on the comparability of its results of operations and financial condition during the periods under review, as well as those that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on its results of operations and financial condition in the future. _Seasonality of Our Results of Operations_ Our sales and cash flows are affected to a relatively limited extent by seasonal variations due to consumers' shopping habits and, to a lesser extent, weather conditions. Family groups represent a significant proportion of our customer base. As a result, our revenue has historically been comparatively higher during the Christmas and Easter periods. In general, revenue shifts due to weather tend to be relatively short-term, with impacts occurring within a given month, rather than across a quarter or a longer period. From time to time, we may also experience reduced sales revenue if inclement or severe weather reduces in-store footfall and impulse purchases, without concomitant offset by online sales. At the same time, adverse weather conditions, such as snow or flooding, can increase customer demand for our online offerings, although they can also adversely affect our ability to deliver products to customers. In this case, however, increased demand for online offerings would not likely offset reduced sales revenue in stores resulting from inclement weather, as online sales account for a comparatively small portion of our total revenue (excluding petrol) (9.8% in the year ended December 31, 2019 and 13.9% in the 12 months ended September 30, 2020). In general, our fixed costs, including labour expenses (other than related to seasonal workers), real estate leases and SG&A expenses, are more evenly distributed over the year. Additionally, our procurement and sourcing activities are also generally more evenly spread throughout the year, except for a build-up in preparation for the Christmas season. While our financial calendar generally aligns with our operational profile, we experience calendar effects when, for example, the number of trading days or payroll periods in a given period varies from period to period or year to year or certain holidays fall in different periods from year to year. As a result of the foregoing, comparisons of consecutive interim periods may not be a good indication of our performance, and the calendar effects we experience may have an impact on year-on-year comparisons of interim periods. _ASDA Group Pension Scheme Buy-In_ During the year ended December 31, 2019, the trustees of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme entered into an agreement for a bulk annuity insurance buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme with Rothesay Life. This agreement secures the benefits of members and the transaction is expected to de-risk and simplify the Company's balance sheet, is entered into with Rothesay Life, and insures the long-term benefits of approximately 12,300 members of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme. The buy-in transaction, which was enabled by a one-off final contribution by ASDA of £0.7 billion and a loan facility made available by the ASDA Group Pension Scheme's sponsor, ASL (see below), has taken place ahead of a full schemebuy-out that is expected to take place in the first half of 2021. The transaction removes future ASDA Group Pension Scheme liabilities from the ASDA and Walmart balance sheets, simplifying the business. The agreed buy-out will also mean ASDA Group Pension Scheme members will receive an individual annuity policy, issued by Rothesay Life, which will pay members' pension benefits in full. See note 1 (""Accounting _policies"") and note 17 (""Employee benefits"") of the 2019 Financial Statements._ At the time of the buy-in, it was agreed that certain of the assets of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme did not meet the criteria for transfer to Rothesay Life pursuant to the buy-in transaction and were retained by the ASDA Group Pension Scheme (the ""Illiquid Assets""). The sponsor of the scheme, ASL, agreed to make a loan facility available to the trustees in an aggregate principal amount of £467.0 million with the principal purpose of providing liquidity to the ASDA Group Pension Scheme to allow the trustees to pay the premium in full under the buy-in policy with Rothesay Life, and also to provide prudent reserves that are available to fund the operation of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme up to completion of the buy-out and eventual winding-up (the ""Pension Scheme Expenses""). The loan facility was set up on arm's-length terms, including in relation to interest. From completion of the buy-in transaction any proceeds realised in respect of the Illiquid Assets are required to be applied by the trustees to fund interest and principal payments under the loan facility, to the extent such proceeds are not required to be retained to maintain prudent reserves with respect to the Pension Scheme Expenses. Pursuant to arrangements agreed in connection with the Acquisition Agreement, payments received by ASL under the loan facility that are attributable to the Illiquid Assets are required to be paid to Walmart. Accordingly, the risk and reward of the performance of the Illiquid Assets has effectively been transferred to Walmart. To the extent that realisations from the Illiquid Assets are insufficient to cover interest and principal payments owing to ASL 168 ----- under the loan facility, ASL is obliged under a separate agreement to provide sufficient funding to the ASDA Group Pension Scheme to enable the trustees to fund such shortfall. As the amount of such funding provided by ASL to the ASDA Group Pension Scheme would be applied to repay the loan facility owing to ASL, the combined effect of such transactions would have no net impact on ASL. ASL reached an agreement with the trustees of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme to make a cash contribution of £214.6 million to the ASDA Group Pension Scheme on December 30, 2020. Such amount was applied to repay amounts due to ASL under the loan facility on the same day. _IFRS 16 (Leases)_ With respect to the 2019 Financial Statements, the Company applied the new IFRS 16 (Leases) accounting standard, effective from January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective approach, as defined by the IFRS 16 accounting standard. The cumulative effects of applying this new accounting standard were therefore recognised as an adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2019 (the date of initial application), while comparative figures were not restated. Additionally, previous lease-related balances including operating lease prepayments, onerous lease provisions and straight-line rent accruals have been derecognised as part of the Company's adoption of IFRS 16. The 2017 Financial Statements and the 2018 Financial Statements have not been restated for the adoption of IFRS 16 and thus cannot be directly compared to the 2019 Financial Statements, and the Company has not otherwise restated comparative amounts as of and for the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2018. IFRS 16 eliminates the classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases for lessees and introduces a single lessee accounting model with some exemptions for short-term and low-value leases. The lessee recognises a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a lease liability representing its obligation to make lease payments. The effect of applying IFRS 16 is to align the presentation of leases more closely to that of owned assets, rent expense is no longer deducted in arriving at operating profit or EBITDA and instead profit before tax includes an interest charge on the unwinding of the lease liability and a depreciation charge on the right of use asset. _Impact on lessor accounting_ IFRS 16 does not change substantially how a lessor accounts for leases. Under IFRS 16, a lessor continues to classify leases as either finance leases or operating leases and account for those two types of leases differently. Where the Company is an intermediate lessor, the classification under IFRS 16 is required to be made with reference to the right-of-use asset that arises under the head lease. On transition to IFRS 16, there has been no change to how leases where the Company is a head or intermediate lessor are accounted for. _Practical expedients and policy choices_ The Company has applied IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach which: - requires the Company to recognise the cumulative effect of initially applying IFRS 16 as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings at the date of initial application; and - does not permit restatement of comparatives, which continue to be presented under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. IFRS 16 allows for certain transition and accounting policy options for companies taking the modified retrospective approach. The Company has applied the following practical expedients at January 1, 2019, but no others: - to rely on the previous identification of a lease (as provided by IAS 17 or IFRIC 4) for all contracts that existed on January 1, 2019; and - to exclude initial direct costs other than those arising on leases with lease buy-out costs from lease buy-outs (see note 11 (""Intangible Assets"") of the 2019 Financial Statements) from the measurement of the right-of-use asset on January 1, 2019. With respect to all leases previously classified as operating under IAS 17, the Company has elected to measure right-of-use assets recognised on January 1, 2019 at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the balance sheet immediately before January 1, 2019. 169 ----- The Company has taken the following ongoing policy choices from January 1, 2019: - to account for any lease with a term of less than 12 months as a short-term lease, recognising cost in the income on a straight line basis over the lease term and not recognising a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the contract date; - to apply the IFRS 16 low value asset exemption threshold based on the value of the asset when new, on an individual asset basis if deemed appropriate; - to apply a materiality threshold to all leases on and post transition: costs relating to leases with total undiscounted cash flows over the life of the lease below a documented threshold will be expensed as incurred and no right-of-use asset or lease liability will be recognised at the contract date; and - to elect to combine lease and non-lease components prospectively after January 1, 2019: this applies to all leases with the exception of IT and printer leases. For more information, see note 1 (""Accounting Policies"") of the 2019 Financial Statements. _Financial impact of adoption_ In the year ended December 31, 2019, the overall impact of adoption of IFRS 16 on the Company's consolidated income statement was a decrease in profit before tax of £21.3 million, resulting in a decrease in operating costs of £31.4 million and an increase in finance costs of £52.7 million. In addition, right of use assets of £2,263.9 million and additional lease liabilities of £1,979.4 million were recognised on the Company's consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019. _The Transactions_ Historically, the ASDA Group has had little external indebtedness. On October 2, 2020, the Shareholders announced they had reached an agreement with Walmart to acquire the Company pursuant to the Acquisition Agreement. We estimate that, following the Transactions, the Restricted Group will have total third-party debt of approximately £4,721.0 million (of which £750 million relates to the Forecourt Assets Disposal Bridge, which is expected to be repaid in full during the course of 2021). In addition, we estimate that the disposals of the Warehouse Assets by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower or Propco 2, following the CMA Clearance Date and the consummation of the Post-Completion Disposals, may trigger a gain upon disposal and result in a net tax liability for ASDA of approximately £40 million. See ""The Transactions"" and ""Capitalisation."" Accordingly, our financial condition and results of operations following the Transactions will be impacted by interest costs related to this debt and may differ from the historical financial condition and results of operations presented in this discussion as a result of the Transactions.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The modified retrospective approach was taken: prior year comparatives have not been restated. The table above is thus presented on an IFRS 16 basis for 2019 and an IAS 17 basis for 2018 and 2017. Adoption of IFRS 16 in the year ended December 31, 2019 resulted in a decrease to operating costs of £31.4 million and an increase to finance costs of £52.7 million compared with lease-related expenses charged in the prior year under IAS 17. _Results of operations for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine- month period ended September 30, 2019_ Revenue Revenue for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was £16,589.4 million, a decrease of £183.6 million, or 1.1%, compared to £16,773.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to COVID-19-driven impacts. Petrol sales decreased particularly through the periods of lockdown when there was decreased travel by car. Clothing sales also decreased as consumer shopping habits changed in response to COVID-19. These reductions were partially offset by increases in food sales, particularly in edible grocery and fresh food, which were also COVID-19-driven, both due to consumer stock up behaviour ahead of lockdown and due to food spending shifting away from restaurants and takeaways. Operating costs Operating costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were £16,098.3 million, a decrease of £290.5 million, or 1.8%, compared to £16,388.8 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to lower cost of goods sold, driven by decreased petrol and clothing sales, lower business rates as a result of government relief following COVID-19 and lower impairment charges following the impairment of two home shopping centres in the period ended September 30, 2019. There was also a reduction in the expense of share options in the period, primarily driven by lower increases in the Walmart share price. These decreases in operating costs were partially offset by higher cost of goods sold, due to increased food sales and increased employment costs due to COVID-19, including paying colleagues that needed to self-isolate and the payment of an additional thank you payment to colleagues. Food cost of sales was also adversely impacted by the mix of products sold, with an overall shift to lower 173 ----- margin products. There were also increased operating costs as a result of the increase in online sales participation, which incurs more costs for the picking and delivery of orders. Finance income Finance income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was £38.5 million, a decrease of £2.8 million, or 6.8%, compared to £41.3 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The decrease in interest receivable on loans was primarily due to decreased bank interest receivable and was partially offset by increased interest receivable on amounts owed from group undertakings. Finance costs Finance costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 were £49.0 million, a decrease of £18.6 million, or 27.5%, compared to £67.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to reduced net interest cost on the defined benefit pension scheme as a result of the buy in of the ASDA Group pension scheme. Following the buy in there is no longer an additional minimum funding liability and therefore no interest charge on this liability. Income tax expense Income tax expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 amounted to £83.4 million, an increase of £40.3 million, or 93.5%, compared to £43.1 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to increased profit before tax and decreased available tax relief surrendered from elsewhere in the ASDA Group: in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 £24 million less in losses were surrendered to the ASDA Group than in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 amounted to a loss of £8.0 million, a change of £31.6 million, or 79.8%, compared to a loss of £39.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This change was primarily due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars and the settling of those forward contracts that occurred in the relevant period: losses were caused by the GBP strengthening versus the USD over the period of forward contracts, resulting in the contracts being ""out of the money."" The reduced loss in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 is a result of the GBP strengthening less versus the USD over the average forward contract life in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Forward contracts have historically been used by the ASDA Group to hedge purchases against movements in foreign currency: these are mainly forward purchases of USD in GBP that upon settlement are used to pay for imported non-food goods for resale. These are effective hedges, therefore any gain or loss on the forward contracts is accounted for directly in equity and the cost of sale of the goods for resale is recorded at the hedged forward FX rate in the income statement. Cash flow hedges net (loss)/gain during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts Cash flow hedges net gain during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 amounted to a net gain of £18.1 million, a decrease of £16.3 million, or 47.4%, compared to a net gain of £34.4 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars in each financial year and the value of those contracts not settled at the period end based on the exchange rate at the period end. Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was an expense of £1.7 million, a change of £3.2 million, compared to a credit of £1.5 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This change was primarily due to the tax impact of cash flow hedges changing from a net loss in 2019 to a net gain in 2020 as described above. Other comprehensive (expense)/income for the period Other comprehensive expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 amounted to £75.2 million, an increase of £30.5 million, compared to an expense of £44.7 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2019. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net expense items not to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods following the defined pension buy in transaction and was partially offset by items to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result of cash flow hedges, as described above, changing from a net expense to a net credit. 174 ----- _Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018_ Revenue Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was £22,899.2 million, a decrease of £17.3 million, or 0.1%, compared to £22,916.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to decreases in non-edible grocery, fresh food, produce, clothing and general merchandise sales and was partially offset by increases in petrol and edible grocery sales. Operating costs Operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were £22,315.0 million, an increase of £201.7 million, or 0.9%, compared to £22,113.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to higher costs of goods sold as a result of increased petrol sales, increased inventory loss, increased impairment charges, due to the impairment of two home shopping centres in the year ended December 31, 2019, and increased share-based payment charges and was partially offset by lower costs of goods sold due to decreased non-edible grocery, clothing and general merchandise sales as well as the impact of adopting IFRS 16. IFRS 16 results in lower operating costs, as the cost of leases that were previously operating leases and expensed entirely within operating costs are now treated as finance leases, whilst the depreciation component of the charge remains in operating costs, the interest component is now charged to finance costs. Finance income Finance income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was £54.8 million, an increase of £16.9 million, or 44.6%, compared to £37.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased interest receivable on amounts owed from group undertakings and increased bank interest receivables. The increase in interest receivable on loans was primarily due to Wal-Mart Stores (UK) Limited: the loan to this intercompany entity increased over the year due to interest not being repaid, as well as additional loans being made to that entity. There were also increased bank interest receivables due to higher average cash balances in the year. Finance costs Finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2019 were £82.4 million, an increase of £46.2 million compared to £36.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to the impact of adopting IFRS 16 and was partially offset by increased interest income on the plan assets in excess of the interest expense on the defined benefit obligation. Income tax (expense) Income tax for the year ended December 31, 2019 was an expense of £69.6 million, a decrease of £24.9 million, or 26.3%, compared to an expense of £94.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in profit before tax and was partially offset by decreased available tax relief surrendered from elsewhere in the ASDA Group: in the year ended December 31, 2019, £9.0 million less in losses were surrendered to the ASDA Group than in the year ended December 31, 2018. Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to a loss of £38.0 million, a change of £62.2 million compared to a gain of £24.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars and the settling of those forward contracts that occurred in the relevant period: losses were caused by the GBP strengthening versus the USD over the period of forward contracts, resulting in the contracts being ""out of the money."" The loss in the year ended December 31, 2019 is a result of the GBP strengthening versus the USD over the average forward contract life, whereas the gain in the year ended December 31, 2018 is a result of the GBP weakening versus the USD over the average forward contract life. Cash flow hedges net (loss)/gain during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts Cash flow hedges net loss during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to £12.9 million, a change of £51.2 million compared to a net gain of £38.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was primarily due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars in each financial year and the value of those contracts not settled at the end of the year based on the exchange rate at the end of the year. 175 ----- Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2019 was a credit of £9.5 million, a change of £21.4 million compared to an expense of £11.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This change was primarily due to the tax impact of cash flow hedges changing from a net gain in 2018 to a net loss in 2019 as described above. Other comprehensive (expense)/income for the period Other comprehensive expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 amounted to £113.7 million, a change of £193.8 million compared to an income of £80.1 million in the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in items not to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result of the buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme as described above and a decrease in items to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result in cash flow hedges as described above. _Results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2017_ Revenue Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018 was £22,916.5 million, an increase of £696.7 million, or 3.1%, compared to £22,219.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to increases in grocery and petrol sales and was partially offset by decreases in clothing and general merchandise sales. Operating costs Operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were £22,113.3 million, an increase of £628.9 million, or 2.9%, compared to £21,484.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to higher cost of goods sold due to increased grocery and petrol sales and increased employment costs and was partially offset by lower share option expense primarily due to lower increases in the Walmart share price. Finance income Finance income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was £37.9 million, an increase of £25.4 million compared to £12.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase in finance income was primarily due to increased interest receivable on loans to Wal-Mart Stores (UK) Limited: the loan to this intercompany entity increased over the year, due to interest not being repaid as well as additional loans being made to that entity. The increase in finance income was also due to higher average cash balances in the year. Finance costs Finance costs for the year ended December 31, 2018 were £36.2 million, an increase of £0.9 million, or 2.5%, compared to £35.3 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. Income tax (expense) Income tax for the year ended December 31, 2018 was an expense of £94.5 million, an increase of £47.9 million compared to an expense of £46.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to an increase in profit before tax, as well as a decrease in available tax relief surrendered from elsewhere in the ASDA Group. In the year ended December 31, 2018, £28 million less in losses were surrendered to the ASDA Group than in the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement Cash flow hedges reclassification during the period to income statement for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to a gain of £24.2 million, a change of £60.1 million compared to a loss of £35.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This decrease was primarily due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars and the settling of those forward contracts that occurred in each financial year. Cash flow hedges - Net (loss)/gain during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts Cash flow hedges net gain during the period of the not-yet-matured contracts for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to £38.3 million, a change of £72.7 million compared to a net loss of £34.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to fluctuations in the USD/GBP exchange rate between entering into forward contracts to purchase U.S. dollars in each financial year and the value of those contracts not settled at the end of the year based on the exchange rate at the 176 ----- end of the year. Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income Tax on cash flow hedges recognised directly in other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018 was an inflow of £11.9 million, a change of £24.4 million compared to an expense of £12.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This change was primarily due to the tax impact of cash flow hedges changing from a net loss in 2017 to a net gain in 2018, as described above. Other comprehensive (expense)/income for the period Other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2018 amounted to £80.1 million, a change of £145.1 million compared to an expense of £65.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2017. This change was primarily due to an increase in items not to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result of the change in value of the defined benefit pension scheme's assets and liabilities and an increase in items to be reclassified to profit or loss in subsequent periods as a result of cash flow hedges as described above.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

In recent years, the Company's cash-generative business, due to the nature of the grocery industry, together with the Company's relatively low capital expenditure, has driven cash flow generation, including comparatively high unlevered free cash flow. Our principal source of liquidity on an ongoing basis is expected to be our operating cash flows and borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities. Our ability to generate cash depends on our future operating performance, which, in turn, depends to some extent on general economic, financial, industry and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. See ""Risk Factors."" Although we believe that our expected cash flows from operations, together with available borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facilities, will be adequate to meet our anticipated working capital and general corporate needs for the next 12 months, we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities or that future debt financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, including the Notes offered hereby, or to fund our other liquidity needs.

The modified retrospective approach was taken: prior year comparatives have not been restated. The table above is thus presented on an IFRS 16 basis for 2019 and an IAS 17 basis for 2018 and 2017. Cash flows (used in)/ from operating activities Cash flows from operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased by £502.0 million, from an inflow of £199.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to an inflow of £701.5 million for nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to increased operating profit, a lower decrease in trade and other payables for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019, a lower increase in inventories for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019 and to the Company having paid no further defined benefit pension contributions in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 following the buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme in 2019. This increase was partially offset by a lower add back of non-cash charges due to lower impairment expense as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2019. The change in payables was due to timing, with the year ended December 31, 2019 particularly impacted by December 31, 2018 having a high payables balance, as this fell just before a weekly supplier payment run. Additionally, movement in payroll accruals had an impact, with lower year-to-date reduction in accruals than in the prior year and increased gift card payables, as a result of increased gift card use. The change in inventory is mainly due to September 2019 being a higher than usual inventory value, due in part to issues with excess clothing inventory that were subsequently resolved. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 changed by £1,329.8 million, from an inflow of £1,291.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of £38.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This change was primarily due to the cash outflow associated with the buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme of £827.1 million (see note 17 (""Employee benefits"") of the Company's 2019 Financial Statements for further details), a decrease in trade and other payables of £385.0 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, as compared to an increase in trade and other payables of £242.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2018, as a result of having 53 weekly supplier payment runs in 2019, a higher benefit from negotiating improved payment terms with suppliers in 2018 than 2019 and, due to trading performance, a reduction in purchases contributing to lower trade and other payables in 2019, compared to a growth in purchases in 2018 and a reduction in operating profit of £219.0 million relating to decreases in non-edible grocery, fresh food, produce, clothing and general merchandise sales that were partially offset by increases in petrol and edible grocery sales. This was further partially offset by a change in cash flow classification arising from the implementation of IFRS 16 on January 1, 2019, which results in a higher value of cash outflows associated with lease payments being recognised within net cash flow from financing activities, rather than net cash flows from operating activities. Cash flows from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 increased by £1.8 million, from an inflow of £1,289.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an inflow of £1,291.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This increase was primarily due to increased operating profit for the year and a lower year on year increase in inventory, partially offset by an increase in trade receivables for the year ended December 31, 2018 as compared to a decrease in the year ended December 31, 2017 178 ----- and a lower increase in the share-based payment liability for the year ended December 31, 2018 than the increase recorded in the year ended December 31, 2017. Cash flows used in investing activities Cash flows used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 decreased by £148.7 million, or 78.1%, from an outflow of £190.3 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to an outflow of £41.6 million for nine months ended September 30, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the cash inflow from the partial repayment of the loan made to the pension scheme as part of the pension buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme as described above. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by £288.5 million, or 88.6%, from an outflow of £325.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of £614.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to the buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme as described above (for which there was no impact in the year ended December 31, 2018), which accounted for £308 million of this change and which was partially offset by reduced capital expenditure. Cash flows used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by £48.9 million, or 13.1%, from an outflow of £374.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an outflow of £325.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to lower capital expenditures, as well as higher interest received on cash held and intercompany receivables between the Group and Walmart. Cash flows used in financing activities Cash flows used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 increased by £1,178.3 million, from an outflow of £213.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2019 to an outflow of £1,391.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020. This increase was primarily due to a dividend of £1.15 billion paid in the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and no dividends having been paid during the nine months ended September 30, 2019. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2019 increased by £112.9 million, or 51.1%, from an outflow of £221.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to an outflow of £333.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to reclassification of cash flows following the implementation of IFRS 16, and was partially offset by a lower increase in intercompany receivables between the Group and Walmart for the year ended December 31, 2019 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018, due to the Group providing lower loan amounts to other Walmart companies in the year ended December 31, 2019 than in the year ended December 31, 2018. Lease-related cash outflows classified as financing activities were £182.5 million (as compared to £11.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018). Although the classification of lease-related cash outflows was impacted by the implementation in the year of IFRS 16, as noted above, there was no significant impact from IFRS 16 on total cash flows. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2018 decreased by £384.7 million, or 63.5%, from an outflow of £605.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 to an outflow of £221.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This decrease was primarily due to an increase in intercompany payables between the Group and Walmart for the year ended December 31, 2018, as compared to a decrease in intercompany payables between the Group and Walmart for the year ended December 31, 2017. _Revolving Credit Facilities_ As part of the Transactions, the Group entered into the Senior Facilities Agreement which provides for the Senior Facilities, including the Revolving Credit Facilities. The Group expects to draw under the Revolving Credit Facilities upon the completion of the Offering. The Senior Facilities Agreement provides for multi-currency senior secured revolving credit facilities in an aggregate amount equal to £690.0 million. The Revolving Credit Facilities may be utilised by any Original Revolving Facility Borrower or Additional Revolving Facility Borrower (subject to certain exceptions) under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, a Lender may also provide Letters of Credit, Fronted Ancillary Facilities or Ancillary Facilities (in each case as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) on a bilateral basis in place of all or part of its Revolving Facility Commitment. Pursuant to the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement, loans made under the Revolving Credit Facilities may be borrowed, repaid and re-borrowed at any time. Such loans will be available to be used 179 ----- for, amongst other purposes, general corporate and working capital purposes of the Group (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) and, without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing, to fund certain permitted acquisitions, capital expenditure, certain fees and other amounts payable in connection with the Transaction (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) and to backstop existing ancillary facilities, letters of credit and/or hedging arrangements of the Target Group (if applicable) and financing or refinancing any other transactions contemplated in connection with the Acquisition (each as defined under the Senior Facilities Agreement). The Group will be subject to certain customary affirmative, negative and incurrence covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement, which impose restrictions on, among other things, incurrence of other debt, making restricted payments, disposal of assets and granting of security, subject to certain agreed exceptions and permissions, qualifications and thresholds. See ""Description of Certain Financing _Arrangements."" Capital Expenditure_ The Company typically has relatively low capital expenditure requirements. Capital expenditure has on average amounted to 1.5% of sales (excluding petrol) between the year ended December 31, 2017 and the nine months ended September 30, 2020, and has mainly been invested in store remodelling and real estate.

The primary reason for the difference in these two items is due to the timing of when the assets are paid for. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018 capital expenditure focused principally on replacing essential assets and refreshing our store estate. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2018 we also opened one grocery home shopping fulfilment centre. During the year ended December 31, 2019, work started on a third George.com fulfilment centre in the North East of England, with other capital expenditure continuing to focus on replacing essential physical and digital assets and implementation of the store refresh programme. During the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, capital expenditure activity was impacted significantly by COVID-19-driven programme delays, but recovered quickly in the third quarter of the 2020 financial year, with a continued focus on our store refresh and asset replacement programmes, and on the acceleration of strategic change programmes to transform our front end and counters propositions, as well as increasing online fulfilment capacity. Our capital expenditure requirements vary from year to year based on, among other factors, specific reinvestment requirements in relation to our sites and specific initiatives to develop our technologies, and as such, we cannot assure you that our level of capital expenditure will not increase significantly in the future. 180 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The Company has a risk management programme in place through which it seeks to mitigate the adverse effects of these market risks. Following consummation of the Transactions, we may hedge interest and exchange rate exposure. We do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. _Credit risk_ We believe there is no significant credit risk within the Company. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is included in their carrying value as at the balance sheet date. See note 13 (""Trade and other receivables"") of the Company's 2019 Financial Statements for further information on trade receivables and details of recoverability. The Company has established procedures to minimise the risk of default in relation to trade receivables including detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted. Historically, these procedures have proven effective in minimising the level of impaired and past due receivables. Surplus cash is placed on short-term deposit with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Company's treasury function, which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit. Deposit limits and approved financial institutions have historically been dictated by the investment policy of the ultimate parent company. Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses 181 ----- model under IFRS 9 (Financial Instruments) and no impairment is required. _Interest rate risk_ The Company's short-term borrowings have historically all been held with entities which are part of the Walmart Inc. group and have been at fixed rates of interest. Amounts owed to fellow subsidiaries (see note 24 (""Related Parties"") of the Company's 2019 Financial Statements) accrue interest at a rate of 5.448% to 6% in the year ended December 31, 2019 (which was also the case during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018). As interest rates have been fixed on all of the Company's historical debt, interest rate movements would not have an impact on profitability, cash flow or equity in prior periods. Following the Transactions and subject to the assumptions set forth under ""Use of Proceeds,"" our indebtedness and other debt arrangements will be primarily composed of the Senior Facilities, including the Revolving Credit Facilities, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility and the Notes (all of which, other than the Notes, will bear a floating interest rate based on EURIBOR or LIBOR, as applicable). _Liquidity risk_ The Company's Treasury function ensures that the Company continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring rolling forecasts of the Company's cash flows. The Company's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At December 31, 2019, the Company had no external borrowings, other than lease liabilities. At December 31, 2019, the Company held cash of £1,929.3 million (as compared to £2,916.1 million at December 31, 2018 and £2,171.7 million at December 31, 2017), utilised along with overdrafts where necessary, to secure short-term flexibility. At December 31, 2019, the Company had committed overdraft facilities of £30.0 million (as compared to £30.0 million at December 31, 2018 and £30.0 million of uncommitted overdraft facilities at December 31, 2017), standby credit facilities, including bonds of £96.7 million (as compared to £112.1 million at December 31, 2018 and £112.9 million at December 31, 2017), and committed lines of credit facilities of £30.0 million (as compared to £125.0 million at December 31, 2018 and uncommitted lines of credit facilities £125.0 million at December 31, 2017). The Company also has historically had access to an intercompany financing facility which gives ASDA the ability to borrow from other Walmart entities and which is available to other subsidiaries of Walmart, the limit of which depends on the usage by fellow subsidiaries. This intercompany financing facility will be terminated upon the completion of the Acquisition. _Foreign currency risk_ The Company purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than pounds sterling. Cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US dollars and euro. Some purchases in US dollars are managed through the use of forward contracts. The Company implements hedge accounting and had forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at December 31, 2019, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases. The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a period of more than 12 months after December 31, 2019. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at December 31, 2019, a net unrealised loss of £11.8 million (as compared to a net unrealised gain of £29.6 million as at December 31, 2018 and a net unrealised loss of £21.0 million as at December 31, 2017) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of hedging contracts. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of these hedging contracts was £41.4 million (as compared to a net gain of £50.6 million as at December 31, 2018 and a net loss of £57.8 million as at December 31, 2017). This consists of £38.0 million of gains reclassified to the income statement during the year (as compared to £24.2 million of losses as at December 31, 2018 and £35.9 million of gains as at December 31, 2017), a £12.9 million loss on not-yet-matured contracts during the year (as compared to a £38.3 million gain as at December 31, 2018 and a £34.4 million loss as at December 31, 2017) and a £9.5 million taxation credit (as compared to a £11.9 million charge as at December 31, 2018 and £12.5 million credit as at December 31, 2017). 182 ----- Under the Company's hedging policy, the only items for which forward currency contracts are in place are forecast purchases of goods for resale. The Company hedges up to 95% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the income statement upon maturity of the forward contract. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash flows would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this occurred during the year ended December 31, 2019 (which was also the case during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2018), therefore amounts recognised in the income statement in relation to ineffective hedges were nil (which was also the case during the year ended December 31, 2018). The Facility B will be denominated in euro and the Senior Secured Notes, Senior Notes, Facility A and the Forecourt Assets Disposal Bridge Facility will be denominated in pounds sterling, and changes in foreign exchange rates will therefore give rise to foreign exchange exposure with respect to the Facility B. As the Company manages more than half of its foreign currency exposure through the use of forward currency contracts, changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on shortterm profitability or cash flow. It is anticipated that a 5% movement in the US dollar/pounds sterling exchange rate, which represents management's assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of £29.7 million (as compared to a movement of £36.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2018 and £42.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017). _Capital risk_ The Company is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of its business. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Company has historically had the option to adjust the amount of intercompany loans payable or receivable to and from the Walmart Inc. group of companies. There were no changes to the Company's approach to capital management during the year ended December 31, 2019. Full details of the Company's approach to capital management and how the Company defines capital is provided in the Strategic Report that is included in the 2019 Financial Statements.

According to Euromonitor, grocery retail – referring to the sum of hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, and food and drink e-commerce – is the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom and in 2019 it represented £163.1 billion of Retail Value RSP (comprising approximately 42% of total retail sales). In the past twelve years, grocery retail in the United Kingdom has not experienced negative year-on-year (""YoY"") growth, despite macroeconomic uncertainties and periods of food deflation measured by the consumer price index (""CPI""), according to the OECD. We operate in the retail market, offering a wide range of both food and non-food products and services from our supercentres, superstores, supermarkets and ASDA Living stores, as well as through various online platforms. The origins of our business are in the UK grocery retail market and, while our business has grown and diversified into other markets including clothing retail and general merchandise retail, we remain focused on offering high-quality, value-based grocery retail options to our customers. Within the UK grocery retail market, we hold the third-largest market share, representing 12.2% of total expenditure by households in the United Kingdom on specific grocery sectors (fresh & chilled, ambient, frozen, alcohol, household, toiletries and healthcare) (""Total Grocery Absolute Sales""), calculated on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar. 184 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

(Source: Euromonitor: Retailing 2020 Edition. Note: The UK grocery retail market refers to the sum of channels, including hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail as well as food and drink e-commerce.) In 2019, grocery retail was the single largest category of retail spending in the United Kingdom and was valued at £163.1 billion on a Retail Value RSP basis, according to Euromonitor. Between 2007 and 2014, the UK grocery retail market grew at a CAGR of 4.3%. Between 2014 and 2019, the market experienced limited growth, in part due to stagnant or marginally declining selling prices, which led to a CAGR of 1.6% over that period. Generally, however, we believe that sales in the UK grocery retail market have demonstrated resilience and stability through economic cycles. The UK grocery retail market is expected to continue to grow in spite of the macroeconomic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, both of which are likely to drive recessionary shopping patterns. According to the ONS, the United Kingdom's real gross domestic product (""GDP"") amounted to £2.3 trillion in 2019. The following chart sets forth the historical and projected YoY real GDP growth in the United Kingdom for the period from 2007 to 2023. According to Fitch Solutions, although the United Kingdom's GDP is projected to have declined by 9.0% in 2020 due primarily to COVID-19, GDP is expected to rebound in 2021 and return to pre-COVID-19 levels and stabilise by 2023, with an average expected GDP growth of approximately 1.7% from 2023 to 2025. (Sources: Fitch Solutions.) 185 ----- According to the ONS, as set forth in the following chart the United Kingdom's population reached 66.8 million in 2019 and is expected to grow at an approximate CAGR of 0.4% between 2019 and 2031. (Source: ONS.) In 2019, UK households spent, on average, £61.90 per week on food and non-alcoholic drinks, comprising 10.6% of average weekly household expenditure according to the ONS. Between 2007 and 2019, the percentage of average household expenditure spent on food and non-alcoholic drinks ranged from 11.3% to 10.4%, as shown in the following chart. (Source: ONS.) Furthermore, the split between at-home and out-of-home (""OOH"") food and drink consumption in the United Kingdom has remained relatively stable in recent years. While the percentage of at-home food and drink consumption as compared to OOH food and drink consumption increased by approximately 200 basis points from 2007 to 2012 as a consequence of the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the split remained relatively stable from 2007 to 2019, as illustrated in the following chart. (Sources: ONS, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (""DEFRA"").) 186 ----- Moreover, as shown in the following chart, the UK grocery retail market has continued to show positive YoY market growth for the past twelve years. This growth too is reflective of the relatively essential nature of grocery purchases, which represent a necessary and regular household expenditure as compared to more discretionary spending categories, such as clothing, footwear and electronics. (Source: Euromonitor: Retailing 2020 Edition. Note: The UK grocery retail market refers to the sum of channels including hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, and food and drink e-commerce.) While the overall UK grocery retail market has in recent years remained stable in many respects, market channels and customer habits have been changing. Customer preference has shifted away from larger, out-of-town formats towards smaller, proximity formats, with customers prioritising convenience and shopping habits shifting towards smaller basket sizes coupled with increased frequency of purchases. The industry has also seen the rapid growth of discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and Lidl) that compete through differentiation on price coupled with a more limited selection of own-brand products. In addition to these changes within the physical store channels, the UK grocery retail market has also seen an increasing shift away from physical stores towards online purchasing. More recently, according to Kantar, COVID-19 has accelerated the shifts towards these online and convenience formats since lockdown measures were first introduced in the United Kingdom earlier this year, as shown in the chart below. Underlying all of these trends is a shift towards at-home food and drink consumption away from OOH food and drink consumption, which has led to an 12.3% YoY increase in the value of the overall UK grocery retail market on a Total Grocery Absolute Sales basis for the 52 weeks ended December 27, 2020.

(Source: Euromonitor Retailing 2020 Edition. Note: The UK grocery retail market refers to the sum of channels including hypermarkets and supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retail, and food and drink e-commerce.) Grocery retail sales in the United Kingdom are made via multiple channels, including hypermarkets, supermarkets, convenience stores, discounters, forecourt retailers and online. We currently operate in the hypermarket, supermarket and online channels. Hypermarkets are larger-format retail stores, frequently located on out-of-town sites or as anchor stores in a shopping centres, with a primary focus on selling food, beverages, tobacco and other groceries while offering a wide variety of non-grocery products, such as general merchandise and clothing. Supermarkets are smaller-scale retail stores that offer a wide variety of food, beverages and household products. Hypermarket formats are offered by the traditional grocers, while supermarket stores are offered by the Co-op, Waitrose and M&S, in addition to the traditional grocers. Based on Euromonitor data, the sum of hypermarket and supermarket channels constitute the largest share by Retail Value RSP of the UK grocery retail market, representing 61.1% of grocery Retail Value RSP in 2019. However, in the last five calendar years, growth for the sum of these two channels has declined, with a combined CAGR of -0.4% between 2014 and 2019, according to Euromonitor. In contrast, over the past fifteen years convenience stores such as Tesco Express, Sainsbury's Local, Co-op On the Go, Little Waitrose and M&S Simply Food, have gained popularity. In 2019, they represented 19.0% of Retail Value RSP and are the second-largest channel in the grocery retail market, according to Euromonitor. The 2007-2009 global financial crisis and the resulting weakened customer sentiment thereafter helped discounters (mainly represented by Aldi and Lidl) to gain a strong foothold in the UK grocery retail market. Between 2007 and 2014, discounters gained considerable scale and market share due to new store openings and increased footfall resulting primarily from product offerings targeted at increasingly priceconscious customers.

The online channel, which has also reported strong Retail Value RSP 188 ----- growth historically, with a 11.0% CAGR between 2007 and 2019, is driven by shoppers' growing appetite for convenience and digital connectivity, as well as by service enhancements in online operations.

According to Euromonitor, the UK clothing and footwear retail market was valued at £42.3 billion on a Retail Value RSP basis in 2019. During the 2007-2009 global financial crisis, the UK clothing and footwear retail market declined as a result of rising unemployment, pressure on discretionary spending and weakened customer confidence. Furthermore, the market experienced a period of price inflation between 2010 and 2012. Over the past five years, the UK clothing and footwear retail market has grown at a CAGR of 2.8%, with much of the growth driven by online channels, which had a CAGR of 12.1% between 2014 and 2019 in comparison to a CAGR of only 0.1% for in-store channels, each on a Retail Value RSP basis, as stated by Euromonitor. These results reflect an overall trend toward increased access to, and usage of, the internet coupled with a greater propensity to buy online and growing usage of social media to influence and facilitate clothing and footwear retail sales. The UK clothing and footwear retail market experienced a significant downturn in the first half of 2020 due to COVID-19 related lockdowns and reduced consumer demand for non-essential purchases which included clothing and footwear.

Such customers, however, still desire high-quality offerings. In response, discounters developed a range of valuebased propositions focused on delivering high quality at low prices, which appeal to this growing number of UK shoppers who seek a good 'value'. These propositions have helped discounters to achieve a strong presence in the UK grocery retail market. For example, discounters Aldi and Lidl have increased their combined market share (on a Total Grocery Absolute Sales basis) from 3.7% in the calendar year 2007 to 12.1% in the calendar year 2019, according to Kantar and as reflected in the following chart. (Source: Kantar.) From 2013 to 2019, discounters gained considerable scale and market share as a result of new store openings and continued price consciousness from customers.

Pure online players, such as Ocado and Amazon Fresh, also compete in the UK online grocery market. The strong growth of online grocery sales in the United Kingdom is supported by multiple drivers, including: - Increasing population of tech-aware customers with a higher propensity to buy online; - Higher internet penetration (driven by increased usage of mobile and faster connections) combined with an increasing propensity to use the internet to buy online; - Technological advances significantly improving the online proposition for customers (such as better interfaces, mobile apps, convenient digital wallets and payment systems); 194 ----- - Improving product offerings as technology improves and competition increases (for example, greater availability of products online compared to in-store); and - Improving delivery options as density of deliveries improves (resulting in cheaper, faster deliveries and improved availability of more predictable, flexible and diverse delivery timeslots). Growth in online grocery has been accelerated by the onset of COVID-19 as customers have increasingly prioritised factors such as social distancing and convenience and government restrictions have encouraged customers to find ways to remain at home.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.6,UK Grocery Retail Key Trends,18.6.3,Shift to Convenience,"Another significant customer trend shaping the UK grocery retail market is customers' increasing prioritisation of convenience. As part of that, there is an increasing preference amongst customers for more frequent but smaller shopping trips, with numerous top-ups through the course of the week at smaller, more conveniently located stores. This trend can be partly explained by a preference for reduced food waste in light of growing environmental concerns, smaller households, less pre-planned lifestyles and a growing preference in general for convenience. This trend has also been compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic as shoppers increasingly seek conveniently located stores in order to avoid longer travel for health and safety reasons and comply with government restrictions put in place since the outbreak of the pandemic.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Customers are now seeking a transparent and frictionless experience to improve and expedite their grocery retail experience. This is reflected in the increased usage of self-checkout, ""Scan & Go,"" ""Click & Collect"" and online services as customers opt to use these facilities to tailor and improve their shopping experiences. In line with the growing desire for convenience and efficient shopping experiences, there is increasing demand for combined and differentiated service offerings in the grocery retail market, which allow customers to fulfil multiple needs in one convenient location such as parcel collection and drop-off, pharmacy services and selections of household items, all in addition to traditional grocery retail offerings.

There is a growing share of customers who have concerns about animal welfare, environmental sustainability and ethical sourcing, and who view their purchasing decision as a lifestyle statement. In line with these concerns, customers are increasingly demanding traceability and information about production methods, driving the popularity of fair trade and organic products that can meet these needs.

We operate a significant store estate of 614 stores (excluding standalone PFSs) that are geographically diversified across the United Kingdom. We also have the second-largest online grocery platform in the United Kingdom (in terms of Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020, according to Kantar).

Based on Total Grocery Absolute Sales on a 52-week basis as of December 27, 2020. *Ocado Market share shown.) We operate in the large and historically stable UK grocery retail market that is underpinned by favourable macroeconomic factors including GDP, population, consumer confidence and household expenditure on food and beverages and which has historically demonstrated resilient performance through economic fluctuations. Groceries are a necessary and regular consumer expenditure, which we believe generally allows the grocery retail market to weather economic downturns better than certain other retail markets. For example, the UK grocery retail market demonstrated its two strongest periods of growth in recent history during the 2007-2009 global financial crisis and during the COVID-19 pandemic. See also ""Industry."" One of the key capabilities that drives our performance is our differentiated operating model, which is in turn centred around our omni-channel offer (with multiple fulfilment options), our commitment to ""Every Day Low Price"" and our wholly-owned supplier, IPL, which enables us to take a vertically-integrated approach to procurement and which we believe gives us a competitive advantage in food sourcing. Other key capabilities that drive our performance include our profitable and well-established George Clothing and George Home offers, our well-developed own-brand grocery offers and our team of flexible and engaged colleagues. Historically, we have benefited from the support of Walmart, our former parent company. We will continue to receive support from Walmart over the next three years pursuant to the Transitional Agreements negotiated in connection with the Acquisition. For more information about the ongoing support to be provided by Walmart, please see ""Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions— _Transitional Agreements with Walmart"" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Transactions—There are risks associated with the Separation of ASDA from Walmart.""_ We are a highly cash-generative business of scale with strong asset backing. In the year ended December 31, 2019, our revenue was approximately £22.9 billion (including petrol), of which approximately £2 billion was online sales, and our Adjusted EBITDA was approximately £1.2 billion (including petrol). 196 ----- The chart below presents the breakdown of our 2019 revenue by product category (food, general merchandise, clothing and petrol), food category (ambient and fresh and produce) and channel (stores and online (including George.com)). (Source: ASDA information. Year ended December 31, 2019. Note: Does not include £61 million of other revenue.) Our differentiated operating model has resulted in strong financial performance: our successful financial profile is underpinned by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins, free cash flow (defined as Adjusted EBITDA less capital expenditure) and cash conversion (defined as Free Cash Flow divided by Adjusted EBITDA) in recent years. In 2018 and 2019, our average Adjusted EBITDA margin was 5.5% (including petrol), our cumulative free cash flow was approximately £1.7 billion and our average cash conversion was approximately 70%.

We believe that our omni-channel food offer delivers low prices across the full basket and that we maintain a meaningful price gap as compared to other traditional grocers in the United Kingdom.

We believe that we are the least expensive full-selection traditional grocer in the United Kingdom: according to internal ASDA data, our prices are approximately 6% to 7.5% less expensive than our traditional grocer competitors (on a 2020 year-to-date (weeks 1-42) average, based on total goods price gap percentage). Our food business is already of significant scale, is supported by a strong online offer and is supplemented by a large clothing and general merchandise business.

We operate 30 supercentres (approximately 5% of our total stores), 82% of which are freehold or long leasehold and which accounted for 11% of our store-based revenue (which is all revenue that is derived from stores (including grocery home shopping orders fulfilled from stores, as opposed to the home shopping centres), and excluding George.com, income from the distribution network and grocery home shopping orders fulfilled from home shopping centres) in 2019. Supercentres generally have net square footage of 65,000 to 101,000 square feet and an average sales area of approximately 83,000 square feet. Superstores are large-format stores featuring a food-led offer, as well as a non-food offer, including general merchandise, clothing, concessions and in-store dining and refreshment facilities, with petrol being offered at most of our superstores. We operate 396 superstores (approximately 65% of our total stores), 73% of which are freehold or long leasehold and which accounted for 82% of our storebased revenue in 2019. Superstores generally have net square footage of 15,000 to 75,000 square feet and an average sales area of approximately 42,000 square feet. - _Supermarkets: supermarkets are small-format stores focused on food, with a limited general merchandise and George Clothing offer. We operate 155 supermarkets (approximately 25% of our total stores), 83% of our supermarkets are freehold or long leasehold and our supermarkets accounted for 5% of our store-based revenue in 2019. Supermarkets generally have net square footage of 5,000 to 15,000 square feet and an average sales area of approximately 9,000 square feet. 214 ----- - _ASDA Living: ASDA Living stores are dedicated non-food stores that include general merchandise, George Clothing and George home offers. We operate 33 ASDA Living stores (approximately 5% of our total stores), none of which are freehold or long leasehold and which accounted for 1% of our store-based revenue in 2019. ASDA Living stores generally have net square footage of 15,000 to 39,000 square feet and an average sales area of approximately 27,000 square feet. - _Petrol filling stations (PFSs): PFSs include the current network of standalone petrol filling stations, including 42 small convenience stores with a limited range of food and non-food offers. We have historically operated 305 co-located PFSs and 18 standalone PFSs, 81% and 94% of which are freehold or long leasehold, respectively. PFSs generally have net square footage of 500 to 2,500 square feet. These standalone PFSs and co-located PFSs will be sold to EG Group pursuant to the Forecourt Business Disposal or, to the extent we are required to do so to obtain regulatory approval for the Acquisition, we will sell all or part of our forecourt business to third parties.

Our supplier audit framework measures compliance, supplier performance against food safety hazard analysis and critical control point principles. In addition, we have a quality management system that measures how our products perform in terms of quality. To control the quality of the products we sell, we execute a number of quality control initiatives. We conduct regular quality controls on the acceptance of fresh food at our depots. In addition, we analyse ownbrand product samples in our in-house sensory kitchens and through a third-party, Cambridge Market Research, to ensure that our products meet our customers' expectations. We conduct quarterly food safety audits at our stores to ensure that each store meets our required standards for food safety and hygiene. We conduct annual refresher trainings for store colleagues to ensure that they are trained in all relevant aspects of food safety, including allergen management. All new own-brand suppliers must be Global Food Safety Initiative accredited and must pass a new supplier audit before proceeding. In addition, all own-brand suppliers will have an annual unannounced ASDA bolt-on food safety audit that measures supplier adherence to ASDA policy. 217 ----- When deciding whether to work with an own-brand supplier, we monitor the quality of its products based on a control of samples delivered by the supplier during the selection phase. Following selection, we regularly evaluate the quality of the products the supplier offers, including through randomly selected samples. Our general supplier terms and conditions include a section dedicated to quality, safety, labelling and traceability. By signing these terms and conditions, our suppliers confirm that they are fully aware of, and comply with, our safety and quality standards.

We carry out a range of monitoring activities to provide assurance of the effectiveness of our policies and procedures. These activities are completed by both internal teams and external experts. We have a wide variety of health and safety and ethics policies that address topics such as Food Safety, Food Contamination, Warehouse Safety, Product Safety, Privacy, Environment and Environmental Services, Anti-Money Laundering and Licences and Permits, among others.

With respect to our environmental goals, we strive to reduce carbon emissions, promote sustainable farming and fishing practices, sustainably source ingredients like palm oil that make their way into our products, reduce food, product and packaging waste throughout our supply chain and deliver a greener proposition to customers at a great value. We have a demonstrated track record of giving back to local communities through our ASDA Foundation, among other dedicated community initiatives, while also striving to tackle wider social issues through fundraising efforts with long-standing partners such as Breast Cancer Now and BBC Children in Need.

1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,2382,OUR SUPPLIERS AND LOGISTICS,2382.4,,2382.4.1,,"We operate a ""hub and spoke"" logistics network, with two hubs and two deconsolidation centres serving 33 depots throughout the United Kingdom. Our logistics model is designed to support our extensive store and online businesses. This approach starts with suppliers that provide goods to our hubs and depots as well as directly to our stores for certain products. Our hubs and depots supply our stores via our fleet. In addition to in-store purchasing, ASDA and ASDA Logistics Services also offer customers home delivery and Click & Collect services. _Hubs: Our two hubs are split by category: our Lutterworth hub handles general merchandise and_ ambient goods, while our Doncaster hub, which is operated by a third party, handles general merchandise and ambient products. _Suppliers: We had more than 4,400 active suppliers as of September 30, 2020, the top 20 of which_ (excluding IPL and petrol) reflected approximately 35% of cost of goods sold (excluding VAT, for the October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 period). These suppliers deliver goods either to a hub (such as for ambient and non-edible products and non-food products), direct to depots (such as for fresh food, produce and fast-moving ambient) or direct to stores (such as for bread). New suppliers undergo a number of checks and procedures managed via the shared service centre team. If a supplier is identified as a third-party intermediary, which is typically only relevant to goods not for resale suppliers presenting a bribery and corruption risk, further procedures are required as part of the on-boarding and ongoing management processes for that supplier, focused on anti-corruption. During the on-boarding of goods not for resale suppliers, we undertake a compliance risk review covering topics including, among others, modern slavery, information security and privacy. If compliance risks are identified, then we agree on and implement 215 ----- appropriate mitigation measures. Relationships with goods for resale suppliers are managed by the relevant buying team within the commercial team. Our buyers are responsible for negotiating key terms, including pricing, promotional activity, supplier income arrangements, and payment terms. For goods not for resale suppliers, the applicable business owners manage the contract terms and arrangements. We leverage supplier relationships to deliver supply chain continuity. _Ordering process: the purchase order process varies according to the category of goods._ ## •Goods for resale: Automatic orders are generated with suppliers based on stock levels / stock availability, historical demand trends and forecast trends. This is applicable for the majority of food orders. The supply team has manual override capabilities for automatic orders, albeit limited and rarely required. Non-food products typically operate on a longer lead time. The orders are based on forecast sales numbers provided to the supply team by the buying team and the commercial finance team. ## •Goods not for resale: Purchase orders are raised by the procurement team or the applicable colleague and reviewed by the budget holder (the individual who is responsible for the budget to which the associated cost relates) within that colleague's team. Logistics facilities: logistics facilities_ receive, process, warehouse and distribute goods for sale at our stores. IPL, Forza and Kober are treated as suppliers and largely deliver to depots. In addition, we operate home shopping centres, which are fulfilment centres for online grocery orders. _Fleet: ASDA drivers deliver goods to stores and customers using fleet vehicles (approximately 1,150_ leased tractors and approximately 2,300 leased trailers), home shopping vans (approximately 2,800 leased vans) or occasional spot-hire or use of third-party hauliers (figures as of January 6, 2021). _Stores: aside from in store purchasing, we also offer our customers home delivery and Click & Collect_ service. **IPL** We believe we have a competitive advantage in food sourcing via IPL and its two subsidiary companies, Forza and Kober, which enables a vertically integrated approach to procurement. IPL is an important asset that provides valuable sourcing differentiation. In 2019, £1.5 billion was purchased through IPL, reducing our overall costs. Our 2019 product mix sourced from IPL was 60% produce, 28% protein, 8% beverages and 3% grocery. IPL employed over 4,000 colleagues as of December 31, 2019 across its group of companies, and only serves us. IPL receives products directly from producers and centralises sourcing, processing and packaging. This disintermediation of export agents, import agencies, suppliers and packers is the foundation of IPL's cost price advantage: IPL sources produce, cooked meats, wine, nuts and dried fruit, plants and flowers and has a national footprint of nine processing facilities across the United Kingdom, supported by seven overseas technical/logistical operations. IPL's overseas offices provide us with the benefit of being close to our foreign suppliers and sources, which we believe gives us greater insight and control over our supply chain, conferring on us a competitive advantage as compared to competitors that do not benefit from comparable vertically integrated procurement. 216 ----- The map below shows IPL's UK footprint. (Source: ASDA information.) IPL operates with five business units: produce (sourcing approximately whole and prepared fruit, whole vegetables, potatoes and onions, plants and flowers), protein (sourcing cooked meat and bacon), beverages (sourcing wine), grocery (sourcing snack nuts, desserts and baking, cereal and other nuts and dried fruit) and central functions (employing colleagues across IT, finance, legal and compliance and HR functions). The key countries of origin from which we source products via IPL are: the United Kingdom, Spain, the Netherlands, Denmark and other European Union countries, South Africa, Thailand, Brazil, Vietnam and Bolivia.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The claimants allege that the work performed by colleagues in ASDA's retail stores is of equal value in terms of, among other things, the demands of their jobs compared to that of colleagues working in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities, that the difference in pay between these job positions disparately impacts women because more women work in retail stores while more men work in warehouses and distribution facilities, and that the pay difference is not objectively justified. The claimants are requesting differential back pay based on higher wage rates in the warehouse and distribution facilities and higher wage rates on a prospective basis. In October 2016, following a preliminary hearing, the Employment Tribunal ruled that claimants could compare their positions in ASDA's retail stores with those of colleagues in ASDA's warehouse and distribution facilities. ASDA appealed the ruling and the oral argument was held before the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom in July 2020. We are awaiting a decision. Notwithstanding the appeal, claimants are proceeding in the next phase of their claims.

We believe we have substantial factual and legal defences to these claims, and intend to defend the claims vigorously. Under a separate indemnity undertaking, the Seller has agreed to indemnify the Purchaser in respect of certain costs and losses incurred by the ASDA Group from Equal Value Claims filed with employment tribunals, up to an agreed cap. As a result of these indemnity arrangements, even if the ASDA Group is ultimately unsuccessful in defending any of the Equal Value Claims, we do not believe that such an outcome would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or results of operations nor our ability to meet our debt service obligations, including on the Notes, or other financial obligations as they become due. As of September 30, 2020, the Company had no material off balance sheet arrangements or funding arrangements that would be classified as a contingent liability under IFRS, except for a contingent liability relating to the ongoing Equal Value Claims. With respect to these claims, the Company has not recognised a provision on the basis that any loss or range of loss that may arise from these proceedings cannot be reasonably estimated and any potential liability is only a possible obligation, as it has yet to be confirmed whether the entity has a present obligation that could lead to an outflow of resources embodying economic 222 ----- benefits. See note 13 (""Contingent liabilities"") of the Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for further information on contingent liabilities. See ""Business—Legal Proceedings—Equal _Value Litigation"" and ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters—From time to time we and/or our management are subject to claims that can result in litigation, arbitration, tax or regulatory proceedings which could distract management from our business activities and result in significant liability.""_ 223 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The services are expected to comprise all information technology and telecommunications services (and related operational system processes) that Walmart Group Companies provided to the ASDA Group in the 12 months prior to the Acquisition Completion Date, and each such service is expected to be supplied by Walmart until the earlier of (i) migration of the relevant service as part of the separation of ASL from Walmart; and (ii) termination of the TSA in accordance with its terms by one of the parties (as summarised below). The services are arranged into six categories (referred to as ""service towers,"" which relate to stores, supply chain, merchandising, back office, e-commerce and infrastructure/security) for charging and migration purposes. ASL is expected to have the right to terminate any service tower, or the TSA in its entirety, on three months' notice. In addition, either party is expected to have the right to terminate the TSA following the insolvency of its counterparty or a material breach of the terms of the TSA (subject to a notice requirement and a 30-day cure period, to the extent applicable). The TSA is expected to include customary warranties concerning the corporate existence and capacity of the parties and an undertaking to provide information and participate in discussions in connection with the delivery of the services. Walmart is expected to agree to provide each service to a standard and in a manner that is consistent with Walmart's provision of the equivalent service in the 12 months prior to the Acquisition Completion Date. Walmart is not expected to be required to provide the services to, or to meet, any more onerous standard or service level. Walmart is expected to be required to use reasonable endeavours to obtain and maintain third-party consents that are required for the provision of the services. Where a third-party consent is not obtained or maintained, Walmart is not expected to be required to provide the relevant service (and the TSA will terminate in respect of the relevant service without liability on the part of Walmart) and the parties will work together to agree a workaround (including replacement, in-sourcing or early migration) in order to enable ASL to continue to receive the benefit of the affected service. All reasonable one-off or ongoing costs of obtaining and maintaining third-party consents or implementing workarounds are to be borne by ASL, subject to Walmart consulting with ASL before incurring these costs. The TSA is expected to require ASL and Walmart to agree to a separation plan within 120 days after the Acquisition Completion Date and cooperate in achieving separation. Separation costs (excluding internal costs of the Walmart Group) are to be borne by ASL. The charges for the TSA services for the first year following the Acquisition Completion Date are expected to be initially equal to and are capped at £142 million (excluding any VAT) (which the TSA is expected to state has been calculated according to the actual amount of the 2019 intra-group charges 233 ----- incurred by the ASDA Group in respect of the equivalent services), subject to specified adjustments set out in the TSA, and the cap on service charges subsequently rises by 1% per year thereafter. The charges payable for services in subsequent years are expected to be equal to the charges for such services for the previous contract year (subject to any reduction as summarised below) subject to an inflationary increase of 2% per year. The charges per service tower are split on a fixed cost and variable cost basis. The variable proportion of the charges is expected to reduce to the extent that ASL is able to achieve certain agreed milestones in its separation plan and ramp down usage of the relevant service tower. If ASL requires any service to be provided beyond a long stop date of three years from the Acquisition Completion Date, the charges for any remaining services will ratchet up by 10% every six months. The liability of the parties under the TSA is expected to be limited, where service-specific, to the amount of fees paid or payable in respect of the relevant service tower during the relevant contract year. In the case of liabilities that are not related to a specific service tower, the liability of the parties under the TSA is expected to be limited to the total amount of fees paid or payable during the relevant contract year. Each party's aggregate liability for each contract year is expected to be limited to the amount of fees paid or payable during the relevant contract year. These limitations are expected to be subject to limited exceptions, including in the case of fraud. Neither party is expected to be liable for any indirect or consequential losses or loss of profit or loss of revenue and, to the extent Walmart's breach is caused by a third-party default, Walmart's maximum liability to ASL is expected to be limited to the amount that Walmart can recover from the third party (or an equitable proportion thereof to reflect the loss suffered by the ASDA Group as compared to the Walmart Group).

ASDA Group entities which own the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, Substitute Retail Assets, and hold Designated Bank Accounts, will be third-party security providers under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. Under the terms of the IEO, we will not be permitted to distribute any assets (including the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets, the Substitute Retail Assets (to the extent applicable) and the balances credited to the Designated Bank Accounts) until the Acquisition is approved by the CMA on the CMA Clearance Date, and there can be no assurance that the CMA will approve the Acquisition. See ""Risk _Factors—Risk Factors Related to the Transactions—The Acquisition is subject to certain uncertainties and risks,_ _which could adversely impact recoveries under the Notes."" Following the CMA Clearance Date, the_ terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility require us to transfer the Warehouse Assets and certain Select Retail Assets and, if required to replace any Affected Warehouses, one of more Substitute Retail Assets with a value or aggregate value approximately equal to the value of the Affected Warehouse(s) from the ASDA Group to Propco 2, an affiliate or the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, which we intend to do by way of a transfer for consideration left outstanding, as described in ""The Transactions—The Post Completion Disposals."" Certain Select Retail Assets and, as relevant, Substitute Retail Assets may remain held by the ASDA Group but will continue to be charged in favour of the Lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility as described in the paragraph below. Following the date of completion of the Forecourt Business Disposal, (to the extent the Post-Completion Disposals were made to Propco 2, rather than to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, following the CMA Clearance Date) the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will require Midco 2 to transfer the entire share capital of Propco 1 to the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, in consideration of repayment of the amounts then outstanding under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Proceeds Loan. The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is guaranteed by the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower, Propco 1, Propco 2 and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower's direct parent entity, Bellis Noncore 1 Limited. The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility is secured by (i) a first-ranking pledge granted by Bellis Noncore 1 Limited over the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower's share capital, (ii) a first ranking pledge granted by Propco 1 over Propco 2's share capital, (iii) first-ranking security over the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower's rental account, (iv) firstranking security over Propco 2's rental account, (v) first-ranking mortgages, fixed charges or, as applicable, standard securities, over the Warehouse Assets and the Select Retail Assets and, if required to replace any Affected Warehouses, one of more Substitute Retail Assets with a value or aggregate value approximately equal to the value of the Affected Warehouse(s), (vi) a first ranking pledge granted by ASDA entities over the Designated Bank Accounts (being the blocked accounts into which payments of rent under the ASDA Leases in respect of Warehouse Assets and the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, Substitute Retail Assets are prescribed to be made) and (vii) a first-ranking assignment granted by each ASDA Propco over the proceeds of insurances, Rental Income (including any amount received pursuant to any guarantee of Rental Income) and net property disposal proceeds. Prior to the PostCompletion Disposals, the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility' lenders' recourse to the Issuers and 270 ----- the Restricted Subsidiaries will be limited to the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets, to the extent required in the event that there is one or more Affected Warehouse, one or more Substitute Retail Assets, and the Designated Bank Accounts, which will be mortgaged or charged (or the equivalent), as applicable, for the exclusive benefit of these lenders and the other secured parties under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. After the Post-Completion Disposals, which will occur on or about the CMA Clearance Date, the lenders under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility will have no recourse to the Issuers, the Guarantors, any of the Issuers' Restricted Subsidiaries or any other Subsidiary of Topco and their claims will be structurally subordinated to the Notes and the Notes Guarantees. Upon transfer of the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets, the balances credited to the Designated Bank Accounts and, to the extent applicable, one or more Substitute Retail Assets to Propco 2 (or a relevant affiliate), Propco 2 (or such affiliate) shall immediately grant first ranking legal mortgages (or, as applicable, fixed charges or standard securities) over the Warehouses and Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower (unless such assets are transferred to Propco 2 or any other relevant affiliate subject to the mortgages (or, as applicable, standard securities) created by the Third-Party Asset Security). In addition, monies held in the Designated Bank Accounts will be transferred to Propco 2's (or such affiliate's) rental account in respect of which security will be granted to secure the obligations of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility.

The Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has no scheduled amortisation, and the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower intends to repay it in full ahead of maturity with the net proceeds from certain asset sales (primarily the Warehouse Sale Transactions and, depending on market conditions and expected transaction values, sales of the Select Retail Assets (subject to the ASDA Leases) and, to the extent applicable, some or all of the Substitute Retail Assets (subject to the ASDA Leases)). The net proceeds of the sale of Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, the Substitute Retail Assets, are required to be applied within three business days of receipt of such proceeds in mandatory prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. We anticipate that the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower will return to the Issuers or any of the Guarantors, by way of contribution to the equity, in-kind loan pursuant to a deeply subordinated instrument or repayment of Post-Completion Disposal Receivables, any Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, any Substitute Retail Assets that it does not sell, and (to the extent not already applied in mandatory prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility) an amount equal to any net proceeds from the sale of the Select Retail Assets and, to the extent applicable, any Substitute Retail Assets (including any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds), in each case promptly after the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has been discharged in full and, under the terms of the Notes, the relevant Issuer is required to procure this contribution.

This ""Description of the Senior Secured Notes"" is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Senior Secured Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are available from us upon request, and following the Issue Date, copies of such documents will be made available upon request to holders of Senior Secured Notes, as described in more detail under ""Listing and _General Information.""_ 274 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.2,Acquisition Agreement; Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds,60.2.1,,"Pursuant to the acquisition agreement dated October 2, 2020 (the ""Acquisition Agreement"") between Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited, an indirect subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer formed for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions (the ""Purchaser""), and ASDA Holdings UK Limited, the Purchaser agreed to acquire all of the issued ordinary shares of the Company. We intend to settle the Offering on            (the ""Issue Date""), which we currently expect to be after the date of consummation of the Acquisition (the ""Completion Date""). In this case, on the Completion Date, the Issuers are expected to draw £700 million (equivalent) in loans under the Senior Bridge Facility and £1,400 million (equivalent) in loans under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement. On the Issue Date, we will then use the proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes together with the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes to repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Bridge Facility and the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities. See ""Use of Proceeds."" In this case, on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and will be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Company and ASDA Stores Limited (the ""Initial Guarantors""). It is, however, possible that the Completion Date may be delayed until after the Issue Date, including due to the timing of our receipt of the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. In this case, unless the Offering is completed substantially concurrently with the Completion Date, we will fund the gross proceeds of the Offering into escrow, as further described below and, on the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes will be obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer only and will not be guaranteed on a senior basis by the Initial Guarantors until the Completion Date. In such circumstances, the Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be controlled by Walmart prior the Completion Date. We cannot assure you that Walmart will operate ASDA's business during the interim period in the same way that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer would and we cannot assure you that, following the Completion Date, the Company will operate its business in the same way that Walmart has operated the business in the past. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Completion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, had those covenants been applicable to such entities after the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date. If this Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the Acquisition, we will forego the escrow procedures described above and will instead retain the proceeds of the Offering to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement on the Completion Date. See ""Use of Proceeds."" In any event, as contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition will be completed during the pendency of the review of the Acquisition by the CMA, and the CMA's review remains ongoing. In connection with its review of the Acquisition, the CMA is expected to issue an IEO, which we expect to remain in force until the CMA Clearance Date. Under this IEO, neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any Parent will be permitted to exercise control over the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise direct their operations until the CMA Clearance Date. Accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Parents will not be able to direct the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply with the covenants described in this ""Description of the Senior Secured Notes"" until the CMA Clearance Date, and the Company and its material subsidiaries will have no contractual obligation to comply with these covenants until each of these entities accedes to Senior Secured Notes Indenture on the applicable date, which will be on or after the Completion Date. Nevertheless, the covenants described herein will apply to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries from the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date, and any failure to comply with these covenants will constitute a Default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. _Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption_ If the Offering is consummated prior to, and not substantially concurrently with or after, the Completion Date, the Initial Purchasers will deposit, on the Issue Date, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of this offering and sale of the Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date into one or more escrow accounts (such proceeds, the ""Escrowed Proceeds"" and such accounts, collectively, the ""Escrow Accounts"") pursuant to the terms of one or more escrow agreements (each an ""Escrow Agreement"" and together, the ""Escrow Agreements"") to be dated as of the Issue Date among the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch (in such capacity, the ""Escrow Agent""). The Escrowed Proceeds deposited in each of the Escrow Accounts will be held in the name of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, but will be controlled by the Escrow Agent. The Escrowed Proceeds, and all other funds and payments credited to the Escrow Accounts (less any property and/or funds released in accordance with each Escrow Agreement) are referred to, collectively, as the ""Escrowed Property."" The Senior Secured Notes Issuer's rights with respect to the Escrow Accounts, together with the 275 ----- Escrowed Property, will be pledged in favour of the Trustee on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Holders of Senior Secured Notes on the Issue Date (such charges to be documented under one or more English law governed security agreements (the ""Escrow Account Charges"") among the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Trustee to be dated on or before the Issue Date). Under the terms of the Escrow Agreements, amounts may be released from the Escrow Accounts prior to the Completion Date to pay accrued interest on the Senior Secured Notes on any interest payment date in respect thereof occurring prior to the Escrow Release Date. Each Holder, by accepting a Senior Secured Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the applicable Escrow Agreement or Escrow Agreements, as applicable, and the Escrow Account Charges and to have irrevocably authorised and directed the Trustee and the Escrow Agent to take all actions set forth in the Escrow Agreements in the event it is executed without the need for further direction from them under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Changes or other modifications to the Escrow Agreements and the Escrow Account Charges can be made either with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of Senior Secured Notes then outstanding or without the consent of Holders, if such changes or other modifications will not, individually or when taken as whole, adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect. _Release of Escrowed Proceeds in connection with the consummation of Acquisition_ In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to, or to pay it at the instruction of, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (the ""Release""), the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, at a time that is on or before April 30, 2022 (the ""Outside",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Under the terms of each Escrow Agreement, the Release shall occur promptly upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth above (the date of such satisfaction, the ""Escrow Release Date""). Upon any such Release, the balance of the Escrow Accounts shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall be released in accordance with each Escrow Agreement. Receipt by the Trustee of such Officer's Certificate shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee to the release of the Escrowed Property from the charges documented under the Escrow Account Charges. _Special Mandatory Redemption_ Pursuant to one or more shortfall agreements (the ""Shortfall Agreements"") to be entered into on or prior to the Issue Date between the Issuers and Bellis Midco Limited (""Midco""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Topco and a Holding Company of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer, Midco will be required to contribute to the Escrow Accounts and the corresponding escrow accounts for the Senior Notes, up to the maximum aggregate amount of £20.0 million, an amount in cash expected to equal the sum of (i) interest accrued on the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes from the Issue Date, and (ii) any Additional Amounts or corresponding additional amounts for the Senior Notes, in each case, to March 31, 2021 (the ""Shortfall Agreement Termination Date""), which is the date by which we expect to have received the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. A bank of international standing (the ""Issuing Bank"") will guarantee Midco's obligations under the Shortfall Agreements by delivering to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer, on the Issue Date, an irrevocable letter of credit or on demand guarantee (the ""On-Demand Guarantee"") expiring on March 31, 2021. Pursuant to the On-Demand Guarantee, each of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Issuer will be entitled to draw funds from the Issuing Bank to make up the relevant escrow shortfall, upon request made no later than March 31, 2021 and up to the maximum aggregate amount of £20.0 million. If the Acquisition and the Release have not occurred by March 31, 2021, Midco shall be entitled to extend the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date unilaterally, at its discretion, by procuring that all of the following actions take place: (a) Midco shall have increased its commitment to contribute cash to the Escrow Accounts and the corresponding escrow accounts for the Senior Notes under the Shortfall Agreements to an amount expected to equal the sum of (i) interest accrued on the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes from April 1, 2021, and (ii) any Additional Amounts or corresponding additional amounts for the Senior Notes, 276 ----- in each case, to a date chosen by Midco that is not later than the Outside Date, (b) the Issuing Bank shall have increased its original commitment under the On-Demand Guarantee by the same amount set forth in clause (a), and (c) the expiry date of the On-Demand Guarantee shall have been extended to, and be the same as, the extended Shortfall Termination Date. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will promptly deliver notice of any extension of the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, confirming that all actions described in the preceding clauses (a), (b) and (c) have been completed. Midco may decide to extend the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date on one or more occasions, at its discretion, up to (but no later than) the Outside Date under the Escrow Agreement. The Shortfall Agreements will terminate and be of no further force and effect upon the Release. In the event that (a) the Escrow Release Date does not take place on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) in the reasonable judgment of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated by the Outside Date, (c) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Outside Date, (d) an Event of Default arises under clause (5) of the first paragraph under ""—Events of Default"" on or prior to the Outside Date with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or (e) the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date occurs on or prior to the Outside Date and at a time when the Escrow Release Date has not yet taken place (the date of any such event being the ""Special Termination Date""), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will redeem all of the Senior Secured Notes (the ""Special Mandatory",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

See ""—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Indebtedness"" and_ _""—Certain Definitions— _Indebtedness.""_ In addition, as described below under ""—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees"" and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees any Indebtedness Incurred under any Syndicated Term Facilities, any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination or any Public Debt shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Secured Notes. 281 ----- The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favour of obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference rules, ""thin capitalisation"" rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, where the time and cost of granting the guarantee or security would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders or where security would be granted over the Capital Stock, liabilities, property or other assets of any member of the Regulated Group. Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise stipulated under the Agreed Security Principles, including to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our _Financing and Our Indebtedness—Each Notes Guarantee and security interest will be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable law or subject to certain defences that_ _may limit its validity and enforceability,"" ""—The insolvency laws of England and Wales and other jurisdictions may not be as favourable to you as the U.S. bankruptcy laws and may preclude holders of the Notes from recovering payments due on the Notes"" and ""Certain Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests.""_ The Notes Guarantee of a Guarantor will terminate and release: (1) upon a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (whether by direct sale or sale of a holding company) or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the Guarantor (other than to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; (2) upon the designation in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture of the Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary; (3) upon becoming a member of the Regulated Group; (4) upon payment in full of principal, interest and all other obligations on the Senior Secured Notes or upon legal defeasance, covenant defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, as provided in ""—Defeasance"" and ""—Satisfaction and Discharge""; (5) with respect to a Guarantor that is not a Significant Subsidiary, so long as no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, to the extent that such Guarantor (i) is unconditionally released and discharged from its liability with respect to the Senior Credit Facilities and (ii) does not guarantee any Syndicated Term Facility or any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination or Public Debt; (6) pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including as described under ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement—Provisions _Following an IPO"");_ (7) as described under ""—Amendments and Waivers""; (8) as described in the first paragraph of the covenant described below under ""—Certain _Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees"";_ (9) as a result of a transaction permitted by ""—Certain Covenants—Merger and _Consolidation—The _Guarantors""; or_ (10) in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation. Upon the request of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall take all reasonably necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications. Each of the releases set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee and the Security Agent, as applicable, upon receipt of customary documentation under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and without the consent of the Holders or any other action or consent on the part of the Trustee or the Security Agent. 282 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Additionally, the Issuer Share Collateral, the Senior Financing Proceeds Loan and any other material intra-group receivables owing to the Senior Notes Issuer by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (collectively, the ""Shared Security"") will also secure the Senior Notes Issuer's obligations under the Senior Notes on a second priority basis. The proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral may not be sufficient to satisfy the obligations owed to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. No appraisals of the Collateral have been made in connection with this Offering of the Senior Secured Notes, with the exception of the Brokers' Opinions of Pricing described in this Offering Memorandum. By its nature, some or all of the Collateral will be illiquid and may have no readily ascertainable market value.

Such documents provide, among other things, that under certain circumstances, including a repayment in full of the amounts outstanding under term facilities under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the Revolving Credit Facilities, certain Hedging Obligations and certain other Indebtedness permitted to be secured on a super priority basis may be re-designated as ""super senior"" obligations under the Intercreditor Agreement, and following such re-designation, Holders will only receive proceeds from the enforcement of the Collateral after the obligations under such other Indebtedness have been paid in full.

These limitations are described under ""Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement"" and ""Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests."" The ability_ to enforce the Security Interests may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will provide) for circumstances in which the Holders of the Senior Notes may instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in respect of such Security Interests including if, among other things, a default under the Senior Notes is continuing following the expiry of a Senior Notes enforcement standstill period (being a period of up to 179 days), provided that (other than in the case of an event of default which has occurred under the Senior Notes as a result of failure to pay principal at final maturity) no such enforcement action may be taken against a debtor or any of its subsidiaries if enforcement action is being taken by the Security Agent against that debtor in respect of Shared Security on the instructions of an instructing group which the proposed Senior Notes enforcement action might reasonably be expected to adversely affect. _Agreed Security Principles_ The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of Notes Guarantees and security in favour of obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and are substantially similar to the agreed security principles appended to the Senior Facilities Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of Notes Guarantees and security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, ""thin capitalisation"" rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, where the time and cost of granting the guarantee or security would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders or where security would be granted over the Capital Stock, property or other assets, or liabilities of a member of the Regulated Group. In this ""Agreed Security Principles"" section only, any reference to ""Acquired Person **or** **Asset,"" ""Agent,"" ""Debtor,"" ""Finance Document,"" ""Secured Debt Document,"" or ""Secured Parties"" is a reference to that term as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date. See ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement."" General Principles The guarantees and security required to be provided under the Secured Debt Documents will be given in accordance with the security principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles. The description that follows identifies the Agreed Security Principles and addresses the manner in which the Agreed Security Principles will impact on and determine the extent and terms of the guarantees, including the Notes Guarantees, and security proposed to be provided under or pursuant to any Secured Debt Document, including the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes and the Security Documents. (a) The Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining effective or commercially reasonable Notes Guarantees and/or security from all relevant members of the Group in each jurisdiction in which it has been agreed that Notes Guarantees and security will be granted by those members. In particular: (i) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, ""transfer pricing,"" ""thin capitalisation,"" ""earnings stripping,"" ""controlled foreign corporation"" and other tax restrictions, ""exchange control restrictions,"" ""capital maintenance"" rules and ""liquidity impairment"" rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a Notes Guarantee or security or may require that the Notes Guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the Notes Guarantee or security will be limited accordingly, provided that to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such Notes Guarantee or Security Document shall be subject to such limit; (ii) a key factor in determining whether or not a Notes Guarantee or security will be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable legal fees) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties of obtaining such Notes Guarantee or security; 286 ----- (iii) members of the Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or enter into Security Documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable Security Document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such Notes Guarantee or Security Document shall be subject to such limit; (iv) Notes Guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed between the grantor of the security and the Security Agent; (v) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material assets only; (vi) it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets; (vii) any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, licence, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable Security Document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable Security Document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a Notes Guarantee or Security Document, _provided_ that, reasonable endeavours (exercised for a specified period of time and without incurring material cost or instigating legal proceedings) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security or accession document that the asset is material and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is satisfied that such endeavours will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy; (viii) the giving of a Notes Guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this clause (viii); (ix) any Security Document will only be required to be notarised if required by law in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence; (x) no Notes Guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any Acquired Person or Asset (and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support acquired indebtedness to the extent such acquired indebtedness is permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition not prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be required to become a guarantor or grant security with respect to any Secured Debt Document if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing that acquired indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness or any Refinancing Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; no security will be granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any permitted Indebtedness and/or to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement; (xi) to the extent possible and unless required by applicable law, there should be no action required to be taken in relation to the Notes Guarantee or the Collateral when any Holder assigns or transfers any of its Senior Secured Notes to a new Holder (and, unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any Security Document, no member of the Group shall bear 287 ----- or otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial, registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from any assignment or transfer by a Holder); (xii) (other than the Real Estate Reports) no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required and any security shall take subject to any matters registered against the title to the assets as at the date of the relevant security or to which the security is otherwise legally subject; (xiii) security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favour of a third party (other than in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the creation of Security Interests over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant Security Document); (xiv) to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favour of the Security Agent and not the Secured Parties individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of Security Documents for all the Secured Parties); ""parallel debt"" provisions will be used where necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual Security Documents); no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any Notes Guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a Secured Party; (xv) Notes Guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group; (xvi) each Security Document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction not prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security granted under each Security Document entered into after the Completion Date shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant Security Document and creation of the relevant security; (xvii) no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement; (xviii) the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the Secured Debt Documents prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing; (xix) no Notes Guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any ""Excluded Swap Obligations"" defined in accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled ""Swap _Regulations' Implications for Loan Documentation,"" and any update thereto by the LSTA;_ (xx) other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group; and (xxi) no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will be required to be prepared or provided to the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time), unless (i) required for such documents to become effective or admissible in evidence and (ii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. (b) Notwithstanding any term of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document, no Senior Secured Note, Notes Guarantee or other obligation under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document may be, directly or indirectly: (i) guaranteed by a ""controlled foreign corporation"" (as defined in Section 957(a) of the Internal Revenue Code) that is owned by a member of the Group that is a US Person (such entity owned by a member of the Group that is a US Person, a ""CFC"") or by an entity (a ""FSHCO"") substantially all the assets of which consist of equity interests (or equity interests and indebtedness) of one or more CFCs, or guaranteed by a subsidiary of a CFC or FSHCO; (ii) secured by any assets of a CFC, FSHCO or a subsidiary of a CFC or a FSHCO (including any CFC or FSHCO equity interests held directly or indirectly by a CFC or FSHCO); (iii) secured by a pledge or other security interest in excess of 65% of the voting equity interests (and 100% of the non-voting equity interests) of a CFC or FSHCO; or (iv) guaranteed by any subsidiary or secured by a pledge of or security interest in any subsidiary or other asset, if it would result in material adverse US tax consequences as reasonably determined by the grantor of the security or Guarantor (as applicable) and the Trustee or any other Agent. 288 ----- Guarantees Subject to the guarantee limitations set out in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, each Notes Guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee for all liabilities of the Debtors under the Secured Debt Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction (references to ""security"" to be read for this purpose as including the Notes Guarantees and guarantees provided pursuant to any other Finance Document). Security documents will secure the guarantee obligations of the relevant security provider or, if such security is provided on a third party basis, all liabilities of the Debtors under the Secured Debt Documents, in each case in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of these Agreed Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction. Governing law and scope of security (a) No security or Notes Guarantees shall be required to be given by (or shares or investments in) any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another member of the Group. (b) The parties agree that the overriding intention, subject to clause (a) above, is for security only to be granted by and shall be limited to: (i) the Senior Notes Issuer, on a limited recourse third party basis, in respect of the shares it holds in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and all intercompany loans owed to it by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in respect of the assets described in (c), (d) and (e) of the first paragraph under the caption ""—Security—General""; (iii) Guarantors in respect only over: (A) their material bank accounts (without control over use) located in the United Kingdom, any jurisdiction of incorporation of a Material Subsidiary and any jurisdiction of incorporation of a borrower under the Senior Facilities Agreement (each of the foregoing, a ""Security",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Share security over any subsidiary will be governed by the law of the place of incorporation of that subsidiary. Any security over a structural intercompany loan granted to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be governed by the governing law of such structural intra-group loan document.

Bank accounts (a) If a member of the Group grants security over its material bank accounts it will be free to deal, operate and transact business in relation to those accounts (including opening and closing accounts) until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing (unless the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents expressly provide for any specific account (by reference to its purpose) to be subject to specific restrictions on use). For the avoidance of doubt (unless the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents expressly provide for any specific account (by reference to its purpose) to be subject to specific restrictions on use), there will be no ""fixed"" security over bank accounts, cash or receivables or any obligation to hold or pay cash or receivables in a particular account unless the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes have become immediately due and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. (b) Where ""fixed"" security is required in accordance with paragraph (a) above, if required by local law to perfect the security and it is possible to give such notice of security without disrupting the operation of 290 ----- the account(s) in question, notice of the security will be served on the account bank in relation to applicable accounts within 10 Business Days of the date of the Security Document (or accession thereto) and the applicable grantor of the security will use its reasonable endeavours to obtain an acknowledgement of that notice within 20 Business Days of service. If the grantor of the security has used its reasonable endeavours but has not been able to obtain acknowledgement or acceptance, its obligation to obtain acknowledgement will cease on the expiry of that 20 Business Day period. Irrespective of whether notice of the security is required for perfection, if the service of notice would prevent any member of the Group from using a bank account in the course of its business, no notice of security will be served unless the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Secured Notes have become immediately due and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. (c) Any security over bank accounts will be subject to any security interests in favour of the account bank which are created either by law or in the standard terms and conditions of the account bank. No grantor of security will be required to change its banking arrangements or standard terms and conditions in connection with the granting of bank account security. (d) If required under applicable local law, security over bank accounts will be registered subject to the general principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles. (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no security shall be required to be granted over, or in respect of, any Designated Bank Account. Real Property (a) Except as contemplated by the Overriding Principle, there shall be no requirement to grant any security over real property in the United Kingdom. There shall be no requirement to grant security over real property not located in the United Kingdom. (b) There shall be no restrictions in any Security Document restricting members of the Group from transferring, leasing or otherwise disposing of real estate assets to other members of the Group (other than, in respect of Material Real Property which is required to comprise part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, security granted to other members of the Group, which shall be restricted in the manner contemplated by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture) or any third parties and, for the avoidance of doubt, no consent or approval shall be required under any Security Document from the Trustee or the Holders for any such transfers, leases or dispositions and the Security Agent shall be authorised to release any security over any real estate assets and provide such consent, approval or certificate that may be requested by any member of the Group in relation to such transfers, leases or dispositions without the need for any further consent or approval from the Trustee or the Holders to the extent the relevant transfer, lease or disposition is not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. (c) Where granting security over any real property would require obtaining consent from a third party, there shall be no requirement to grant security (including floating security to the extent such consent is required) over any such real property if such consent is not obtained. (d) Where granting security over any real property would require complying with or satisfying a restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of a third party, the relevant member of the Group shall, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost, instigating legal proceedings and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to comply with or satisfy such restriction, inhibition or arrangement following which, if the restriction, inhibition or arrangement in favour of the third party cannot be satisfied or complied with or the third party has not provided any consent, approval, certificate or other documentation required to register that security at HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), there shall be no requirement to grant security. (e) Where granting security over any real property would require complying with or satisfying a restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of or for the benefit of a third party that requires the Security Agent to enter into any document pursuant to that restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), if the Security Agent declines to enter into such document or requests modifications to the form of any such document (it being understood that the Security Agent is not obliged to enter into any such documentation that is not agreed with it and the Security Agent shall not be liable to any party for requesting modifications to the form of any such document or declining to enter into such document (acting reasonably)), there shall be no requirement to enter into negotiations regarding that document or to grant security over that real property. 291 ----- (f) Notwithstanding that a restriction, inhibition or arrangement has been satisfied or complied with in accordance with paragraph (d) above, if a third party has not provided any documentation or information required for dealing with any requisition raised by HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) that results in an application being cancelled, then no security shall be granted over that real property. (g) In relation to the Material Real Properties, where there is existing security registered on the title at HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), there shall be no requirement to apply for the removal of such registration unless such security was granted in respect of financing obtained from another member of the Group, ASDA Holdings UK Limited (the ""Vendor"") or any Affiliate of the Vendor or a financial institution, credit institution, insurance broker or pension fund in their capacity as lenders. (h) Where the Security Agent has the benefit of a restriction or inhibition (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) on the title of a property, it shall provide its consent, approval, certificate or release in the form required by HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), to allow any matter that is not prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement as soon as possible and in any event within 10 Business Days of request by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer accompanied by a certification by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that such matter is not prohibited under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no security shall be required to be granted over, or in respect of, any Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets. Fixed assets Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if a member of the Group grants security over its material fixed assets it will be free to deal with those assets in the course of its business until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. No notice, whether to third parties or by attaching a notice to the fixed assets, will be prepared or given until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. Insurance policies (a) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, a member of the Group may grant security over its material insurance policies (excluding any third party liability or public liability insurance and any directors and officers insurance in respect of which claims thereunder may be mandatorily prepaid, provided that the relevant insurance policy allows security to be so granted). Notice of any security interest over insurance policies will only be served on an insurer of the Group assets upon written request of the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Trustee or another Agent), which may only be given after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. (b) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing, no loss payee or other endorsement will be made on the insurance policy and no Secured Party will be named as co-insured. Intellectual property (a) No security will be granted over any intellectual property which cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant licencing agreement. (b) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if security is granted over the relevant material intellectual property, the grantor shall be free to deal with, use, licence and otherwise commercialise those assets in the course of its business (including allowing its intellectual property to lapse if no longer material to its business) until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. (c) Notice of any security interest over intellectual property will only be served on a third party from whom intellectual property is licensed upon written request of the Security Agent, which may only be given after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. No intellectual property security will be required to be registered under the law of that Security Document, the law where the grantor is regulated, or at any relevant supra-national registry. Security over intellectual property rights will be taken on an ""as is, where is"" basis and the Group will not be required to procure any changes to, or corrections of filings on, external registers. Receivables (a) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor grants security over any of its receivables it will be free to deal with, amend, waive or terminate those receivables in the course of its business until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. No notice of security may be prepared or served until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing (other than security over structural intra-group loans). Any list of receivables provided will not include details of the underlying contracts (but may include non-sensitive generic information to the extent 292 ----- that would allow for the creation of security) and will not be required to be updated after the delivery of the first list by any Material Subsidiary. If required under local law, security over receivables will be registered subject to the general principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no security shall be required to be granted over, or in respect of, any Post-Completion Disposal Receivables. Shares (a) Security over shares, stocks or partnership interests will be limited to those over the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Material Subsidiary which is a Guarantor. (b) Until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the legal title of the shares will remain with the relevant grantor of the security (unless transfer of title on granting such security is customary in the applicable jurisdiction) and any grantor of share security shall be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights and powers in relation to any shares and other related rights charged by it and receive, own and retain all assets and proceeds in relation thereto without restriction or condition, provided that any exercise of rights does not materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Security Interest over the shares or cause an Event of Default to occur. (c) Where customary and applicable as a matter of law, on, or as soon as reasonably practicable and after execution (and taking into account any stamping requirements in respect of any stock transfer form (or applicable law equivalent)) of that security or accession document, the applicable share certificate (or other documents evidencing title to the relevant shares) and a stock transfer form executed in blank (or applicable law equivalent) will be provided to the Security Agent.

(b) If a member of the Group is or becomes a member of the Regulated Group, the Security Agent and/or the relevant Secured Parties (as applicable) shall, at the cost and request of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, promptly release any Collateral over the shares, assets or liabilities of (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any asset of another member of the Group which corresponds to a liability of such member of the Regulated Group) and Notes Guarantees provided by, such member of the Regulated Group without further consent or approval from the Trustee or the Holders. _Security Documents_ Under the Security Documents, security will be granted over the Collateral to secure the payment when due of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's payment obligations under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. The Security Documents will be entered into among, _inter alios, the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Senior Secured Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Secured Notes except through the Trustee under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral. Under the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility, the trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture, the holders of the Senior Notes and the counterparties under certain hedging agreements in relation to the Security Interests in favour of such parties.

If any challenge to the validity of the Security Interest or the terms of 293 ----- the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement were successful, the Holders might not be able to recover any amounts under the Security Documents.

In addition, prior to              2023, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem all or, from time to time, a part of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes redeemed, plus the Applicable Premium and accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). _Tender Offers_ Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any tender offer for any series of Senior Secured Notes (including, without limitation, any Change of Control Offer and any Asset Disposition Offer), if Holders of Senior Secured Notes of such series of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes of such series validly tender and do not withdraw such Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any third party making such a tender offer in lieu of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, purchases all of the Senior Secured Notes of such series validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, all of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes of such series will be deemed to have consented to such tender or other offer and, accordingly, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such third party will have the right upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such tender offer expiration date, to redeem the Senior 297 ----- Secured Notes of such series that remain outstanding in whole, but not in part (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) following such purchase at a price equal to the price (excluding any early tender fee) offered to each other Holder of Senior Secured Notes in such tender offer, plus, to the extent not included in the tender offer payment, accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, thereon, to, but excluding, such redemption date. In determining whether the Holders of at least 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Secured Notes of any series have validly tendered and not validly withdrawn such Senior Secured Notes in a tender offer, Senior Secured Notes owned by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Affiliates or by funds controlled or managed by any Affiliate of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or any successor thereof, shall be deemed to be outstanding for the purposes of such tender offer. _General_ Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under ""—Selection and Notice"" below. Except for a redemption pursuant to ""—Redemption for Taxation Reasons,"" any redemption may, in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent. If such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's discretion, the redemption date may be delayed or extended until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed, in each case, as so notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the Holders; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person, and such notice of redemption may be extended if such conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer by notice to the Holders; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Secured Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior Secured Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Secured Notes will be subject to redemption by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. If requested in writing by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the applicable Officer's Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited with the Trustee, Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) to the Holders prior to the applicable redemption date, provided, however, that Holders shall have received at least three Business Days' notice from the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Senior Secured Notes are represented by a Global Senior Secured Note deposited with a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of such clearing system. _Selection and Notice_ If less than all of the Senior Secured Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar (as applicable) will select Senior Secured Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Senior Secured Notes issued as Global Senior Secured Notes, based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection (such as by way of pool factor) in accordance with the then applicable procedures of the relevant clearing system), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange, clearing system or depositary requirements; provided, however, that no Senior Secured Note of £100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Secured 298 ----- Notes in integral multiples of £1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph. If any Senior Secured Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior Secured Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Senior Secured Note, redemption will be effected in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system (including by application of a pool factor) or an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Senior Secured Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior Secured Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Senior Secured Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Secured Notes or portions of Senior Secured Notes called for redemption. _Sinking Fund_ The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Senior Secured Notes, except as described under ""—Acquisition _Agreement; Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds."" Redemption at Maturity_ On, 2026, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will redeem the Senior Secured Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). _Redemption for Taxation Reasons_ The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may redeem any series of Senior Secured Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holders of the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a ""Tax Redemption Date"") (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all Additional Amounts (as defined below under ""—Withholding Taxes""), if any, then due and which will become due on the Tax Redemption Date, as a result of the redemption or otherwise, if any, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer determines in good faith that, as a result of: (1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings promulgated thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or (2) any amendment to, or change in an official application or interpretation of such laws, treaties, regulations, protocols or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction or a change in published administrative practice) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a ""Change in Tax Law""), a Payor (as defined below) is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of Senior Secured Notes would be, required to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such series of Senior Secured Notes (but, in the case of a Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such requirement cannot be made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or another Guarantor who can make such payment without the obligation to pay Additional Amounts) and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to the Payor (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be reasonable); provided that changing the jurisdiction of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not a reasonable measure for purposes of this section. Such Change in Tax Law must be announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under ""—Selection and Notice."" Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such 299 ----- payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any series of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognised standing to the effect that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders. _Open Market Purchases, Privately Negotiated Transactions, Tender Offers_ As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Permitted Holders, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Senior Secured Notes or derivative instruments related thereto, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our Indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material. Any such purchases may be with respect to a substantial amount of a particular class or series of debt, with the attendant reduction in the trading liquidity of such class or series.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

In addition, no Additional Amounts shall be paid with respect to a Holder who is a fiduciary or a partnership or any person other than the sole beneficial owner of the Senior Secured Notes, to the extent that the beneficiary or settler with respect to such fiduciary, the member of such partnership or the beneficial owner would not have been entitled to Additional Amounts had such beneficiary, settler, member or beneficial owner held such Senior Secured Notes directly. The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor's reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not obtained, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent.

The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely, without further inquiry, on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. Wherever in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes or this ""Description of the _Senior Secured Notes"" there is mentioned, in any context: (1) the payment of principal; (2) purchase prices_ in connection with a redemption of Senior Secured Notes; (3) interest; or (4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Senior Secured Notes or any Notes Guarantee, such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts to the extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof. The Payor will pay (and will indemnify the Holder for) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, court or documentary taxes, or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) or any other excise, property or similar taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) that arise in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from the execution, 301 ----- delivery or registration of any Senior Secured Notes, any Notes Guarantee, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or any other document or instrument in relation thereto (other than in each case, in connection with a transfer of the Senior Secured Notes after this Offering) or the receipt of any payments with respect thereto or any such taxes or similar charges or levies (including any related interest, penalties or additions to tax) imposed by any jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the Senior Secured Notes or any Notes Guarantee (limited, solely in the case of any such taxes or similar charges or levies attributable to the receipt of any payments with respect thereto, to any such taxes imposed in a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction that are not excluded under clauses (1) through (3) and (5) through (7) above or any combination thereof).

Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice (the ""Change of Control",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Secured Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Secured Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes or portions of the Senior Secured Notes being purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Senior Secured Notes, unless notation of the purchase of Senior Secured Notes is to be effected in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent the Global Senior Secured Notes, in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Secured Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, promptly 302 ----- authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Secured Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Secured Note will be in a principal amount that is at least £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Secured Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalisation or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder's right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase such Holder's Senior Secured Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Secured Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as described under ""—Optional Redemption,"" unless and until there is a default in the payment of the applicable redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control; provided, however, that such Change of Control Offer is conditional upon such Change of Control. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to this covenant. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may rely on any noaction letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer's ability to repurchase Senior Secured Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of events that constitute a Change of Control would result in Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility becoming immediately due and payable or subject to a mandatory prepayment. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See ""Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, _Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by each Indenture.""_ The definition of ""Change of Control"" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ""substantially all,"" there is no precise established definition of the phrase ""substantially all"" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ""substantially all"" of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes as a result of a Change of Control 303 ----- may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; (7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and (8) in the event that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments to Incur Indebtedness or any Lien pursuant to clauses (10), (28), (30) or (31) of the definition of ""Permitted Liens"" or any Permitted Collateral Lien, the Incurrence thereof for all purposes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, will, at the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's option, either (a) be determined on the date such commitments are entered into or increased pursuant to binding documentation or (b) be determined on the date such Indebtedness or Liens are Incurred. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to test Incurrence as described in sub-clause (a), the full amount of Indebtedness made available under such commitments (the ""Reserved Indebtedness Amount""), and the related Liens, will be deemed Incurred on the date of execution of such binding documentation and, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, the Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio or any other Indebtedness or Lien Incurrence test under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing, re-borrowing or issuance of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments thereunder will be permitted under this covenant and under the covenant described under ""—Limitation on Liens,"" irrespective of whether the same Incurrence test is met at the time of actual borrowing, re-borrowing or issuance of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments thereunder. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may revoke such election at any time and from time to time. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations initially not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this ""— _Limitation on Indebtedness."" Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding_ as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount or (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this ""— _Limitation on Indebtedness,"" the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not be permitted to designate such_ Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary and any such designation will not be deemed operative under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture). For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred or, at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, first committed pursuant to binding documentation; _provided_ that, (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable sterling-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded, so long as the principal amount (or, if issued with original issue discount, the aggregate issue price) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date or Incurred in connection with the Acquisition Transactions on the Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on either the Issue Date or the Completion Date, as applicable; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the pound sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. 309 ----- Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor unless such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Secured Notes and the applicable Notes Guarantee, if any, on substantially identical terms; _provided, however,_ that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness. _Limitation on Restricted Payments_ The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's or any Restricted Subsidiary's Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) except: (a) dividends or distributions payable in Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets, Substitute Retail Assets, balances credited to the Designated Bank Accounts or Post-Completion Disposal Receivables, in Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock), in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding; (b) dividends or distributions payable to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (and, in the case of any such Restricted Subsidiary making such dividend or distribution, to holders of its Capital Stock other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary on no more than a pro rata basis, measured by value); (c) dividends or distributions payable and loans or other advances made to the Senior Notes Issuer to fund payments of interest, premia, additional amounts or break costs in respect of the Senior Bridge Facility or Senior Notes issued on the Issue Date (or any refinancing Indebtedness thereof;

and (d) dividends or distributions payable to, payments on Subordinated Shareholder Funding held by, and loans or other advances made to, any Parent to fund payments of interest, premia or break costs in respect of Indebtedness (or any refinancing Indebtedness thereof) of such Parent if (x) such Indebtedness is, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, Guaranteed by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and (y) any net proceeds from such initial Indebtedness are, directly or indirectly, contributed to the equity of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form or otherwise lent to or received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form; provided that (i) any net proceeds described in sub-clause (y) above shall be excluded for purposes of increasing the amount available for distribution pursuant to clause (b)(ii) below and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the second paragraph of this covenant; (2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer held by Persons other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than in exchange for Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets, balances credited to the Designated Bank Accounts, Substitute Retail Assets, Post-Completion Disposal Receivables or Capital Stock of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock)); (3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, 310 ----- any Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal instalment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement, (b) any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ""—Limitation on _Indebtedness,"" and (c) any repayment or prepayment of Indebtedness Incurred under the Senior Bridge_ Facility, to the extent funded with Net Cash Proceeds of the Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date); (4) make any payment (other than by capitalisation of interest or payments made in Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets, Substitute Retail Assets, balances credited to the Designated Bank Accounts or Post-Completion Disposal Receivables) on or with respect to, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, any Subordinated Shareholder Funding, except as permitted by clause (1)(d) above; or (5) make any Restricted Investment in any Person, (any such dividend, distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, other acquisition, retirement or Restricted Investment referred to in clauses (1) through (5) are referred to herein as a ""Restricted Payment""), if: (a) at the time the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary makes any such Restricted Payment other than a Restricted Investment, (i) an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing (or would result immediately thereafter therefrom);

If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, within 360 days (or such period as provided in clause (H) below, if applicable) of the later of the date of consummation of such Asset Disposition and receipt of such Net Available Cash, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may use the Net Available Cash to: (A) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Senior Secured Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ""—Limitation _on _Indebtedness""; provided that (in respect of Senior Secured Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1)(iv) of_ the second paragraph of the covenant described under ""—Limitation _on Indebtedness"") the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be entitled to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem such Indebtedness that constitutes Public Debt only if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase Senior Secured Notes, in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer, in such an amount as would reduce the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes then outstanding in the same proportion as the aggregate principal amount of such other Indebtedness would be reduced by such prepayments, repayments, purchases or redemptions; (ii) unless included in (A)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) Senior Secured Notes or other Senior Secured Indebtedness that is Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be entitled to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem such other Senior Secured Indebtedness that constitutes Public Debt only if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase Senior Secured Notes, in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer, in such an amount as would reduce the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes then outstanding in the same proportion as the aggregate principal amount of such other Senior Secured Indebtedness would be reduced by such prepayments, repayments, purchases or redemptions; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets that do not constitute Collateral (in each case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); _provided that in the case of an Asset Disposition of assets comprising the Collateral, the Senior Secured_ Notes Issuer may prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Subordinated Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the Collateral only if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer first makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders of all outstanding Senior Secured Notes to purchase their Senior Secured Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer; (B) purchase any series of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such series of Senior Secured Notes, redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any series of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or by making an Asset Disposition Offer to all Holders of the Senior Secured Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below); (C) invest in any Replacement Assets; (D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Person engaged in a Similar Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, such Person is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; (E) make a capital expenditure; (F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a Similar Business; (G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or (H) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (A), (C), (D), (E) or (F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated 319 ----- as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated, and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 360-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date. The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth above constitutes ""Excess Proceeds."" Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. On the 361st day (or the 541[st ]day if a binding commitment as described in clause (H) is entered into) after an Asset Disposition, or such earlier time as the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds £50.0 million, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (""Asset Disposition Offer"") to all Holders and, to the extent the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects, to all or some holders of other outstanding Senior Secured Indebtedness that is Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and any such other Senior Secured Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price, in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, and, in respect of such other Senior Secured Indebtedness, of no more than 100% of the principal amount thereof, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase. The Asset Disposition Offer in respect of Senior Secured Notes will be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and Senior Secured Indebtedness that is Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (the ""Retained Declined Proceeds"") for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. If the aggregate amount of Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the tendering holders of Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness pro rata based on the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness so tendered and not properly withdrawn. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness tendered in an Asset Disposition Offer that is not denominated in sterling, such principal amount shall be converted into its Sterling Equivalent as of a date selected by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period or no more than five Business Days prior to the beginning of the Asset Disposition Offer Period. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Secured Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Secured Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Secured Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Secured Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency. The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Secured Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the ""Asset Disposition Offer",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,60,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR SECURED NOTES,60.26,"Period""). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the",60.26.1,"Topco to effect the Retail Assets Contribution.""",,N/A,as_expected,2021,739

No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the",60.26.2,,"""Asset Disposition Purchase Date""), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior Secured Notes and, to the extent it elects, Senior Secured Indebtedness required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to such offer (the ""Asset Disposition Offer Amount"") or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Secured Notes and Senior Secured Indebtedness that is Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness or portions of Senior Secured Notes and Senior Secured Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Secured Notes and such other Senior Secured Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. 320 ----- The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Senior Secured Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Secured Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer for purchase. Any Senior Secured Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred or returned in accordance with applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream) by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to the Holder thereof. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Secured Notes pursuant to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not consummate Sale and Leaseback Transactions with any Person (other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) that, when taken together with all Sale and Leaseback Transactions consummated since the Issue Date, would yield, in aggregate, gross proceeds of more than the lesser of (x) £1,200 million and (y) £1,400 million minus the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (12)(b) of the definition of ""Permitted Debt"" and outstanding at the time of determination. The provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's obligation to make an Asset Disposition Offer may be waived or modified with the consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes (with such consent, for the avoidance of doubt, to be considered effective if the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes of consenting Holders represents a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes as a whole and without regard to the level of consent obtained among Holders of each constituent series of Senior Secured Notes). _Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_ The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an ""Affiliate Transaction"") involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of 10% of Consolidated EBITDA and £120 million unless: (1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction, taken as a whole, are not materially less favourable to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction with a Person who is not an Affiliate at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm's-length dealings; and (2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of 20% of Consolidated EBITDA and £240 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above. The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to: (1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under ""— _Limitation on Restricted Payments,"" any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of_ the second paragraph of the covenant described under ""—Limitations on Restricted Payments"") or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the definition thereof);

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees); (6) (i) the Transactions, excluding the ASDA Leases, and (ii) the ASDA Leases, to the extent entered into or replaced or amended from time to time on terms substantially consistent with those described in this Offering Memorandum;

(8) transactions with customers, contractors, clients, franchisees, licensees, sub-licensees, crosslicensees, landlords (including superior landlords), lessors, sub-lessors, trade creditors, service providers, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management, or are on terms no less favourable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party; (9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or among the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity; (10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding;

provided that, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer intends to make a public announcement of the appointment of a new senior executive officer other than by means of a report pursuant to this clause (4), the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may delay furnishing such report to the Trustee until the day on which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer otherwise makes such public announcement.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Senior Secured Notes copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's website. All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as specified in the second succeeding paragraph, no report need include separate financial statements for the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer may satisfy its obligations under the preceding paragraphs of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual and quarterly reports or other information of the Company or any Parent of the Company, for so long as the Company or such Parent is either a Subsidiary or a Parent of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. To the extent that material differences exist between the management, business, assets, shareholding or results of operations or financial condition of such other reporting entity and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the annual and quarterly reports shall include a concise description and an unaudited reconciliation of such 324 ----- material differences. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. At any time that any of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this ""Reports"" covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. All reports provided pursuant to this ""Reports"" covenant shall be made in the English language. In the event that (i) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. Following an initial public offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity or the listing of such Capital Stock on a recognised stock exchange, the reporting obligations of the reporting entity pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange (other than with respect to delivery of a compliance certificate). _Merger and Consolidation_ The Senior Secured Notes Issuer The Senior Secured Notes Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless: (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ""Successor Company"") will be a Person organised and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Jersey, the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Senior Secured Notes Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (if any) and the Security Documents, as applicable; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ""—Limitation on Indebtedness"" or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and (4) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that execution and delivery of the binding documentation providing for such consolidation, merger or transfer and of such supplemental indenture (if any) do not result in a breach of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorised, executed and delivered and is a valid and binding agreement, enforceable against the Successor Company in accordance with its terms (in each case, in 325 ----- form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact. Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under ""—Limitation on Indebtedness."" For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer to any person other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which properties and assets, if held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes. There is no precise established definition of the phrase ""substantially all"" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve ""substantially all"" of the property or assets of a Person. The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this ""Merger _and Consolidation"" covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition_ if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has complied with the covenant described under ""—Limitation on Sales _of Assets and Subsidiary Stock"" or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary._ The Guarantors No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may: (1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation); (2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or (3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless: (A) the other Person is the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, becomes a Guarantor (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); (B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the Senior Secured Notes Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or (C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each case other than to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, _provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this heading ""—The Guarantors""_ shall not apply to the extent that compliance with clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or 326 ----- shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. _General_ The provisions set forth in this ""Merger and Consolidation"" covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) a Guarantor transferring all or part of its properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor in order to comply with any law, rule, regulation or order, recommendation or directions of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (iv) any consolidation or merger of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer into any Guarantor; provided that, if the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading ""—Senior Secured Notes Issuer"" shall apply to such transaction; (v) a Permitted Reorganisation or the solvent liquidation of any Restricted Subsidiary; (vi) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organised for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; provided, however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading ""—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer"" or clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B) under the heading ""—The Guarantors,"" as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction; and (vii) any corporate reorganisations or other steps necessary or advisable to consummate or facilitate the Transactions. _Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_ If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Secured Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a ""Suspension Event""), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the ""Reversion Date""), the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture summarised under the following captions will not apply to the Senior Secured Notes: (1) ""—Limitation on Restricted Payments""; (2) ""—Limitation on Indebtedness""; (3) ""—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries""; (4) ""—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions""; (5) ""—Additional Notes Guarantees""; (6) ""—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock""; and (7)  the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ""—Merger and _Consolidation—The Senior Secured Notes Issuer""_ and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The ""Limitation on Restricted Payments"" covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under _""—Limitation on Indebtedness,"" as applicable. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will also_ permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honour any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Senior Secured Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Secured Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall notify the 327 ----- Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Senior Secured Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status. _Impairment of Security Interest_ The Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not, and in each case, shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that neither the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, nor any Forecourt Assets Separation, nor any repayment of intercompany receivables from time to time (including the Forecourt Disposal Receivable), nor any distribution or disposal of Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets, Substitute Retail Assets, Designated Bank Accounts or Post-Completion Disposal Receivables shall under any circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall not, and in each case, shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that: (i) the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged and released and retaken in accordance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent applicable in each case; (ii) the Security Documents may be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or replaced, from time to time to: (1) cure any ambiguity, mistake, omission, defect or inconsistency therein, (2) further secure the Senior Secured Notes (including Additional Senior Secured Notes), (3) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral to secure Additional Senior Secured Notes, (4) implement any Permitted Collateral Liens, (5) amend the Security Documents in accordance with the terms thereof, or (6) make any other change to any such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect; (iii) any Permitted Reorganisation may be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture; (iv) any corporate reorganisations or other steps necessary or advisable to consummate or facilitate the Transactions may be implemented; or (v) the Security Documents may otherwise be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released and retaken, or replaced where, contemporaneously with any such action, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer delivers to the Trustee: (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as applicable, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person confirming the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement. In the event that the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (as applicable) comply with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders. 328 ----- _Additional Notes Guarantees_ No Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor shall Guarantee (i) any Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor under any Syndicated Term Facilities, (ii) any Indebtedness of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Guarantor under any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination, or (iii) any Public Debt, unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor by no later than 10 Business Days after the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee; provided that: (a) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to provide a Notes Guarantee pursuant to this covenant as a result of Incurring a Guarantee under clause (2)(b) of the definition of ""Permitted Debt""; (b) no Restricted Subsidiary that is a member of the Regulated Group shall be required to provide a Notes Guarantee pursuant to this covenant; and (c) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be obligated to become a Guarantor pursuant to this covenant to the extent that, and for so long as, the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee would be inconsistent with the Agreed Security Principles or may reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings undertaken in connection with such Notes Guarantee. At the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on such Guarantor's liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognise certain defences generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under ""—Notes Guarantees."" A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer if, at the date of such release, there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Secured Notes Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in ""Risk Factors"" and ""Certain _Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests."" Financial Calculations_ When determining whether any transaction is permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall be permitted to test it, at its option, (i) on the date binding documentation for such transaction is entered into, (ii) on the date that any notice of any repayment, redemption, repurchase or refinancing of any Indebtedness is given to the holders thereof (if applicable), (iii) to the extent the nature or circumstances of a transaction make (i) or (ii) inapplicable, on the date that notice of such transaction is provided to the Holders in accordance with the provisions described in ""—Notices"" below or (iv) the date such transaction is consummated. If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer elects to test the transaction as described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the determination as to whether the transaction is permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture shall be made assuming that the transaction and other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith were consummated on the date binding documentation was entered into or such notice was given to the Trustee or the Holders (each, an ""Alternative Testing Date""), as applicable. If the transaction was permitted on the Alternative Testing Date chosen by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, it shall continue to be deemed so permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture even if it would have otherwise resulted in a Default or an Event of Default on 329 ----- the date it is consummated. When determining whether any transaction is permitted under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture as of the Alternative Testing Date, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will make all necessary calculations as set forth under the definition of ""Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio."" If the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has elected to test a transaction on an Alternative Testing Date (an ""Alternative Testing Date Election""), the transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on such date for the purposes of making any other determination under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, until such time (the ""Election Termination Time"") as (a) the transaction is definitively terminated, cancelled or abandoned, (b) the Senior Secured Notes Issuer has revoked its Alternative Testing Date Election and has instead opted to test the transaction on the date it is consummated, which the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be entitled to do, irrevocably and only once, at any time until the transaction is consummated, or (c) the transaction is consummated. From the time the Senior Secured Notes Issuer makes an Alternative Testing Date Election to the related Election Termination Time, the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will apply assuming that the relevant transaction was consummated on the Alternative Testing Date. No action properly taken by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries between an Alternative Testing Date Election and the related Election Termination Time will constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Indenture will permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honour any contractual commitments undertaken during such period of time, so long as they were not undertaken in anticipation of the Election Termination Time. _Topco Covenant_ Within 10 Business Days (or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter to the extent that consent or requirements of third parties are required to be obtained or satisfied) after all amounts due and payable under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility have been repaid in full or the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has otherwise been irrevocably satisfied and discharged, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer shall procure that Topco and its controlled Affiliates contribute to the equity of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, lend to the Senior Secured Notes Issuer as Subordinated Shareholder Funding or apply toward repayment of Post-Completion Disposal Receivables held by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries: (i) any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets owned by Topco or any such controlled Affiliates of Topco at such time, and (ii) an amount equal to any Net Available Cash received by Topco or any such controlled Affiliates of Topco from sale and leaseback transactions or other disposals in respect of such assets (including any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds) that have not been applied toward repayment or prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility (each such contribution, loan or repayment a ""Retail Assets Contribution""). For the avoidance of doubt, any failure by Topco or any of Topco's controlled Affiliates to make any required Retail Assets Contributions shall constitute a default of the Senior Secured Notes Issuer's obligation to procure such contributions. Neither Topco nor any of Topco's controlled Affiliates, other than the Senior Notes Issuer, the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, will become parties to, or otherwise be bound by, the terms of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture. In addition, neither the Senior Secured Notes Issuer nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries have the direct power to control the management or policies of Topco or any of its controlled Affiliates (other than the Senior Secured Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries).

A Default under clauses (4) or (6) of the preceding paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default unless the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture notify the Senior Secured Notes Issuer of the Default and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer fails to cure such Default within the time specified in clauses (4) or (6), as applicable, of the preceding paragraph, after receipt of such notice.

For the avoidance of doubt, the bankruptcy provisions will exclude the enforcement of Liens described in clause (31) of the definition of ""Permitted Liens,"" including by way of appointment of a receiver for such purpose. In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under ""Events of Default"" has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) has been remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default, or the Indebtedness that gave rise 331 ----- to such Event of Default has been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all other Events of Default outstanding, except non-payment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Secured Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Secured Notes, have been cured or waived.

Holders of the Senior Secured Notes may not enforce the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes except as provided in the Senior Secured Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Secured Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Senior Secured Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Secured Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Secured Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory 332 ----- to it against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Secured Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Secured Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders.

The Senior Secured Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Senior Secured Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

After an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder. The Senior Secured Notes Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give their written consent or take any other action. If a record date is fixed, then only those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give such consent (and revoke any consent previously given, if relevant) or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 180 days after such record date. For purposes of determining whether Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of the Senior Secured Notes have taken any action under this Senior Secured Notes Indenture, the aggregate principal amount of Senior Secured Notes will be deemed to be the Sterling Equivalent of the aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes as of (i) the record date in respect of such action (if a record date has been set with respect to the taking of such action), (ii) the date the taking of such action by Holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of such Senior Secured Notes has been certified to the Trustee by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, or (iii) as of a date selected by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer that is within the consent delivery period or no more than five Business Days prior to the beginning of the consent delivery period, as specified by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer in the relevant consent materials. 335 ----- In formulating their decisions on matters set forth in this Section ""Amendments and Waivers,"" the Trustee and the Security Agent shall be entitled to require and rely absolutely on such evidence as they deems necessary, including Officer's Certificates and Opinions of Counsel.

Please see ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor _Agreement"" for a description of the material terms of the Intercreditor Agreement._ The registered Holder of a Senior Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders will have rights under the Senior Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, with respect to enforcement and the pursuit of other remedies. The Senior Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act and are subject to certain transfer restrictions. This ""Description of the Senior Notes"" is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Security Documents. Since this description of the terms of the Senior Notes is only a summary, you should refer to the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture and the Security Documents for complete descriptions of the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and your rights. Copies of such documents are available from us upon request, and following the Issue Date, copies of such documents will be made available upon request to holders of Senior Notes, as described in more detail under ""Listing and General Information.""",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.2,Acquisition Agreement; Timing of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds,61.2.1,,"Pursuant to the acquisition agreement dated October 2, 2020 (the ""Acquisition Agreement"") between Bellis Acquisition Company 3 Limited, an indirect subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer formed for the purpose of facilitating the Transactions (the ""Purchaser""), and ASDA Holdings UK Limited, the Purchaser agreed to acquire all of the issued ordinary shares of the Company. We intend to settle the Offering on          , 2021 (the ""Issue Date""), which we currently expect to be after the date of consummation of the Acquisition (the ""Completion Date""). In this case, on the Completion Date, the Issuers are expected to draw £700 million (equivalent) in loans under the Senior Bridge Facility and £1,400 million (equivalent) in loans under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement. On the Issue Date, we will then use 379 ----- the proceeds of the offering of the Senior Notes together with the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Secured Notes to repay all amounts outstanding under the Senior Bridge Facility and the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities. See ""Use of Proceeds."" In this case, on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer and will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, the Company and ASDA Stores Limited (the ""Initial Guarantors""). It is, however, possible that the Completion Date may be delayed until after the Issue Date, including due to the timing of our receipt of the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. In this case, unless the Offering is completed substantially concurrently with the Completion Date, we will fund the gross proceeds of the Offering into escrow, as further described below and, on the Issue Date, the Senior Notes will be obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer only and will not be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by the Initial Guarantors until the Completion Date. In such circumstances, the Company and its Subsidiaries will continue to be controlled by Walmart prior the Completion Date. We cannot assure you that Walmart will operate ASDA's business during the interim period in the same way that the Senior Notes Issuer would and we cannot assure you that, following the Completion Date, the Company will operate its business in the same way that Walmart has operated the business in the past. As such, we cannot assure you that, prior to the Completion Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries will not engage in activities that would otherwise have been prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture, had those covenants been applicable to such entities after the Issue Date and prior to the Completion Date. If this Offering is settled substantially concurrently with the Acquisition, we will forego the escrow procedures described above and will instead retain the proceeds of the Offering to fund part of the consideration payable under the Acquisition Agreement on the Completion Date. See ""Use of Proceeds."" In any event, as contemplated by the Acquisition Agreement, the Acquisition will be completed during the pendency of the review of the Acquisition by the CMA, and the CMA's review remains ongoing. In connection with its review of the Acquisition, the CMA is expected to issue an IEO, which we expect to remain in force until the CMA Clearance Date. Under this IEO, neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any Parent will be permitted to exercise control over the Company and its Subsidiaries or otherwise direct their operations until the CMA Clearance Date. Accordingly, the Senior Notes Issuer and its Parents will not be able to direct the Company and its Subsidiaries to comply with the covenants described in this ""Description _of the Senior Notes"" until the CMA Clearance Date, and the Company and its material subsidiaries will_ have no contractual obligation to comply with these covenants until each of these entities accedes to Senior Notes Indenture on the applicable date, which will be on or after the Completion Date. Nevertheless, the covenants described herein will apply to the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries from the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date, and any failure to comply with these covenants will constitute a Default under the Senior Notes Indenture. _Escrow of Proceeds; Special Mandatory Redemption_ If the Offering is consummated prior to, and not substantially concurrently with or after, the Completion Date, the Initial Purchasers will deposit, on the Issue Date, an amount in cash equal to the gross proceeds of this offering and sale of the Senior Notes on the Issue Date into one or more escrow accounts (such proceeds, the ""Escrowed Proceeds"" and such accounts, collectively, the ""Escrow Accounts"") pursuant to the terms of one or more escrow agreements (each an ""Escrow Agreement"" and together, the ""Escrow",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The Senior Notes Issuer's rights with respect to the Escrow Accounts, together with the Escrowed Property, will be pledged in favour of the Trustee on behalf of, and for the benefit of, the Holders of Senior Notes on the Issue Date (such charges to be documented under one or more English law governed security agreements (the ""Escrow Account Charges"") among the Senior Notes Issuer and the Trustee to be dated on or before the Issue Date). Under the terms of the Escrow Agreements, amounts may be released from the Escrow Accounts prior to the Completion Date to pay accrued interest on the Senior Notes on any interest payment date in respect thereof occurring prior to the Escrow Release Date. Each Holder, by accepting a Senior Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to and accepted the terms and conditions of the applicable Escrow Agreement or Escrow Agreements, as applicable, and the Escrow Account Charges and to have irrevocably authorised and directed the Trustee and the Escrow Agent to take all actions set forth in the Escrow Agreements in the event it is executed without the need for further 380 ----- direction from them under the Senior Notes Indenture. Changes or other modifications to the Escrow Agreements and the Escrow Account Charges can be made either with the consent of Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the applicable series of Senior Notes then outstanding or without the consent of Holders, if such changes or other modifications will not, individually or when taken as whole, adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect. _Release of Escrowed Proceeds in connection with the consummation of Acquisition_ In order to cause the Escrow Agent to release the Escrowed Property to, or to pay it at the instruction of, the Senior Notes Issuer (the ""Release""), the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall have received from the Senior Notes Issuer, at a time that is on or before April 30, 2022 (the ""Outside Date""), an Officer's Certificate pursuant to each Escrow Agreement, upon which both the Escrow Agent and the Trustee shall conclusively rely, without further investigation or verification, certifying that (i) as of the date of delivery of such Officer's Certificate, there is no Event of Default under clause (5) of the first paragraph under the heading titled ""Events of Default"" with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer, and (ii) the Acquisition has been consummated or will be consummated reasonably promptly, and in no event later than three Business Days, following the Release, in accordance with the terms of the Acquisition Agreement as in effect on the date of this Offering Memorandum, except for any changes or other modifications to such terms to which the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes then outstanding have consented or that will not, individually or when taken as whole, have a materially adverse effect on the Holders. Under the terms of each Escrow Agreement, the Release shall occur promptly upon the satisfaction of the conditions set forth above (the date of such satisfaction, the ""Escrow Release Date""). Upon any such Release, the balance of the Escrow Accounts shall be reduced to zero, and the Escrowed Property shall be released in accordance with each Escrow Agreement. Receipt by the Trustee of such Officer's Certificate shall constitute deemed consent by the Trustee to the release of the Escrowed Property from the charges documented under the Escrow Account Charges. _Special Mandatory Redemption_ Pursuant to one or more shortfall agreements (the ""Shortfall Agreements"") to be entered into on or prior to the Issue Date between the Issuers and Bellis Midco Limited (""Midco""), a wholly owned subsidiary of Topco and a Holding Company of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, Midco will be required to contribute to the Escrow Accounts and the corresponding escrow accounts for the Senior Secured Notes, up to the maximum aggregate amount of £20.0 million, an amount in cash expected to equal the sum of (i) interest accrued on the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes from the Issue Date, and (ii) any Additional Amounts or corresponding additional amounts for the Senior Secured Notes, in each case, to March 31, 2021 (the ""Shortfall Agreement Termination Date""), which is the date by which we expect to have received the FCA's approval of the Acquisition. A bank of international standing (the ""Issuing Bank"") will guarantee Midco's obligations under the Shortfall Agreements by delivering to the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer, on the Issue Date, an irrevocable letter of credit or on demand guarantee (the ""On-Demand Guarantee"") expiring on March 31, 2021. Pursuant to the On-Demand Guarantee, each of the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer will be entitled to draw funds from the Issuing Bank to make up the relevant escrow shortfall, upon request made no later than March 31, 2021 and up to the maximum aggregate amount of £20.0 million. If the Acquisition and the Release have not occurred by March 31, 2021, Midco shall be entitled to extend the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date unilaterally, at its discretion, by procuring that all of the following actions take place: (a) Midco shall have increased its commitment to contribute cash to the Escrow Accounts and the corresponding escrow accounts for the Senior Secured Notes under the Shortfall Agreements to an amount expected to equal the sum of (i) interest accrued on the Senior Notes and the Senior Secured Notes from April 1, 2021, and (ii) any Additional Amounts or corresponding additional amounts for the Senior Secured Notes, in each case, to a date chosen by Midco that is not later than the Outside Date, (b) the Issuing Bank shall have increased its original commitment under the On-Demand Guarantee by the same amount set forth in clause (a), and (c) the expiry date of the On-Demand Guarantee shall have been extended to, and be the same as, the extended Shortfall Termination Date. The Senior Notes Issuer will promptly deliver notice of any extension of the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date to the Trustee and the Escrow Agent, confirming that all actions described in the preceding clauses (a), (b) and (c) have been completed. Midco may decide to extend the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date on one or more occasions, at its discretion, up to (but no later than) the Outside Date under the Escrow Agreement.

In the event that (a) the Escrow Release Date does not take place on or prior to the Outside Date, (b) in the reasonable judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer, the Acquisition will not be consummated by the Outside Date, (c) the Acquisition Agreement terminates at any time on or prior to the Outside Date, (d) an 381 ----- Event of Default arises under clause (5) of the first paragraph under ""—Events of Default"" on or prior to the Outside Date with respect to the Senior Notes Issuer, or (e) the Shortfall Agreement Termination Date occurs on or prior to the Outside Date and at a time when the Escrow Release Date has not yet taken place (the date of any such event being the ""Special Termination Date""), the Senior Notes Issuer will redeem all of the Senior Notes (the ""Special Mandatory Redemption"") at a price equal to 100% of their respective aggregate issue price, plus accrued but unpaid interest from the Issue Date to the Special Mandatory Redemption Date (as defined below) (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and Additional Amounts, if any (the ""Special Mandatory Redemption Price"").

The ability to take enforcement 383 ----- action against any Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement, and potentially any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into after the Issue Date. In addition, the Notes Guarantees and the Collateral are subject to release under certain circumstances, including, but not limited to, certain enforcement actions taken by the Security Agent acting at the direction of an instructing group of senior secured creditors. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, it is likely that holders of Senior Indebtedness of a Guarantor would recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Senior Notes in any insolvency proceeding relating to such entity. In any such case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of, or interest on, the Senior Notes after the repayment in full of all Senior Indebtedness.

However, under the circumstances described below under _""—Certain Definitions— _Unrestricted Subsidiary,"" we will be permitted to designate certain of our Subsidiaries as ""Unrestricted_ Subsidiaries."" Our Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive covenants in the Senior Notes Indenture. On the Completion Date, entities within the ASDA Group entered into the ASDA Leases and granted first-ranking mortgages, fixed charges or standard securities, as applicable, over certain Warehouse Assets and Select Retail Assets and, to the extent required by the terms of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility, certain Substitute Retail Assets, as well as first-ranking pledges over the Designated Bank Accounts, in each case, to secure the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility Borrower's obligations under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility. None of the lenders or the other secured parties under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, the Senior Bridge Facility, the Senior Credit Facilities or the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility benefit from any security interest in the Warehouse Assets, the Select Retail Assets, the Substitute Retail Assets or the Designated Bank Accounts, and these assets will not be pledged as collateral for the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes.

See ""—Certain Covenants—Limitation on _Indebtedness"" and ""—Certain Definitions—Indebtedness."" In addition, as described below under ""—Certain Covenants—Additional Notes Guarantees"" and subject to the Intercreditor Agreement and the Agreed Security Principles, each Restricted Subsidiary that guarantees any Indebtedness Incurred under any Syndicated Term Facilities, any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination or any Public Debt shall also enter into a supplemental indenture as a Guarantor of the Senior Notes. The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of guarantees and security in favour of obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Notes and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of guarantees where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference rules, ""thin capitalisation"" rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, where the time and cost of granting the guarantee or security would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders or where security would be granted over the Capital Stock, liabilities, property or other assets of any member of the Regulated Group. Each Notes Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that would not render the Guarantor's obligations subject to avoidance under applicable fraudulent conveyance provisions of the United States Bankruptcy Code or any comparable provision of foreign or state law, or as otherwise stipulated under the Agreed Security Principles, including to comply with corporate benefit, financial assistance and other laws. By virtue of this limitation, a Guarantor's obligation under its Notes Guarantee could be significantly less 386 ----- than amounts payable with respect to the Senior Notes, or a Guarantor may have effectively no obligation under its Notes Guarantee.

Any Book-Entry Interest that is transferred as described in the immediately preceding paragraphs will, upon transfer, cease to be a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Note from which it was transferred and will become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Senior Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry Interests in the Global Senior Note to which it was transferred. If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of £100,000 principal amount and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof upon receipt by the Registrar of instructions relating thereto and any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Senior Notes Indenture.

In addition, pursuant to the Intercreditor Agreement or Additional_ Intercreditor Agreements (if any) entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See ""—Release of Liens,"" ""—Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest"" and ""—Certain Definitions—Permitted Collateral Liens."" _Enforcement of Security Interests_ The Intercreditor Agreement will restrict the ability of the Trustee or the Holders of Senior Notes to enforce the Security Interests and will provide for the release of the Security Interests created by the Security Documents in certain circumstances upon enforcement by the Security Agent in accordance with the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. These limitations are described under ""Description of Certain _Financing Arrangements — Intercreditor Agreement"" and ""Certain Insolvency Considerations and Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests."" The ability_ to enforce the Security Interests may also be restricted by similar arrangements in relation to future Indebtedness that is secured on the Collateral in compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor Agreement will provide (and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will provide) for circumstances in which the Holders of the Senior Notes may instruct the Security Agent to take enforcement action in respect of such Security Interests including if, among other things, a default under the Senior Notes is continuing following the expiry of a Senior Notes enforcement standstill period (being a period of up to 179 days), provided that (other than in the case of an event of default which has occurred under the Senior Notes as a result of failure to pay principal at final maturity) no such enforcement action may be taken against a debtor or any of its subsidiaries if enforcement action is being taken by the Security Agent against that debtor in respect of Shared Security on the instructions of an instructing group which the proposed Senior Notes enforcement action might reasonably be expected to adversely affect. The restrictions under the Intercreditor Agreement do not restrict the right of the Topco Notes Creditors (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement) to institute suit against the Senior Notes Issuer for the recovery of any payment due by the Senior Notes Issuer in respect of the Senior Notes. _Agreed Security Principles_ The Agreed Security Principles apply to the granting of Notes Guarantees and security in favour of obligations under the Senior Notes and are substantially similar to the agreed security principles appended to the Senior Facilities Agreement. The Agreed Security Principles include restrictions on the granting of Notes Guarantees and security where, among other things, such grant would be restricted by general statutory or other legal limitations or requirements, financial assistance rules, corporate benefit rules, fraudulent preference rules, ""thin capitalisation"" rules, capital maintenance rules, retention of title claims and similar matters, where the time and cost of granting the guarantee or security would be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Holders or where security would be granted over the Capital Stock, property or other assets, or liabilities of a member of the Regulated Group. In this ""Agreed Security Principles"" section only, any reference to ""Acquired Person or Asset,"" ""Agent,"" ""Debtor,"" ""Finance Document,"" ""Secured Debt Document,"" or ""Secured Parties"" is a reference to that term as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement as in effect on the Issue Date. See ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement."" General Principles The guarantees and security required to be provided under the Secured Debt Documents will be given in accordance with the security principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles. The description that follows identifies the Agreed Security Principles and addresses the manner in which the Agreed Security Principles will impact on and determine the extent and terms of the guarantees, including the Notes 390 ----- Guarantees, and security proposed to be provided under or pursuant to any Secured Debt Document, including the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes and the Security Documents. (a) The Agreed Security Principles embody the recognition by all parties that there may be certain legal and practical difficulties in obtaining effective or commercially reasonable Notes Guarantees and/or security from all relevant members of the Group in each jurisdiction in which it has been agreed that Notes Guarantees and security will be granted by those members. In particular: (i) general legal and statutory limitations, regulatory restrictions, financial assistance, anti-trust and other competition authority restrictions, corporate benefit, fraudulent preference, equitable subordination, ""transfer pricing,"" ""thin capitalisation,"" ""earnings stripping,"" ""controlled foreign corporation"" and other tax restrictions, ""exchange control restrictions,"" ""capital maintenance"" rules and ""liquidity impairment"" rules, tax restrictions, retention of title claims, employee consultation or approval requirements and similar principles may limit the ability of a member of the Group to provide a Notes Guarantee or security or may require that the Notes Guarantee or security be limited as to amount or otherwise and, if so, the Notes Guarantee or security will be limited accordingly, _provided_ that to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable security or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such Notes Guarantee or Security Document shall be subject to such limit; (ii) a key factor in determining whether or not a Notes Guarantee or security will be taken (and in respect of the security, the extent of its perfection and/or registration) is the applicable time and cost (including adverse effects on taxes, interest deductibility, stamp duty, registration taxes, notarial costs and all applicable legal fees) which will not be disproportionate to the benefit accruing to the Secured Parties of obtaining such Notes Guarantee or security; (iii) members of the Group will not be required to give Notes Guarantees or enter into Security Documents if they are not wholly owned by another member of the Group or if it is not within the legal capacity of the relevant members of the Group or if it would conflict with the fiduciary or statutory duties of their directors or contravene any applicable legal, regulatory or contractual prohibition or restriction or have the potential to result in a material risk of personal or criminal liability for any director or officer of or for any member of the Group, provided that, to the extent requested by the Security Agent before signing any applicable Security Document or accession document, the relevant member of the Group shall use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to overcome any such obstacle or otherwise such Notes Guarantee or Security Document shall be subject to such limit; (iv) Notes Guarantees and security will be limited so that the aggregate of notarial costs and all registration and like taxes and duties relating to the provision of security will not exceed an amount to be agreed between the grantor of the security and the Security Agent; (v) where a class of assets to be secured includes material and immaterial assets, if the cost of granting security over the immaterial assets is disproportionate to the benefit of such security, security will be granted over the material assets only; (vi) it is expressly acknowledged that it may be either impossible or impractical to create security over certain categories of assets in which event security will not be taken over such assets; (vii) any asset subject to a legal requirement, contract, lease, licence, instrument, regulatory constraint (including any agreement with any government or regulatory body) or other third party arrangement, which may prevent or condition the asset from being charged, secured or being subject to the applicable Security Document (including requiring a consent of any third party, supervisory board or works council (or equivalent)) and any asset which, if subject to the applicable Security Document, would give a third party the right to terminate or otherwise amend any rights, benefits and/or obligations with respect to any member of the Group in 391 ----- respect of the asset or require the relevant chargor to take any action materially adverse to the interests of the Group or any member thereof, in each case will be excluded from a Notes Guarantee or Security Document, provided that, reasonable endeavours (exercised for a specified period of time and without incurring material cost or instigating legal proceedings) to obtain consent to charging any asset (where otherwise prohibited) shall be used by the Group if the Security Agent specifies prior to the date of the security or accession document that the asset is material and the Senior Notes Issuer is satisfied that such endeavours will not involve placing relationships with third parties in jeopardy; (viii) the giving of a Notes Guarantee, the granting of security and the registration and/or the perfection of the security granted will not be required if it would have a material adverse effect on the ability of the relevant member of the Group to conduct its operations and business in the ordinary course as otherwise permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture (including dealing with the secured assets and all contractual counterparties or amending, waiving or terminating (or allowing to lapse) any rights, benefits or obligations, in each case prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing), and any requirement under the Agreed Security Principles to seek consent of any person or take or not take any other action shall be subject to this clause (viii); (ix) any Security Document will only be required to be notarised if required by law in order for the relevant security to become effective or admissible in evidence; (x) no Notes Guarantee or security will be required to be given by or over any Acquired Person or Asset (and no consent shall be required to be sought with respect thereto) which are required to support acquired indebtedness to the extent such acquired indebtedness is permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture to remain outstanding after an acquisition. No member of a target group or other entity acquired pursuant to an acquisition not prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture shall be required to become a guarantor or grant security with respect to any Secured Debt Document if prevented by the terms of the documentation governing that acquired indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness or any Refinancing Indebtedness) or if becoming a Guarantor or the granting of any security would give rise to an obligation (including any payment obligation) under or in relation thereto; no security will be granted over any asset secured for the benefit of any permitted Indebtedness and/or to the extent constituting a Permitted Lien unless specifically required by the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement; (xi) to the extent possible and unless required by applicable law, there should be no action required to be taken in relation to the Notes Guarantee or the Collateral when any Holder assigns or transfers any of its Senior Notes to a new Holder (and, unless explicitly agreed to the contrary in the Senior Notes Indenture or any Security Document, no member of the Group shall bear or otherwise be liable for any taxes, any notarial, registration or perfection fees or any other costs, fees or expenses that result from any assignment or transfer by a Holder); (xii) (other than the Real Estate Reports) no title investigations or other diligence on assets will be required and no title insurance will be required and any security shall take subject to any matters registered against the title to the assets as at the date of the relevant security or to which the security is otherwise legally subject; (xiii) security will not be required over any assets subject to security in favour of a third party (other than in relation to security under general business conditions of account banks which do not prohibit or prevent the creation of Security Interests over such accounts) or any cash constituting regulatory capital or customer cash (and such assets or cash shall be excluded from any relevant Security Document); (xiv) to the extent legally effective, all security will be given in favour of the Security Agent and not the Secured Parties individually (with the Security Agent to hold one set of Security Documents for all the Secured Parties); ""parallel debt"" provisions will be used where necessary (and included in the Intercreditor Agreement and not the individual Security Documents); no member of the Group will be required to take any action in relation to any Notes Guarantees or security as a result of any assignment or transfer by a Secured Party; 392 ----- (xv) Notes Guarantees and security will not be required from or over the assets of, any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly-owned by another member of the Group; (xvi) each Security Document shall be deemed not to restrict or condition any transaction not prohibited under the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and the security granted under each Security Document entered into after the Completion Date shall be deemed to be subject to these Agreed Security Principles, before and after the execution of the relevant Security Document and creation of the relevant security; (xvii) no security may be provided on terms which are inconsistent with the turnover or sharing provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement; (xviii) the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will not be able to exercise any power of attorney or set-off granted to them under the terms of the Secured Debt Documents prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing; (xix) no Notes Guarantee or security shall guarantee or secure any ""Excluded Swap Obligations"" defined in accordance with the LSTA Market Advisory Update dated February 15, 2013 entitled ""Swap Regulations' Implications for Loan Documentation,"" and any update thereto by the LSTA; (xx) other than a general security agreement and related filing, no perfection, filing or other action will be required with respect to assets of a type not owned by members of the Group; and (xxi) no translation of any document relating to any security or any asset subject to any security will be required to be prepared or provided to the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time), unless (i) required for such documents to become effective or admissible in evidence and (ii) an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing. (b) Notwithstanding any term of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document, no Senior Note, Notes Guarantee or other obligation under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Security Document may be, directly or indirectly: (i) guaranteed by a ""controlled foreign corporation"" (as defined in Section 957(a) of the Internal Revenue Code) that is owned by a member of the Group that is a US Person (such entity owned by a member of the Group that is a US Person, a ""CFC"") or by an entity (a ""FSHCO"") substantially all the assets of which consist of equity interests (or equity interests and indebtedness) of one or more CFCs, or guaranteed by a subsidiary of a CFC or FSHCO; (ii) secured by any assets of a CFC, FSHCO or a subsidiary of a CFC or a FSHCO (including any CFC or FSHCO equity interests held directly or indirectly by a CFC or FSHCO); (iii) secured by a pledge or other security interest in excess of 65% of the voting equity interests (and 100% of the non-voting equity interests) of a CFC or FSHCO; or (iv) guaranteed by any subsidiary or secured by a pledge of or security interest in any subsidiary or other asset, if it would result in material adverse US tax consequences as reasonably determined by the grantor of the security or Guarantor (as applicable) and the Trustee or any other Agent. Guarantees Subject to the guarantee limitations set out in the Senior Notes Indenture, each Notes Guarantee will be an upstream, cross-stream and downstream guarantee for all liabilities of the Debtors under the Secured Debt Documents in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of the Agreed Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction (references to ""security"" to be read for this purpose as including the Notes Guarantees and guarantees provided pursuant to any other Finance Document). Security documents will secure the guarantee obligations of the relevant security provider or, if such security is provided on a third 393 ----- party basis, all liabilities of the Debtors under the Secured Debt Documents, in each case in accordance with, and subject to, the requirements of these Agreed Security Principles in each relevant jurisdiction. Governing law and scope of security (a) No security or Notes Guarantees shall be required to be given by (or shares or investments in) any joint venture or similar arrangement, any minority interest or any member of the Group that is not wholly owned by another member of the Group. (b) The parties agree that the overriding intention, subject to clause (a) above, is for security only to be granted by and shall be limited to: (i) Holdco, on a limited recourse third party basis, in respect of the shares it holds in the Senior Notes Issuer and all intercompany loans owed to it by the Senior Notes Issuer; (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer, on a first priority basis, in respect of the assets described in (i)(c) of the first paragraph under the caption ""—Security—General""; and (iii) the Senior Notes Issuer, on a second priority basis, in respect of the assets described in (ii) of the first paragraph under the caption ""—Security—General,"" and that no other security shall be required to be given by any other member of the Group or in relation to any other asset unless specifically requested or agreed to by the Senior Notes Issuer (in its absolute discretion) (together, the ""Overriding Principle""). (c) All security (other than share security) will be governed by the law of, and secure only assets located in, the jurisdiction of incorporation of the applicable grantor of the security and no action in relation to security (including any perfection step, further assurance step, filing or registration) will be required in jurisdictions where the grantor of the security is not incorporated. Share security over any subsidiary will be governed by the law of the place of incorporation of that subsidiary. Any security over a structural intercompany loan granted to the Senior Notes Issuer will be governed by the governing law of such structural intra-group loan document. (d) Notwithstanding any other terms of the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement, no security or Notes Guarantees shall be required to be granted by any member of the Group that is not incorporated in the United Kingdom, any jurisdiction of incorporation of a Material Subsidiary and any jurisdiction of incorporation of a borrower under the Senior Facilities Agreement (each of the foregoing, a ""Security Jurisdiction""), other than security over shares in a Material Subsidiary granted by a member of the Group that is not incorporated in a Security Jurisdiction. Terms of security documents The following principles will be reflected in the terms of any Security Documents: (a) security will not be enforceable or crystallise until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing; (b) the Secured Parties (or any agent or similar representative appointed by them at the relevant time) will only be able to exercise a power of attorney following the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing; (c) the Security Documents should only operate to create security rather than to impose new commercial obligations or repeat clauses in other Secured Debt Documents and accordingly: (i) they should not contain additional representations, undertakings or indemnities (including, without limitation, in respect of insurance, information, maintenance or protection of assets or the payment of fees, costs and expenses) unless these are the same as or consistent with those contained in the other Secured Debt Documents and are required for the creation or perfection of security; and (ii) nothing in any Security Document shall operate or be construed so as to prohibit any transaction, matter or other step (or a grantor of security taking or entering into the same) or dealing in any manner whatsoever in relation to any asset (including all rights, claims, benefits, proceeds and documentation, and 394 ----- Bank accounts contractual counterparties in relation thereto) the subject of (or expressed to be the subject of) the security agreement if not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement (and accordingly to such extent, the Security Agent shall promptly effect releases, confirmations, consents to deal or similar steps always at the cost of the relevant grantor of the security); (d) no security will be granted over parts, stock, moveable plant, equipment or receivables if it would require labelling, segregation or periodic listing or specification of such parts, stock, moveable plant, equipment or receivables; (e) perfection will not be required in respect of (i) vehicles and other assets subject to certificates of title or (ii) letter of credit rights and tort claims (or the local law equivalent); (f) in no event shall control agreements (or perfection by control or similar arrangements) be required with respect to any assets (including deposit or securities accounts) (unless the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement expressly provide for any specific account (by reference to its purpose) to be subject to specific restrictions on use); (g) security will, where possible and practical, automatically create security over future assets of the same type as those already secured; where local law requires supplemental pledges or notices to be delivered in respect of future acquired assets in order for effective security to be created over that class of asset, such supplemental pledges or notices will be provided only upon request of the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Trustee or another Agent) and at intervals no more frequent than annually (unless required more frequently under local law); and (h) each Security Document must contain a clause which records that if there is a conflict between the Security Document and the Finance Documents or the Intercreditor Agreement then (to the fullest extent permitted by law) the provisions of the Finance Documents or (as applicable) the Intercreditor Agreement will take priority over the provisions of the Security Document. (a) If a member of the Group grants security over its material bank accounts it will be free to deal, operate and transact business in relation to those accounts (including opening and closing accounts) until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing (unless the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents expressly provide for any specific account (by reference to its purpose) to be subject to specific restrictions on use). For the avoidance of doubt, (unless the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents expressly provide for any specific account (by reference to its purpose) to be subject to specific restrictions on use) there will be no ""fixed"" security over bank accounts, cash or receivables or any obligation to hold or pay cash or receivables in a particular account unless the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Notes have become immediately due and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. (b) Where ""fixed"" security is required in accordance with paragraph (a) above, if required by local law to perfect the security and it is possible to give such notice of security without disrupting the operation of the account(s) in question, notice of the security will be served on the account bank in relation to applicable accounts within 10 Business Days of the date of the Security Document (or accession thereto) and the applicable grantor of the security will use its reasonable endeavours to obtain an acknowledgement of that notice within 20 Business Days of service. If the grantor of the security has used its reasonable endeavours but has not been able to obtain acknowledgement or acceptance, its obligation to obtain acknowledgement will cease on the expiry of that 20 Business Day period. Irrespective of whether notice of the security is required for perfection, if the service of notice would prevent any member of the Group from using a bank account in the course of its business, no notice of security will be served unless the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Notes have become immediately due and payable as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. (c) Any security over bank accounts will be subject to any security interests in favour of the account bank which are created either by law or in the standard terms and conditions 395 ----- Real Property of the account bank. No grantor of security will be required to change its banking arrangements or standard terms and conditions in connection with the granting of bank account security. (d) If required under applicable local law, security over bank accounts will be registered subject to the general principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles.

There shall be no requirement to grant security over real property not located in the United Kingdom. (b) There shall be no restrictions in any Security Document restricting members of the Group from transferring, leasing or otherwise disposing of real estate assets to other members of the Group (other than, in respect of Material Real Property which is required to comprise part of the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture, security granted to other members of the Group, which shall be restricted in the manner contemplated by the Senior Notes Indenture) or any third parties and, for the avoidance of doubt, no consent or approval shall be required under any Security Document from the Trustee or the Holders for any such transfers, leases or dispositions and the Security Agent shall be authorised to release any security over any real estate assets and provide such consent, approval or certificate that may be requested by any member of the Group in relation to such transfers, leases or dispositions without the need for any further consent or approval from the Trustee or the Holders to the extent the relevant transfer, lease or disposition is not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. (c) Where granting security over any real property would require obtaining consent from a third party, there shall be no requirement to grant security (including floating security to the extent such consent is required) over any such real property if such consent is not obtained. (d) Where granting security over any real property would require complying with or satisfying a restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of a third party, the relevant member of the Group shall, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture, use reasonable endeavours (but without incurring material cost, instigating legal proceedings and without adverse impact on relationships with third parties) to comply with or satisfy such restriction, inhibition or arrangement following which, if the restriction, inhibition or arrangement in favour of the third party cannot be satisfied or complied with or the third party has not provided any consent, approval, certificate or other documentation required to register that security at HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), there shall be no requirement to grant security. (e) Where granting security over any real property would require complying with or satisfying a restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) in favour of or for the benefit of a third party that requires the Security Agent to enter into any document pursuant to that restriction, inhibition or arrangement (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), if the Security Agent declines to enter into such document or requests modifications to the form of any such document (it being understood that the Security Agent is not obliged to enter into any such documentation that is not agreed with it and the Security Agent shall not be liable to any party for requesting modifications to the form of any such document or declining to enter into such document (acting reasonably)), there shall be no requirement to enter into negotiations regarding that document or to grant security over that real property. (f) Notwithstanding that a restriction, inhibition or arrangement has been satisfied or complied with in accordance with paragraph (d) above, if a third party has not provided any documentation or information required for dealing with any requisition raised by HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) that results in an application being cancelled, then no security shall be granted over that real property. 396 ----- (g) In relation to the Material Real Properties, where there is existing security registered on the title at HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), there shall be no requirement to apply for the removal of such registration unless such security was granted in respect of financing obtained from another member of the Group, ASDA Holdings UK Limited (the ""Vendor"") or any Affiliate of the Vendor or a financial institution, credit institution, insurance broker or pension fund in their capacity as lenders. (h) Where the Security Agent has the benefit of a restriction or inhibition (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent) on the title of a property, it shall provide its consent, approval, certificate or release in the form required by HM Land Registry (or the relevant jurisdictional equivalent), to allow any matter that is not prohibited under the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement as soon as possible and in any event within 10 Business Days of request by the Senior Notes Issuer accompanied by a certification by the Senior Notes Issuer that such matter is not prohibited under the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement. (i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no security shall be required to be granted over, or in respect of, any Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets. Fixed assets Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if a member of the Group grants security over its material fixed assets it will be free to deal with those assets in the course of its business until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. No notice, whether to third parties or by attaching a notice to the fixed assets, will be prepared or given until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. Insurance policies (a) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, a member of the Group may grant security over its material insurance policies (excluding any third party liability or public liability insurance and any directors and officers insurance in respect of which claims thereunder may be mandatorily prepaid, provided that the relevant insurance policy allows security to be so granted). Notice of any security interest over insurance policies will only be served on an insurer of the Group assets upon written request of the Security Agent (acting on the instructions of the Trustee or another Agent), which may only be given after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. (b) Prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing, no loss payee or other endorsement will be made on the insurance policy and no Secured Party will be named as co-insured. Intellectual property (a) No security will be granted over any intellectual property which cannot be secured under the terms of the relevant licencing agreement. (b) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if security is granted over the relevant material intellectual property, the grantor shall be free to deal with, use, licence and otherwise commercialise those assets in the course of its business (including allowing its intellectual property to lapse if no longer material to its business) until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. (c) Notice of any security interest over intellectual property will only be served on a third party from whom intellectual property is licensed upon written request of the Security Agent, which may only be given after the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. No intellectual property security will be required to be registered under the law of that Security Document, the law where the grantor is regulated, or at any relevant supranational registry. Security over intellectual property rights will be taken on an ""as is, where is"" basis and the Group will not be required to procure any changes to, or corrections of filings on, external registers. Receivables (a) Without prejudice to the Overriding Principle, if the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor grants security over any of its receivables it will be free to deal with, amend, waive or terminate those receivables in the course of its business until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing. No notice of security may be prepared or served until the occurrence of an Event of Default which is continuing (other than security over 397 ----- Shares structural intra-group loans). Any list of receivables provided will not include details of the underlying contracts (but may include non-sensitive generic information to the extent that would allow for the creation of security) and will not be required to be updated after the delivery of the first list by any Material Subsidiary. If required under local law, security over receivables will be registered subject to the general principles set out in these Agreed Security Principles. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no security shall be required to be granted over, or in respect of, any Post-Completion Disposal Receivables. (a) Security over shares, stocks or partnership interests will be limited to those over the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Secured Notes Issuer. (b) Until an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the legal title of the shares will remain with the relevant grantor of the security (unless transfer of title on granting such security is customary in the applicable jurisdiction) and any grantor of share security shall be permitted to retain and to exercise voting rights and powers in relation to any shares and other related rights charged by it and receive, own and retain all assets and proceeds in relation thereto without restriction or condition, provided that any exercise of rights does not materially adversely affect the validity or enforceability of the Security Interest over the shares or cause an Event of Default to occur. (c) Where customary and applicable as a matter of law, on, or as soon as reasonably practicable and after execution (and taking into account any stamping requirements in respect of any stock transfer form (or applicable law equivalent)) of that security or accession document, the applicable share certificate (or other documents evidencing title to the relevant shares) and a stock transfer form executed in blank (or applicable law equivalent) will be provided to the Security Agent.

The Security Documents will be entered into among, inter alios, the relevant security provider and the Security Agent as agent for the secured parties. The Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, to the extent permitted by the applicable laws, only the Security Agent will have the right to enforce the Security Documents on behalf of the Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes. The Security Documents will provide that the rights under the Security Documents and the Senior Notes Indenture must be exercised by the Security Agent. As a consequence of such contractual provisions, holders of the Senior Notes will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the Collateral securing the Senior Notes except through the Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement) provide instructions to the Security Agent for the Collateral.

If such redemption is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Senior Notes Issuer's discretion, the redemption date may be delayed or extended until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied or waived, or such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed, in each case, as so notified by the Senior Notes Issuer to the Holders; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture. In addition, the Senior Notes Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Senior Notes Issuer's obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person, and such notice of redemption may be extended if such conditions precedent have not been satisfied or waived by the Senior Notes Issuer by notice to the Holders; provided that in no case shall the notice have been delivered less than 10 or more than 60 days prior to the date on which such redemption (if any) occurs except that redemption notices may be delivered more than 60 days prior to a redemption date if the notice is issued in connection with a defeasance of the Senior Notes or a satisfaction and discharge of the Senior Notes Indenture. If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related interest payment date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Senior Note is registered at the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Senior Notes will be subject to redemption by the Senior Notes Issuer. If requested in writing by the Senior Notes Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the applicable Officer's Certificate, the Trustee or the Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited with the Trustee, Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Trustee, for this purpose) to the Holders prior to the applicable redemption date, provided, however, that Holders shall have received at least three Business Days' notice from the Senior Notes Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to Holders prior to the applicable redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Senior Notes are represented by a Global Senior Note deposited with a common depositary for a clearing system, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests as participants of such clearing system will be subject to the then applicable procedures of such clearing system. _Selection and Notice_ If less than all of the Senior Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Paying Agent or the Registrar (as applicable) will select Senior Notes for redemption on a pro rata basis (or, in the case of Senior Notes issued as Global Senior Notes, based on a method that most nearly approximates a pro rata selection (such as by way of pool factor) in accordance with the then applicable procedures of the relevant clearing system), unless otherwise required by law or applicable stock exchange, clearing system or depositary requirements; provided, however, that no Senior Note of £100,000 in aggregate principal amount or less shall be redeemed in part and only Senior Notes in integral multiples of £1,000 will be redeemed. Neither the Trustee, the Paying Agent nor the Registrar will be liable for any selections made in accordance with this paragraph. If any Senior Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a Definitive Registered Note, a new Definitive Registered Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of any Definitive Registered Note redeemed in part will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Definitive Registered Note. In the case of a Global Senior Note, redemption will be effected in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system (including by application of a pool factor) or an appropriate notation will be made on such Global Senior Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Senior Notes called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, unless the Senior Notes Issuer defaults in the payment of 403 ----- the redemption price, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Notes or portions of Senior Notes called for redemption. _Sinking Fund_ The Senior Notes Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with respect to the Senior Notes, except as described under ""—Acquisition Agreement; Timing _of Completion Date and Issue Date; Escrow of Proceeds."" Redemption at Maturity_ On, 2027, the Senior Notes Issuer will redeem the Senior Notes that have not been previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon and Additional Amounts, if any, to, but not including, the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date). _Redemption for Taxation Reasons_ The Senior Notes Issuer may redeem any series of Senior Notes in whole, but not in part, at any time upon giving not less than 10 nor more than 60 days' prior notice to the Holders of the relevant series of Senior Notes (which notice will be irrevocable), at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a ""Tax",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Such Change in Tax Law must be announced and become effective on or after the Issue Date (or if the applicable Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction on a date after the Issue Date, such later date). The foregoing provisions shall apply mutatis mutandis to any successor Person, after such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Notes Indenture, with respect to a change or amendment occurring after the time such successor Person becomes a party to the Senior Notes Indenture. Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under ""—Selection and Notice."" Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor would be obligated to make such payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any series of Senior Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer's Certificate stating that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of recognised standing to the effect that the Senior Notes Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept and shall be entitled to rely on such Officer's Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without liability or further inquiry, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders. 404 ----- _Open Market Purchases, Privately Negotiated Transactions, Tender Offers_ As market conditions warrant, we and our equity holders, including the Permitted Holders, their respective Affiliates and members of our management, may from time to time seek to purchase our outstanding debt securities or loans, including the Senior Notes or derivative instruments related thereto, in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise. Subject to any applicable limitations contained in the agreements governing our Indebtedness, including the Senior Notes Indenture, any purchases made by us may be funded by the use of cash on our balance sheet or the incurrence of new secured or unsecured debt, including borrowings under our credit facilities. The amounts involved in any such purchase transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may be material.

_provided, _however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:_ (1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner of the Senior Notes (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, partner, member or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate, nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, being resident for tax purposes, or being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction), but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition, ownership or holding of such Senior Note or the receipt of any payment or the exercise or enforcement of rights under such Senior Note, the Senior Notes Indenture or a Notes Guarantee; (2) any Tax that is imposed or withheld by reason of the failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Senior Note to comply with a written request of the Payor (or its agent) addressed to the Holder, after reasonable notice (at least 30 days before any such withholding would be payable), to provide certification, information, documents or other evidence concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such beneficial owner or to make any declaration or similar claim or satisfy any other reporting requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or withholding of, all or part of such Tax but, only to the extent the Holder or beneficial owner is legally entitled to provide such certification or documentation;

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies, or if, notwithstanding the Payor's reasonable efforts to obtain such tax receipts, such tax receipts are not obtained, certified copies of other reasonable evidence of such payments as soon as reasonably practicable to the Trustee and the Paying Agent. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the offices of the Paying Agent. If any Payor is obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on any Senior Note or any Notes Guarantee, at least 45 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer's Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable and such other information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer's Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that is 45 days prior to the payment date). The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely, without further inquiry, on such Officer's Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.19,Change of Control,61.19.1,,"The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that if a Change of Control occurs, unless (i) a third party makes a change of control offer as described herein or (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer has previously or substantially concurrently therewith delivered a redemption notice with respect to all the outstanding Senior Notes as described under ""—Optional Redemption,"" the Senior Notes Issuer will make an offer to purchase all of the Senior Notes (provided that Senior Notes of £100,000 or less may only be tendered and repurchased in whole and not in part) pursuant to the offer described below (the ""Change of Control Offer""), at a price in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to but excluding the date of repurchase (the ""Change of Control Payment""); provided_ that if the repurchase date is on or after the record date and on or before the corresponding interest payment date, then Holders in whose name the Senior Notes are registered at the close of business on such record date will receive interest on the repurchase date. Within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver or cause to be delivered a notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically in accordance with the applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee, to each Holder at the address of such Holder appearing in the security register, describing the transaction or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and offering to repurchase the Senior Notes for the specified purchase price on the date specified in the notice (the ""Change of Control Payment Date""), which date will be no earlier than 30 days and no later than the later of (x) 60 days from the date such notice is delivered and (y) the date of completion of the Change of Control, pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior Notes Indenture and described in such notice, except, in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control, as described below. On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Senior Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Notes or portion thereof properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Notes so tendered; (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee and the Principal Paying Agent an Officer's Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes or portions of the Senior Notes being purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer in the Change of Control Offer; (4) in the case of Global Senior Notes, unless notation of the purchase of Senior Notes is to be effected in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Principal Paying Agent the Global Senior Notes, in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Senior Notes or portions thereof that have been tendered to and purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer; and (5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Senior Notes Issuer. If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Notes, and the Trustee (or an authenticating agent) will, at the cost of the Senior Notes Issuer, promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered Notes a new Definitive Registered Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Note will be in a principal amount that is at least £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Notes Indenture does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Senior Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem 407 ----- the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalisation or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder's right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase such Holder's Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if (i) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer or (ii) a notice of redemption of all outstanding Senior Notes has been given pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture as described under ""—Optional Redemption,"" unless and until there is a default in the payment of the applicable redemption price on the applicable redemption date or the redemption is not consummated due to the failure of a condition precedent contained in the applicable redemption notice to be satisfied. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control; provided, however, that such Change of Control Offer is conditional upon such Change of Control. The Senior Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to this covenant. The Senior Notes Issuer may rely on any no-action letters issued by the SEC indicating that the staff of the SEC will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue of the conflict. The Senior Notes Issuer's ability to repurchase Senior Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited by a number of factors. The occurrence of events that constitute a Change of Control would result in Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility becoming immediately due and payable or subject to a mandatory prepayment. Future Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase the Senior Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Senior Notes Issuer. Finally, the Senior Notes Issuer's ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Senior Notes Issuer's then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make any required repurchases. See ""Risk Factors— _Risks Relating to Our Capital Structure, Our Financing and Our Indebtedness—We may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance an offer to repurchase the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes upon the occurrence of certain events constituting a change of control as required by each Indenture.""_ The definition of ""Change of Control"" includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase ""substantially all,"" there is no precise established definition of the phrase ""substantially all"" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of ""substantially all"" of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Senior Notes Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as described above. The provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer's obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness (or any portion thereof) in one or more of the clauses of the second paragraph or the first paragraph of this covenant; provided that any Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clauses (7), (11), (12)(b), (16) and (17) of the second paragraph of this covenant shall cease to be deemed Incurred or outstanding pursuant to such clauses and shall be deemed Incurred and outstanding pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant from and after the first date on which the Senior Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as the case may be, could have Incurred such Indebtedness thereunder (to the extent the Senior Notes Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, are able to reclassify or Incur any Liens securing such Indebtedness under the covenant described under ""—Limitation on Liens"" after such reclassification, if applicable); (2) (A) Senior Secured Notes issued on the Issue Date and any Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities (after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom) in an aggregate principal amount of up to the Sterling Equivalent of £2,250 million, and (B) Indebtedness outstanding on the later of the Issue Date and the Completion Date under the Senior Credit Facilities (after giving effect to the Transactions, including the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom) in an aggregate principal amount of up to the Sterling Equivalent of £935 million shall, in each case, be deemed initially Incurred under clause (1)(i) of the second paragraph of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of this covenant, and may not be reclassified; (3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, letters of guarantee, bank guarantees, bankers' acceptances, performance guarantees, performance bonds, demand guarantees, warranty guarantees, warranty bonds, bond sureties, payment bonds or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included; (4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances, letters of guarantee, bank guarantees, bankers' acceptances, performance guarantees, performance bonds, demand guarantees, warranty guarantees, warranty bonds, bond sureties, payment bonds or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (7), (11), (13), (14), (16) or (17) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and such instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be included; (5) the principal amount of Indebtedness represented by any Disqualified Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; 413 ----- (7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of IFRS; and (8) in the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments to Incur Indebtedness or any Lien pursuant to clauses (10), (28), (30) or (31) of the definition of ""Permitted Liens"" or any Permitted Collateral Lien, the Incurrence thereof for all purposes under the Senior Notes Indenture, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, will, at the Senior Notes Issuer's option, either (a) be determined on the date such commitments are entered into or increased pursuant to binding documentation or (b) be determined on the date such Indebtedness or Liens are Incurred. If the Senior Notes Issuer elects to test Incurrence as described in sub-clause (a), the full amount of Indebtedness made available under such commitments (the ""Reserved Indebtedness Amount""), and the related Liens, will be deemed Incurred on the date of execution of such binding documentation and, if the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio or any other Indebtedness or Lien Incurrence test under the Senior Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing, re-borrowing or issuance of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments thereunder will be permitted under this covenant and under the covenant described under ""—Limitation on Liens,"" irrespective of whether the same Incurrence test is met at the time of actual borrowing, re-borrowing or issuance of letters of credit, bankers' acceptances or other similar instruments thereunder. The Senior Notes Issuer may revoke such election at any time and from time to time. Accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortisation of original issue discount, the payment of interest in the form of additional Indebtedness, the payment of dividends in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments or obligations initially not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in IFRS will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this ""— _Limitation on Indebtedness."" Except as otherwise specified, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding_ as of any date shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount or (b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness. If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary as of such date (and, if such Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this ""— _Limitation on Indebtedness,"" the Senior Notes Issuer will not be permitted to designate such Unrestricted_ Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary and any such designation will not be deemed operative under the Senior Notes Indenture). For purposes of determining compliance with any sterling-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred or, at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, first committed pursuant to binding documentation; _provided_ that, (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a currency other than sterling, and such refinancing would cause the applicable sterlingdenominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such sterling-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded, so long as the principal amount (or, if issued with original issue discount, the aggregate issue price) of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the amount set forth in clause (2) of the definition of Refinancing Indebtedness; (b) the Sterling Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date or Incurred in connection with the Acquisition Transactions on the Completion Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on either the Issue Date or the Completion Date, as applicable; and (c) if any such Indebtedness that is denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to the pound sterling) covering principal amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in sterling will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the 414 ----- currencies in which such Refinancing Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing. Neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any Guarantor will Incur any Indebtedness (including Permitted Debt) that is contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor unless (a) in the case of the Senior Notes Issuer, such Indebtedness is also contractually subordinated in right of payment to the Senior Notes on substantially identical terms, or (b) in the case of any Guarantor, such Indebtedness is pari passu in right of payment with or contractually subordinated to such Guarantor's Notes Guarantee on substantially identical terms; _provided, however, that no Indebtedness will be deemed to be contractually subordinated in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor solely by virtue of being unsecured or by virtue of being secured with different collateral or by virtue of being secured on a junior priority basis or by virtue of the application of waterfall or other payment ordering provisions affecting different tranches of Indebtedness. _Limitation on Restricted Payments_ The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to: (1) declare or pay any dividend or make any other payment or distribution on or in respect of the Senior Notes Issuer's or any Restricted Subsidiary's Capital Stock (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries) except: (a) dividends or distributions payable in Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets, Substitute Retail Assets, balances credited to the Designated Bank Accounts or Post-Completion Disposal Receivables, in Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock), in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer or in Subordinated Shareholder Funding;

and (c) dividends or distributions payable to, payments on Subordinated Shareholder Funding held by, and loans or other advances made to, any Parent to fund payments of interest, premia or break costs in respect of Indebtedness (or any refinancing Indebtedness thereof) of such Parent if (x) such Indebtedness is, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, Guaranteed by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary or is otherwise considered Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, and (y) any net proceeds from such initial Indebtedness are, directly or indirectly, contributed to the equity of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form or otherwise lent to or received by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in any form; provided that (i) any net proceeds described in sub-clause (y) above shall be excluded for purposes of increasing the amount available for distribution pursuant to clause (b)(ii) below and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the second paragraph of this covenant; (2) purchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer or any direct or indirect Parent of the Senior Notes Issuer held by Persons other than the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than in exchange for Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets, balances credited to the Designated Bank Accounts, Substitute Retail Assets, Post-Completion Disposal Receivables or Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock)); (3) make any principal payment on, or purchase, repurchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value, prior to scheduled maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment, any Subordinated Indebtedness (other than (a) any such payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal instalment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of payment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement, and (b) any Indebtedness 415 ----- Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ""—Limitation on Indebtedness"");

Any Lien so created to secure the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture or a Notes Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged upon the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates; and (b) in the case of any property or asset that constitutes Collateral, Permitted Collateral Liens. Any Lien securing the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture or the Notes Guarantees will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged as set forth under ""—Security—Release of _Liens.""_ Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Liens shall be required to secure the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture or the Notes Guarantees over property, assets or Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary that is a member of the Regulated Group or over any intercompany receivables owed by or to members of the Regulated Group; upon any Restricted Subsidiary becoming a member of the Regulated Group, Security Interests over such property, assets, Capital Stock or intercompany receivables shall be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged. _Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_ The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to: (A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, or with respect to any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits; (B) make any loans or advances to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or (C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, 421 ----- _provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_ prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock, and (y) the subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction. The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit: (1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to or arising from (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Credit Facilities, the Senior Secured Bridge Facilities, the Senior Bridge Facility and the Forecourt Disposal Bridge Facility), (b) the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (c) the Senior Secured Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes Indenture, (d) the Acquisition Agreement, (e) the Forecourt SPA, (f) the Escrow Agreement and the Escrow Account Charges, (g) any other agreement or instrument of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the Issue Date that is in effect on or was entered into on the Issue Date or in connection with the Financing Transactions, (h) any other agreement or instrument of the Company and its Subsidiaries that is in effect on the Completion Date, (i) any other agreement or instrument that is necessary or advisable (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management) to consummate the Transactions, or (j) any Forecourt Assets Separation;

provided that, if another Person is the Successor Company (as defined under ""—Merger and Consolidation""), any Subsidiary thereof or agreement or instrument of such Person or any such Subsidiary shall be deemed acquired or assumed by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary when such Person becomes the Successor Company; (3) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement or instrument effecting a refinancing of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to, or that otherwise refinances, an agreement or instrument referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3) (an ""Initial Agreement"") or contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); _provided,_ _however, that the encumbrances and restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or instrument are no less favourable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management); (4) (a) any encumbrance or restriction: (i) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property or asset that is subject to a lease, licence or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer of any lease, licence or other contract;

and (2) at least 75% of the consideration the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of such Asset Disposition consists of: (i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion within 180 days of such Asset Disposition of securities, notes or other obligations received in consideration of such Asset Disposition); (ii) Cash Equivalents; (iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) any liabilities recorded on the Senior Notes Issuer's or such Restricted Subsidiary's balance sheet or the notes thereto (or, if Incurred since the date of the latest balance sheet, that would be recorded on the next balance sheet) (other than Subordinated Indebtedness), as a result of which neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obligated in respect of such liabilities, or (y) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset Disposition, if the Senior Notes Issuer and every other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of such Indebtedness as a result of such Asset Disposition;

or (viii) any combination of the types of consideration specified in clauses (i) through (vii) of this clause (2). If the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Disposition, within 390 days (or such period as provided in clause (H) below, if applicable) of the later of the date of consummation of such Asset Disposition and receipt of such Net Available Cash, the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary may use the Net Available Cash to: (A) (i) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Senior Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary; 424 ----- (ii) unless included in (A)(i), prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) Senior Notes or any other Pari Passu Indebtedness; provided that the Senior Notes Issuer shall be entitled to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem such other Pari Passu Indebtedness that constitutes Public Debt pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Senior Notes Issuer makes (at such time or in compliance with this covenant) an offer to Holders to purchase Senior Notes, in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset Disposition Offer, in such an amount as would reduce the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes then outstanding in the same proportion as the aggregate principal amount of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness would be reduced by such prepayments, repayments, purchases or redemptions; or (iii) prepay, repay, purchase or redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor or any Indebtedness that is secured on assets that do not constitute Collateral (in each case, other than Subordinated Indebtedness of a Guarantor or Indebtedness owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary); (B) purchase any series of Senior Notes pursuant to an offer to all Holders of such series of Senior Notes, redeem (including through open market purchases, voluntary tender offers or privately negotiated transactions at market prices) any series of Senior Notes pursuant to the redemption provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture or by making an Asset Disposition Offer to all Holders of the Senior Notes (in accordance with the procedures set out below); (C) invest in any Replacement Assets; (D) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Person engaged in a Similar Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, such Person is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; (E) make a capital expenditure; (F) acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock and cash or Cash Equivalents) that are used or useful in a Similar Business; (G) consummate any combination of the foregoing; or (H) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Available Cash pursuant to clause (A), (C), (D), (E) or (F) of this paragraph or a combination thereof, provided that, a binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Available Cash from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such investment is consummated, and (y) the 180th day following the expiration of the aforementioned 390-day period, if the investment has not been consummated by that date. The amount of such Net Available Cash not so used as set forth above constitutes ""Excess Proceeds."" Pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash, the Senior Notes Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture. On the 391st day (or the 571[st ]day if a binding commitment as described in clause (H) is entered into) after an Asset Disposition, or such earlier time as the Senior Notes Issuer elects, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds £50.0 million, the Senior Notes Issuer will be required within 10 Business Days thereof to make an offer (""Asset Disposition Offer"") to all Holders and, to the extent the Senior Notes Issuer elects, to all or some holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal amount of Senior Notes and any Pari Passu Indebtedness that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price, in respect of the Senior Notes, equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, and, in respect of such Pari Passu Indebtedness, of no more than 100% of the principal amount thereof, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but not including, the date of purchase. The Asset Disposition Offer in respect of Senior Notes will be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture, in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. To the extent that the aggregate amount of Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Senior Notes Issuer may use any remaining Excess Proceeds (the ""Retained Declined Proceeds"") for 425 ----- any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture. If the aggregate amount of Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the tendering holders of Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness pro rata based on the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and such Pari Passu Indebtedness so tendered and not properly withdrawn. For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness tendered in an Asset Disposition Offer that is not denominated in sterling, such principal amount shall be converted into its Sterling Equivalent as of a date selected by the Senior Notes Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period or no more than five Business Days prior to the beginning of the Asset Disposition Offer Period. Upon completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero. To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Senior Notes is denominated in a currency other than the currency in which the relevant Senior Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in respect of such Senior Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Senior Notes are denominated that is actually received by the Senior Notes Issuer upon converting such portion of the Net Available Cash into such currency. The Asset Disposition Offer, insofar as it relates to the Senior Notes, will remain open for a period of not less than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the ""Asset Disposition Offer Period""). No later than five Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the ""Asset",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,61,DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES,61.21,"Disposition Purchase Date""), the Senior Notes Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Senior Notes",61.21.1,,"and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness required to be repaid or purchased by it pursuant to such offer (the ""Asset Disposition Offer Amount"") or, if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Senior Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer. On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Senior Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness or portions of Senior Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Senior Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn and in minimum denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The Senior Notes Issuer will deliver to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate stating that such Senior Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the Senior Notes Issuer in accordance with the terms of this covenant. The Senior Notes Issuer or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, will promptly (but in any case not later than five Business Days after termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder an amount equal to the purchase price of the Senior Notes so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Senior Notes Issuer for purchase. Any Senior Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred or returned in accordance with applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream) by the Senior Notes Issuer to the Holder thereof. The Senior Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Senior Notes pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall not consummate Sale and Leaseback Transactions with any Person (other than the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) that, when taken together with all Sale and Leaseback Transactions consummated since the Issue Date, would yield, in aggregate, gross proceeds of more than the lesser of (x) £1,200 million and (y) £1,400 million minus the aggregate principal amount of all Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (12)(b) of the definition of ""Permitted Debt"" and outstanding at the time of determination. The provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer's obligation to make an Asset Disposition Offer may be waived or modified with the consent of Holders of a majority in outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes (with such consent, for the avoidance of doubt, to be considered effective if the aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes of consenting Holders represents a majority of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Senior Notes as a whole and without regard to the level of consent obtained among Holders of each constituent series of Senior Notes). 426 ----- _Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_ The Senior Notes Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer (any such transaction or series of related transactions being an ""Affiliate Transaction"") involving aggregate value in excess of the greater of 10% of Consolidated EBITDA and £120 million unless: (1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction, taken as a whole, are not materially less favourable to the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a comparable transaction with a Person who is not an Affiliate at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing for such transaction in arm's-length dealings; and (2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of the greater of 20% of Consolidated EBITDA and £240 million, the terms of such transaction or series of related transactions have been approved by a resolution of the Board of Directors of the Senior Notes Issuer resolving that such transaction complies with clause (1) above. The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to: (1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under ""—Limitation on Restricted Payments,"" any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under ""—Limitations on Restricted Payments"") or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted Investments as defined in paragraphs (1)(b) and (2) of the definition thereof); (2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to the terms of, the funding of, entering into or maintenance of (i) any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement and any related trust or other similar agreement, (ii) any other compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, (iii) restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans, stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants' plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement, savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or (iv) indemnities provided on behalf of officers, employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Senior Notes Issuer, in each case, in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; (3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto; (4) any transaction between or among the Senior Notes Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries or any Securitisation Subsidiary; (5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities (including under customary insurance policies) and employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or employees of the Senior Notes Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent (whether directly or indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers or employees); (6) (i) the Transactions, excluding the ASDA Leases, and (ii) the ASDA Leases, to the extent entered into or replaced or amended from time to time on terms substantially consistent with those described in this Offering Memorandum; (iii) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the Issue Date under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect; (iv) the entry into and performance of obligations of the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction pursuant to or contemplated 427 ----- by, and any payments pursuant to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Completion Date, as these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed, replaced or refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect; and (v) the entry into and performance of any registration rights or other listing agreement; (7) the execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or any arrangement pursuant to which the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries is required or permitted to file a consolidated tax return, or the formation and maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management purposes in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice; (8) transactions with customers, contractors, clients, franchisees, licensees, sublicensees, cross-licensees, landlords (including superior landlords), lessors, sub-lessors, trade creditors, service providers, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each case in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice, which are fair to the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or a member of Senior Management, or are on terms no less favourable than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party; (9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business or consistent with past practice between or among the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity; (10) (a) issuances or sales of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares) of the Senior Notes Issuer or options, warrants or other rights to acquire such Capital Stock or Subordinated Shareholder Funding; provided that the interest rate and other financial terms of such Subordinated Shareholder Funding are approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors in their reasonable determination, and (b) any amendment, waiver or other transaction with respect to any Subordinated Shareholder Funding in compliance with the other provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, as applicable; (11) (a) payments by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Affiliate (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) of fees and related expenses for strategic or operational advisory services in an aggregate amount not to exceed £10 million per year, and (b) customary payments by the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to any Permitted Holder (whether directly or indirectly, including through any Parent) for financial advisory, financing, underwriting or placement services or in respect of other investment banking activities, including in connection with loans, capital market transactions, acquisitions or divestitures, which payments (or agreements providing for such payments) in respect of this clause (11) are approved by a majority of the Board of Directors in good faith; (12) any transactions for which the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary delivers to the Trustee a letter from an Independent Financial Advisor stating that such transaction is (i) fair to the Senior Notes Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or (ii) on terms not less favourable than might have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an arm's-length basis from a Person who is not an Affiliate; (13) investments by any of the Equity Investors in securities of any of the Senior Notes Issuer's Restricted Subsidiaries (and the payment of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses of the Equity Investors in connection therewith) so long as (i) the investment complies with clause (1) of the preceding paragraph, (ii) the investment is being offered generally to other investors on the same or more favourable terms and (iii) the investment constitutes less than 5% of the proposed issue amount of such class of securities; 428 ----- (14) any transaction effected as part of a Qualified Securitisation Financing; (15) any participation in a public tender or exchange offers for securities or debt instruments issued by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries that are conducted on arms' length terms and provide for the same price or exchange ratio, as the case may be, to all holders accepting such tender or exchange offer; (16) any transaction effected as part of or in connection with a Permitted Reorganisation or in connection with an Initial Public Offering in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement (including as described under ""Description of Certain Financing Arrangements—Intercreditor Agreement— _Provisions Following an IPO""); and_ (17) any transactions that comply with the parameters prescribed in one or more framework agreements that establish the terms governing contracts or transactions between the parties from time to time, _provided_ the relevant framework agreement or framework agreements have been duly approved by the Board of Directors and the terms of such agreement or agreements, taken as a whole, are no less favourable than could reasonably be obtained in a comparable framework agreement in arm's-length dealings with an unaffiliated party at the time of entry into binding documentation. _Reports_ So long as any Senior Notes are outstanding, the Senior Notes Issuer will furnish to the Trustee the following reports: (1) within 120 days (or, in the case of the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021, 150 days) after the end of the Senior Notes Issuer's fiscal year, annual reports containing, to the extent applicable: (i) an operating and financial review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operation, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources (which, for the avoidance of doubt, will not need to include divisional or segment financial information other than as required under IFRS); (ii) unaudited pro forma income statement and balance sheet information of the Senior Notes Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions or dispositions that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such annual report relates (other than the Acquisition and unless such pro forma information has been provided in a previous report provided pursuant to clauses (2), (3) or (4) below); provided that such pro forma_ financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Senior Notes Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials; (iii) the audited consolidated balance sheet of the Senior Notes Issuer as at the end of the most recent fiscal year and audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Senior Notes Issuer for the most recent two fiscal years, including appropriate footnotes to such financial statements, for and as at the end of such fiscal years and the report of the independent auditors on the financial statements;

and (ii) within 90 days after the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company ending prior to the Completion Date, the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheet as at the end of such quarter and unaudited condensed statements of income and cash flow for the most recent quarter or year-to-date period ending on the unaudited condensed balance sheet date, prepared in accordance with IFRS;

(ii) unaudited _pro forma_ income statement and balance sheet information of the Senior Notes Issuer, together with explanatory footnotes, for any material acquisitions, dispositions or recapitalisations that have occurred since the beginning of the most recently completed fiscal year as to which such quarterly report relates (other than the Acquisition and provided that such pro forma financial information will be provided only to the extent available without unreasonable expense, in which case the Senior Notes Issuer will provide, in the case of a material acquisition, acquired company financials); (iii) a concise operating and financial review of the unaudited financial statements, including a discussion of the consolidated financial condition, results of operations and material changes in liquidity and capital resources of the Senior Notes Issuer;

provided that, if the Senior Notes Issuer intends to make a public announcement of the appointment of a new senior executive officer other than by means of a report pursuant to this clause (4), the Senior Notes Issuer may delay furnishing such report to the Trustee until the day on which the Senior Notes Issuer otherwise makes such public announcement. In addition, the Senior Notes Issuer shall furnish to the Holders and to prospective investors, upon the request of such parties, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act for so long as the Senior Notes are not freely transferable under the Exchange Act by persons who are not ""affiliates"" under the Securities Act. The Senior Notes Issuer shall also make available to Holders and prospective holders of the Senior Notes copies of all reports furnished to the Trustee on the Senior Notes Issuer's website. All financial statement information shall be prepared in accordance with IFRS and on a consistent basis for the periods presented, except as may otherwise be described in such information; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1), (2), (3) and (4) above may, in the event of a change in IFRS, present earlier periods on a basis that applied to such periods. Except as specified in the second succeeding paragraph, no report need include separate financial statements for the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the reports set forth above will not be required to contain any reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer may satisfy its obligations under the preceding paragraphs of this covenant by delivering the corresponding consolidated annual and quarterly reports or other information of the Company or any Parent of the Company, for so long as the Company or such Parent is either a Subsidiary or a Parent of the Senior Notes Issuer. To the extent that material differences exist between the management, business, assets, shareholding or results of operations or financial condition of such other reporting entity and the Senior Notes Issuer, the annual and quarterly reports shall include a concise description and an unaudited reconciliation of such material differences. Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Senior Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. At any time that any of the Senior Notes Issuer's subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a Significant Subsidiary of the Senior Notes Issuer, then the quarterly and annual financial information required by the first paragraph of this ""Reports"" covenant will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer. 430 ----- All reports provided pursuant to this ""Reports"" covenant shall be made in the English language. In the event that (i) the Senior Notes Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC or (ii) the Senior Notes Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good faith judgment of the Senior Notes Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and procedures), for so long as it elects, the Senior Notes Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports, information, documents and other reports that the Senior Notes Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Senior Notes Issuer will be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in the preceding paragraphs. Following an initial public offering of the Capital Stock of an IPO Entity or the listing of such Capital Stock on a recognised stock exchange, the reporting obligations of the reporting entity pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this covenant shall be considered to have been fulfilled if the IPO Entity complies with the reporting requirements of such stock exchange (other than with respect to delivery of a compliance certificate). _Merger and Consolidation_ The Senior Notes Issuer The Senior Notes Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related transactions to, any Person, unless: (1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the ""Successor Company"") will be a Person organised and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union, the United Kingdom, Jersey, the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the Senior Notes Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreements (if any) and the Security Documents, as applicable; (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Successor Company or any Subsidiary of the Successor Company as a result of such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be able to Incur at least an additional £1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the covenant described under ""—Limitation on Indebtedness"" or (b) the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio would not be less than it was immediately prior to giving effect to such transaction; and (4) the Senior Notes Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer's Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each to the effect that execution and delivery of the binding documentation providing for such consolidation, merger or transfer and of such supplemental indenture (if any) do not result in a breach of the Senior Notes Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental indenture (if any) has been duly authorised, executed and delivered and is a valid and binding agreement, enforceable against the Successor Company in accordance with its terms (in each case, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), _provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel, counsel may rely on an Officer's Certificate as to any matters of fact. Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto, shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under ""—Limitation on Indebtedness."" 431 ----- For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Senior Notes Issuer to any person other than the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, which properties and assets, if held by the Senior Notes Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Notes Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Senior Notes Issuer. The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor company will not be released from its obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes. There is no precise established definition of the phrase ""substantially all"" under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve ""substantially all"" of the property or assets of a Person. The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this ""Merger _and Consolidation"" covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition_ if the Senior Notes Issuer has complied with the covenant described under ""—Limitation on Sales of Assets _and Subsidiary Stock"" or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary._ The Guarantors No Guarantor (other than a Guarantor whose guarantee is to be released in accordance with the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement) may: (1) consolidate with or merge with or into any Person (whether or not such Guarantor is the surviving corporation); (2) sell, assign, convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, all or substantially all of the assets of such Guarantor and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole, in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to any Person; or (3) permit any Person to merge with or into it unless: (A) the other Person is the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Guarantor or, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, becomes a Guarantor (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); (B) (1) either (x) a Guarantor is the continuing Person or (y) the resulting, surviving or, subject to the Agreed Security Principles, the transferee Person expressly assumes all of the obligations of the Guarantor under its Notes Guarantee and the Senior Notes Indenture (pursuant to a supplemental indenture executed and delivered in a form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee); and (2) immediately after giving effect to the transaction, no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and is continuing; or (C) the transaction constitutes a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of a Guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of a Guarantor (in each case other than to the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) otherwise permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture, _provided, however, that the prohibition in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of this heading ""—The Guarantors""_ shall not apply to the extent that compliance with clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B)(1) could give rise to or result in: (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws rules or regulations (or analogous restriction) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or (except in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership); or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. 432 ----- _General_ The provisions set forth in this ""Merger and Consolidation"" covenant shall not restrict (and shall not apply to): (i) any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor from consolidating with, merging or liquidating into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Senior Notes Issuer, a Guarantor or any other Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor; (ii) a Guarantor from merging or liquidating into or transferring all or part of its properties and assets to the Senior Notes Issuer or another Guarantor; (iii) a Guarantor transferring all or part of its properties and assets to a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor in order to comply with any law, rule, regulation or order, recommendation or directions of, or agreement with, any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries; (iv) any consolidation or merger of the Senior Notes Issuer into any Guarantor; _provided_ that, if the Senior Notes Issuer is not the surviving entity of such merger or consolidation, the relevant Guarantor will assume the obligations of the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes, the Senior Notes Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents and clauses (1) and (4) under the heading ""—Senior Notes Issuer"" shall apply to such transaction; (v) a Permitted Reorganisation or the solvent liquidation of any Restricted Subsidiary; (vi) the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor consolidating into or merging or combining with an Affiliate incorporated or organised for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of such entity, reincorporating such entity in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal form of such entity; _provided, _however, that clauses (1), (2) and (4) under the heading ""—The Senior Notes Issuer"" or clauses (3)(A) and_ (3)(B) under the heading ""—The Guarantors,"" as the case may be, shall apply to any such transaction; and (vii) any corporate reorganisations or other steps necessary or advisable to consummate or facilitate the Transactions. _Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_ If on any date following the Issue Date, the Senior Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a ""Suspension Event""), then, beginning on that day and continuing until such time, if any, at which the Senior Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the ""Reversion Date""), the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture summarised under the following captions will not apply to the Senior Notes: (1) ""—Limitation on Restricted Payments""; (2) ""—Limitation on Indebtedness""; (3) ""—Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries""; (4) ""—Limitation on Affiliate Transactions""; (5) ""—Additional Notes Guarantees""; (6) ""—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock""; and (7) the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under ""—Merger and Consolidation—The Senior Notes Issuer"" and, in each case, any related default provision of the Senior Notes Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with regard to actions of the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default. The ""Limitation on Restricted Payments"" covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the Senior Notes Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under _""—Limitation on Indebtedness,"" as applicable. In addition, the Senior Notes Indenture will also permit,_ without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honour any contractual commitments or take actions in the future after any date on which the Senior Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Senior Notes no longer having an Investment Grade Status. The Senior Notes Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under this caption has been satisfied, _provided_ that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the covenants described under this caption to be effective. 433 ----- There can be no assurance that the Senior Notes will ever achieve or maintain an Investment Grade Status. _Impairment of Security Interest_ Holdco and the Senior Notes Issuer shall not, and in each case, shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or knowingly or negligently omit to take any action that would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being understood that neither the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens, nor any Forecourt Assets Separation, nor any repayment of intercompany receivables from time to time (including the Forecourt Disposal Receivable), nor any distribution or disposal of Warehouse Assets, Select Retail Assets, Substitute Retail Assets, Designated Bank Accounts or Post-Completion Disposal Receivables shall under any circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interests with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders, and Holdco and the Senior Notes Issuer shall not, and in each case, shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other beneficiaries described in the Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that: (i) Holdco, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged and released and retaken in accordance with the Senior Notes Indenture, the applicable Security Documents, the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to the extent applicable in each case;

(iii) any Permitted Reorganisation may be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture; (iv) any corporate reorganisations or other steps necessary or advisable to consummate or facilitate the Transactions may be implemented; or (v) the Security Documents may otherwise be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, released and retaken, or replaced where, contemporaneously with any such action, the Senior Notes Issuer delivers to the Trustee: (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, from an Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or Holdco and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as applicable, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or replacement, (2) a certificate from the Board of Directors of the relevant Person confirming the solvency of the person granting such Security Interest, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release or replacement, or (3) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, release, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Documents, so amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement. 434 ----- In the event that Holdco, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (as applicable) comply with the requirements of this covenant, the Trustee and the Security Agent shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the need for instructions from the Holders. _Additional Notes Guarantees_ No Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor shall Guarantee (i) any Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor under any Syndicated Term Facilities, (ii) any Indebtedness of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Guarantor under any other Credit Facility that provides for aggregate lending commitments in excess of £50.0 million at the relevant date of determination, or (iii) any Public Debt, unless such Restricted Subsidiary is or becomes a Guarantor by no later than 10 Business Days after the date on which the Guarantee is Incurred and, if applicable, executes and delivers to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form attached to the Senior Notes Indenture pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary will provide a Notes Guarantee; provided that: (a) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be required to provide a Notes Guarantee pursuant to this covenant as a result of Incurring a Guarantee under clause (2)(b) of the definition of ""Permitted Debt""; (b) no Restricted Subsidiary that is a member of the Regulated Group shall be required to provide a Notes Guarantee pursuant to this covenant; and (c) no Restricted Subsidiary shall be obligated to become a Guarantor pursuant to this covenant to the extent that, and for so long as, the Incurrence of such Notes Guarantee would be inconsistent with the Agreed Security Principles or may reasonably be expected to give rise to or result in (1) any breach or violation of statutory limitations, corporate benefit, financial assistance, fraudulent preference, thin capitalisation rules, capital maintenance rules, guidance and coordination rules or the laws, rules or regulations (or analogous restrictions) of any applicable jurisdiction; (2) any risk or liability for the officers, directors or shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) which cannot be avoided through measures reasonably available to the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, other than reasonable expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory filings undertaken in connection with such Notes Guarantee. At the option of the Senior Notes Issuer, any Notes Guarantee may contain limitations on such Guarantor's liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognise certain defences generally available to guarantors (including those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of creditors generally) or other considerations under applicable law. Future Notes Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released as set forth under ""— _Notes Guarantees."" A Notes Guarantee of a future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the_ Senior Notes Issuer if, at the date of such release, there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate any release of a Notes Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to each of the Trustee and the Security Agent being indemnified and/or secured to its satisfaction. The validity and enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests and the liability of each Guarantor will be subject to the limitations as described and set out in ""Risk Factors"" and ""Certain _Insolvency Considerations and_ _Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the Notes Guarantees and the Security Interests."" Financial Calculations_ When determining whether any transaction is permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer shall be permitted to test it, at its option, (i) on the date binding documentation for such transaction is entered into, (ii) on the date that any notice of any repayment, redemption, repurchase or refinancing of any Indebtedness is given to the holders thereof (if applicable), (iii) to the extent the nature or circumstances of a transaction make (i) or (ii) inapplicable, on the date that notice of such transaction is provided to the Holders in accordance with the provisions described in ""—Notices"" below or (iv) the date such transaction is consummated. If the Senior Notes Issuer elects to test the transaction as described in clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the determination as to whether the transaction is permitted under the Senior 435 ----- Notes Indenture shall be made assuming that the transaction and other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith were consummated on the date binding documentation was entered into or such notice was given to the Trustee or the Holders (each, an ""Alternative Testing Date""), as applicable. If the transaction was permitted on the Alternative Testing Date chosen by the Senior Notes Issuer, it shall continue to be deemed so permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture even if it would have otherwise resulted in a Default or an Event of Default on the date it is consummated. When determining whether any transaction is permitted under the Senior Notes Indenture as of the Alternative Testing Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will make all necessary calculations as set forth under the definition of ""Consolidated Net _Leverage Ratio.""_ If the Senior Notes Issuer has elected to test a transaction on an Alternative Testing Date (an ""Alternative Testing Date Election""), the transaction shall be deemed to have occurred on such date for the purposes of making any other determination under the Senior Notes Indenture, until such time (the ""Election Termination Time"") as (a) the transaction is definitively terminated, cancelled or abandoned, (b) the Senior Notes Issuer has revoked its Alternative Testing Date Election and has instead opted to test the transaction on the date it is consummated, which the Senior Notes Issuer will be entitled to do, irrevocably and only once, at any time until the transaction is consummated, or (c) the transaction is consummated. From the time the Senior Notes Issuer makes an Alternative Testing Date Election to the related Election Termination Time, the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture will apply assuming that the relevant transaction was consummated on the Alternative Testing Date. No action properly taken by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries between an Alternative Testing Date Election and the related Election Termination Time will constitute a Default or an Event of Default under the Senior Notes Indenture. In addition, the Senior Notes Indenture will permit, without causing a Default or Event of Default, the Senior Notes Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honour any contractual commitments undertaken during such period of time, so long as they were not undertaken in anticipation of the Election Termination Time. _Topco Covenant_ Within 10 Business Days (or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter to the extent that consent or requirements of third parties are required to be obtained or satisfied) after all amounts due and payable under the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility have been repaid in full or the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility has otherwise been irrevocably satisfied and discharged, the Senior Notes Issuer shall procure that Topco and its controlled Affiliates contribute to the equity of the Senior Notes Issuer, lend to the Senior Notes Issuer as Subordinated Shareholder Funding or apply toward repayment of PostCompletion Disposal Receivables held by the Senior Notes Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries: (i) any Select Retail Assets and Substitute Retail Assets owned by Topco or any such controlled Affiliates of Topco at such time, and (ii) an amount equal to any Net Available Cash received by Topco or any such controlled Affiliates of Topco from sale and leaseback transactions or other disposals in respect of such assets (including any Retail Asset Disposal Proceeds) that have not been applied toward repayment or prepayment of the Distribution Asset Disposal Bridge Facility (each such contribution, loan or repayment a ""Retail Assets Contribution""). For the avoidance of doubt, any failure by Topco or any of Topco's controlled Affiliates to make any required Retail Assets Contributions shall constitute a default of the Senior Notes Issuer's obligation to procure such contributions. Neither Topco nor any of Topco's controlled Affiliates, other than Holdco, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Guarantors, will become parties to, or otherwise be bound by, the terms of the Senior Notes Indenture. In addition, neither the Senior Notes Issuer nor any of its Restricted Subsidiaries have the direct power to control the management or policies of Topco or any of its controlled Affiliates (other than the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries).

A Default under clauses (4) or (6) of the preceding paragraph will not constitute an Event of Default unless the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture notify the Senior Notes Issuer of the Default and the Senior Notes Issuer fails to cure such Default within the time specified in clauses (4) or (6), as applicable, of the preceding paragraph, after receipt of such notice. If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (5) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Senior Notes Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture, by written notice to the Senior Notes Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the request of such Holders shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture, to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal, premium and accrued and unpaid interest will be due and payable immediately. For the avoidance of doubt, the bankruptcy 437 ----- provisions will exclude the enforcement of Liens described in clause (31) of the definition of ""Permitted _Liens,"" including by way of appointment of a receiver for such purpose._ In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (4) under ""Events of Default"" has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Senior Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (4) has been remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default has been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Senior Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all other Events of Default outstanding, except nonpayment of principal, premium or interest on the Senior Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Senior Notes, have been cured or waived. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Senior Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Holders of the Senior Notes may not enforce the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes except as provided in the Senior Notes Indenture and may not enforce the Security Documents except as provided in such Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture may waive all past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to non-payment of principal, premium, interest or Additional Amounts, if any) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Senior Notes and its consequences if rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction. Subject to the provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Senior Notes Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes unless: (1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security and/or indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity; and (5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes have not given the Trustee a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. Other than in cases where the Senior Notes Indenture permits the Trustee or the Security Agent to act without instructions from Holders or with instructions given by Holders of a lower percentage of principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Senior Notes under the Senior Notes Indenture will be entitled to (i) direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee under the Senior Notes Indenture, (ii) give instructions to the Security Agent for the purpose of taking, ceasing or refraining from taking any enforcement action under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, (iii) give instructions to the Security Agent for the purpose of granting or withholding any such consent or exercising any such remedy or power as may be required or contemplated under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents, or (iv) give instructions to the Trustee for the purposes of giving or withholding any such consent, taking, ceasing or refraining from taking any such action or exercising any such remedy or power as may be contemplated under the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Documents. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that, in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, of which a responsible officer of the Trustee has received written notice, the Trustee will be 438 ----- required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Notes Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Senior Notes Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification and/or security satisfactory to it against all losses, liabilities and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such occurrence by the Senior Notes Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being notified by the Senior Notes Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on any Senior Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer's Certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default or Event of Default that occurred during the previous year. The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee (and the Trustee shall be able to rely without further inquiry on), within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute certain Defaults, their status and what action the Senior Notes Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in connection with another default (an ""Initial Default"") then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured without any further action, and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled ""—Certain Covenants—Reports"" or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Notes Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Unless otherwise specified by the Senior Notes Issuer, no Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the written consent or waiver as to such Holder's Senior Note or portion of the Senior Note once delivered to the Senior Notes Issuer. After an amendment or waiver becomes effective, it shall bind every Holder. The Senior Notes Issuer may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give their written consent or take any other action. If a record date is fixed, then only those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies) shall be entitled to give such consent (and revoke any consent previously given, if relevant) or to take any such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No consent shall be valid or effective for more than 180 days after such record date.

The Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes sold outside the United States in offshore transactions pursuant to Regulation S will initially be represented by one or more global notes in registered form without interest coupons attached (the ""Regulation S Global Notes"" and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the ""Global Notes""). On the Issue Date, the Global Notes will be deposited with a common depositary and registered in the name of the nominee of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests in the Global Notes on behalf of their participants through customers' securities accounts in their respective names on the books of their respective depositories. Except under the limited circumstances described below, Book-Entry Interests will not be issued in definitive form. Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book-entry form by, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. Book-Entry Interests for the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes will be issued only in denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The Group will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes; however, owners of the Book-Entry Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable. Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear and/or Clearstream will credit a participant's account on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of those securities in definitive form.

In addition, while the Notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the owners or ""holders"" of Notes for any purpose. So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary of Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or its respective nominee) will be considered the sole holder of the Global Notes for all purposes under the Indentures. As such, participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and indirect participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream and the participants through which they own Book-Entry Interests to transfer their interests or to exercise any rights of holders of the Notes under the Indentures.

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuers that upon request by an owner of a Book- Entry Interest described in the immediately preceding clause (2), their current procedure is to request that the relevant Issuer issue or cause to be issued Notes in definitive registered form to all owners of Book-Entry Interests and not only to the owner who made the initial request.

Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the Euroclear or Clearstream systems will receive distributions attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through Euroclear or Clearstream participants.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Pursuant to Regulation (EU) no. 2015/848 of the European Parliament and of the Council of May 20, 2015 on insolvency proceedings (which applies to insolvency proceedings opened on or after June 26, 2017), (the ""Recast Insolvency Regulation""), which applies within the European Union, other than Denmark, the courts of the Member State in which a company's ""centre of main interests"" (""COMI"") is situated have jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings. Article 3(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation states that a company's COMI ""shall be the place where the debtor conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties"" and that in the case of a company or legal person, COMI is presumed to be located in the country of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary, though that presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Recital 30 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation contains a number of examples of where a presumption as to COMI may be rebutted: for instance, if the company's central administration is located in a Member State other than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company's actual centre of management and supervision and the centre of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In that respect, the factors that courts may take into consideration when determining the COMI of a debtor can include where board meetings are held, the location where the debtor conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the debtor's creditors are established. This means that a company's COMI is not a static concept and may change from time to time as the determination of where a company has its COMI is depends on the facts and circumstances as at the date the company enters an insolvency proceeding and on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognise the judgment of the court commencing main proceedings, which will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary insolvency proceedings or territorial insolvency proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in the Member State (in which the debtor's COMI is situated) which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of that Member State in another Member State (other than Denmark) (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State). These powers are subject to certain limitations (e.g. the powers are available provided that no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State nor any preservation measure to the contrary has been taken there further to a request to commence secondary proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets). If the ""COMI"" of a company is in one Member State (other than Denmark), under Articles 3(2) to Article 3(4) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) only have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings against that company if such company has an ""establishment"" in the territory of such other Member State, and such insolvency proceedings must be ""secondary."" Secondary proceedings may be any insolvency proceeding listed in Annex A of the Recast Insolvency Regulation and for the avoidance of doubt, are not limited to winding-up proceedings. An ""establishment"" is defined in Article 2(1) of the Recast Insolvency Regulation to mean ""any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the 3-month period prior to the request to 492 ----- open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets."" Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State (other than Denmark) will only be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the 3-month period prior to the request for opening of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those secondary insolvency proceedings opened in that other Member State are restricted to the assets of the company situated in such other Member State. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State (other than Denmark) where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor's COMI is situated because of the conditions laid down by that Member State's law; or (ii) the opening of territorial insolvency proceedings is requested by (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the opening of territorial proceedings is requested, or (b) a public authority which, under the law of the Member State within the territory of which the establishment is situated, has the right to request the opening of insolvency proceedings. When main insolvency proceedings are opened, territorial insolvency proceedings become secondary insolvency proceedings. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or secondary or territorial insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed by the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. In addition, the concept of ""group coordination proceedings"" has been introduced in the Recast Insolvency Regulation with the aim of bolstering efficiency in the insolvency of several members of a group of companies. Under Article 61 of the Recast Insolvency Regulation, group coordination proceedings may be requested before any court having jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of a member of the group, by an insolvency practitioner appointed in insolvency proceedings opened in relation to a member of the group. Participation by the insolvency practitioner of the relevant member of the group in the group coordination proceedings and adherence to the coordinating insolvency practitioner's recommendations or plan however is voluntary. In the event that any of the Issuers or Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations and the security of the Issuers or Guarantors. The United Kingdom ceased to be a member of the EU on January 31, 2020, 11.00 p.m. (""exit day"") and therefore is no longer a Member State. The EUWA (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020) provides that direct EU legislation (which term includes any EU regulation as it had effect in EU law immediately before exit day (subject to certain exceptions)) converts directly applicable EU law (which includes regulations) as it stood at the end of the transition period into UK domestic law. However, whilst direct EU legislation may continue to form a part of domestic law of the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period, it may be subject to a number of amendments. The Insolvency (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 (SI 2019/146) sets out a number of amendments to be made to the Recast Insolvency Regulation, as it will apply in the United Kingdom after the end of the transition period. On December 30, 2020 the European Union and the United Kingdom formally signed the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement. This agreement provisionally applies from January 1, 2021, but is still subject to formal approval by the European Parliament. At this stage, there remains considerable political, legislative and regulatory uncertainty throughout the region and the extent to which Brexit could adversely affect business activity, restrict the movement of capital and the mobility of personnel and goods, and otherwise impair political stability and economic conditions in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, the EU and elsewhere. Any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on business activity in the United Kingdom, the Eurozone, or the EU. Further, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement does not include a replacement for the current automatic recognition of UK insolvency procedures across the EU and vice versa. In the absence of an agreement allowing automatic recognition, it will be harder for UK office holders and UK restructuring and insolvency proceedings to be recognised in EU member states and to effectively deal with assets located in EU member states. Much will then depend upon the private international law rules in the particular EU member state and the need may well arise to open parallel proceedings, increasing the element of risk. In particular in cases where the appointment of a UK office holder has been made in reliance on a UK domestic approach rather than the COMI rules, it is much less certain that there will be recognition in the relevant EU member state. 493 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Subject to specific conditions, a court can make an administration order if the court is satisfied that the relevant company is or is likely to become ""unable to pay its debts"" and that the administration order is reasonably likely to achieve the purpose of administration. Without limitation and subject to specific conditions, an English company, the directors of such company or the holder of a qualifying floating charge (discussed below), where the floating charge has become enforceable, may also appoint an administrator out of court process, subject to certain exceptions pursuant to the Insolvency Act. The purpose of an administration is comprised of three objectives that must be looked at successively: rescuing the company as a going concern or, if that is not reasonably practicable, achieving a better result for the company's creditors as a whole than would be likely upon immediate liquidation or, if neither of those objectives is reasonably practicable, and the interests of the creditors as a whole are not unnecessarily harmed thereby, realising property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors. 494 ----- The rights of creditors, including secured creditors, are curtailed in an administration pursuant to the statutory moratorium imposed under the Insolvency Act. Upon the appointment of an administrator, no step may be taken to enforce security or a guarantee over the company's property except with the consent of the administrator or permission of the court. The same requirements for consent or permission apply to the institution or continuation of legal process (including legal proceedings, execution, distress and diligence) against the company or property of the company. In either case, a court will consider discretionary factors in determining any application for leave in light of the hierarchy of statutory objectives of administration described above. Accordingly, if any of the Issuers, the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral were to enter into administration, the Notes, the Notes Guarantees, the Collateral, as applicable, could not be enforced against that company while it was in administration without the permission of the court or consent of the administrator. There can be no assurance that the Trustees, or the Security Agent, as applicable, would obtain this permission of the court or consent of the administrator. In addition, while an administrator is in office, the powers of the boards of directors of the Issuers, the Guarantors or the providers of Collateral (save those that do not interfere with the exercise of that administrators' powers, and those permitted by the administrator) are suspended, and an administrator is given wide powers to conduct the business and, subject to certain requirements under the Insolvency Act, dispose of the property of a company in administration (including property subject to a floating charge). A secured creditor cannot appoint an administrative receiver while an administrator is in office although, in certain circumstances (principally where one of the exceptions to the general prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver applies as set out in the Insolvency Act), the holder of a floating charge can block the appointment of an administrator where it can appoint an administrative receiver. However, the general prohibition against enforcement by secured creditors without consent of the administrator or permission of the court, and the administrator's powers with respect to property subject to a floating charge, does not apply to any security interest created or arising under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Agreements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (UK) (the ""Financial Collateral Regulations""). A financial collateral arrangement includes (subject to certain other conditions) a security interest over financial collateral (including a floating charge, a pledge, a mortgage, a fixed charge or a lien) in a company, where both the collateral provider and collateral taker are non-natural persons.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

In order to constitute a qualifying floating charge for these purposes, the floating charge must be created by an instrument which (a) states that the relevant statutory provision applies to it; (b) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrator of the company; or (c) purports to empower the holder to appoint an administrative receiver within the meaning given by Section 29(2) of the Insolvency Act. A party will be the holder of a qualifying floating charge if he holds one or more debentures of the company secured: (a) by a qualifying floating charge which relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's property; (b) by a number of qualifying floating charges which together relates to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's property; or (c) by charges and other forms of security which together relate to the whole or substantially the whole of the company's property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge. The most relevant exception to the prohibition on the appointment of an administrative receiver is the exception relating to ""capital market arrangements"" (as defined in paragraph 1 of Schedule 2A of the Insolvency Act), which may apply if the issue of the Notes creates a debt of at least £50.0 million for the relevant English company during the life of the arrangement and the arrangement involves the issue of a ""capital market investment"" (which is defined in the Insolvency Act, and is generally a rated, listed or traded debt instrument). If an administrative receiver has been appointed, an administrator can only be appointed by the court (and not by the company, its directors or the holder of a qualifying floating charge using the out of court procedure) and then only if the person who appointed the administrative receiver consents or the court considers that the security pursuant to which the administrative receiver was appointed is capable of challenge as a transaction at an undervalue, a preference or an invalid floating charge. If an administrator is appointed, any administrative receiver will vacate office, and any receiver of part of the company's property must resign if required to do so by the administrator. 495 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Once the liquidator has completed this task, the company is dissolved and removed from the register of companies. There are two forms of winding-up: (i) compulsory liquidation, by order of the court; and (ii) voluntary liquidation, by resolution of the company's members, and which is in turn divided into members' voluntary liquidation (""MVL"") and creditors' voluntary liquidation (""CVL""). The primary ground for the compulsory winding-up of an insolvent company is that it is unable to pay its debts (as described above). The effect of a compulsory winding-up differs in a number of respects from that of a voluntary windingup. In a compulsory winding-up, under Section 127 of the Insolvency Act, any disposition of the relevant company's property made after the commencement of the winding-up is, unless sanctioned by the court, void. However, this will not apply to any property or security interest subject to a disposition or created or otherwise arising under a ""financial collateral arrangement"" under the Financial Collateral Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in accordance with its terms. Subject to certain exceptions, when an order is made for the winding-up of a company by the court, it is deemed to have commenced from the time of the presentation of the winding-up petition. Once a winding-up order is made by the court, a stay of all proceedings against the company will be imposed. No legal action may be continued or commenced against the company without permission of the court. In the context of a voluntary winding-up however, there is no equivalent to the retrospective effect of a winding-up order; the winding-up commences on the passing of the resolution to wind up. As a result, there is no equivalent of Section 127 of the Insolvency Act for a voluntary winding-up. There is also no automatic stay in the case of a voluntary winding-up - it is for the liquidator, or any creditor or shareholder of the company, to apply for a stay. This is important because, in the absence of a stay being obtained, it means secured creditors for example can go ahead and enforce their security. A MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court. Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding-up resolution, the directors must swear a statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after having made full enquiry into the company's affairs, they have formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts, including interest and the costs of the MVL process, within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation. A CVL is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company into liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a statutory declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent). If the creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors' choice will prevail. A liquidator has, among other things, the power to bring or defend legal proceedings on behalf of the company, to carry on the business of the company as far as it is necessary for its beneficial winding-up, to sell the company's property and execute documents in the name of the company and to challenge antecedent transactions. Under English insolvency law, a liquidator has the power to disclaim any onerous property, which is any unprofitable contract and any other property of the company that cannot be sold, readily sold or may give rise to a liability to pay money or perform any other onerous act. A contract may be unprofitable if it gives rise to prospective liabilities and imposes continuing financial obligations on the company that may be detrimental to creditors. However, this power does not apply to a contract where all of the obligations have been performed nor can it be used to disturb accrued rights and liabilities. In addition, the power to disclaim onerous property does not apply where the collateral-provider or collateral-taker under the arrangement is being wound up, to any financial collateral arrangement. 496 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Under the Insolvency Act and the Insolvency (England and Wales) Rules 2016, creditors are placed into different classes, with the proceeds from the realisation of the insolvent company's property applied in descending order of priority, as set out below. With the exception of the Prescribed Part (as defined below), distributions generally cannot be made to a class of creditors until the claims of the creditors in a prior ranking class have been paid in full. Unless creditors have agreed otherwise with the company, distributions are made on a pari passu basis, that is, the assets are distributed in proportion to the debts due to each creditor within a class. The general priority on insolvency is as follows (in descending order of priority): - First ranking: holders of fixed charge security but only to the extent the value of the secured assets covers that indebtedness and creditors with a proprietary interest in assets in the possession (but not full legal and beneficial ownership) of the debtor but only with respect to the assets in which they have a proprietary interest; - Second ranking: expenses of the insolvent estate (there are statutory provisions setting out the order of priority in which expenses are paid); - Third ranking: ordinary and secondary preferential creditors. o Ordinary preferential debts include (but are not limited to) debts owed by the insolvent company in relation to: (i) contributions to occupational and state pension schemes; (ii) wages and salaries of employees for work done in the four months before the insolvency date, up to a maximum of £800 per person; (iii) holiday pay due to any employee whose contract has been terminated, whether the termination takes place before or after the insolvency date; and (iv) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (""FSCS"") up to the statutory limit. o Secondary preferential debts include (i) bank and building deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that claims exceed the statutory limit; and (ii) VAT and other certain tax debts due to HMRC as set out in section 386 and paragraph 15D of Schedule 6 of the Insolvency Act. These rank for payment after the discharge of the ordinary preferential debts. As between one another, all claims within each category rank equally; - Fourth ranking: holders of floating charge security, according to the priority of their security. o This would include any floating charge that was stated to be a fixed charge in the document that created it but which, on a proper interpretation, was rendered a floating charge. However, before distributing asset realisations to the holders of floating charges, the Prescribed Part (as defined below) must, subject to certain exceptions, be set aside for distribution to unsecured creditors; - Fifth ranking: o firstly, provable debts of unsecured creditors (save where such creditors are deferred under section 74(2(f)) of the Insolvency Act) and any secured creditor to the extent of any unsecured shortfall, in each case including accrued and unpaid interest on those debts up to the date of commencement of the relevant insolvency proceedings. These debts rank equally among themselves unless there are subordination agreements in place between 497 ----- any of them. To pay the secured creditors any unsecured shortfall, the insolvency officeholder can only use realisations from unsecured assets, as secured creditors are not entitled to any distribution from the Prescribed Part unless the Prescribed Part is sufficient to pay out all unsecured creditors; o secondly, interest on the company's unsubordinated debts (at the higher of the applicable contractual rate and the official rate) in respect of any period after the commencement of liquidation, or after the commencement of any administration which preceded such liquidation. However, in the case of interest accruing on amounts due under the Notes or the Notes Guarantees, such interest due to the holders of the Notes may, if there are sufficient realisations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries; and o thirdly, non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and therefore are only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid; and - Sixth ranking: shareholders. If after the repayment of all unsecured creditors in full, any remaining funds exist, these will be distributed to the shareholders of the insolvent company. Subordinated creditors are ranked according to the terms of the subordination language in the relevant documentation (and provided that such terms do not contravene the Insolvency Act). An insolvency practitioner of a company (e.g. an administrator, administrative receiver or liquidator) will generally be required to ring-fence a certain percentage of the proceeds of enforcement of floating charge security for the benefit of unsecured creditors (after making full provision for preferential creditors and expenses out of floating charge realisations) (the ""Prescribed Part"").

A party is associated with an individual if they are (i) a relative of the individual, (ii) the individual's husband, wife or civil partner, (iii) a relative of the individual's husband, wife or civil partner, or (iv) the husband, wife or civil partner of a relative of the individual.

They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii) preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244). These provisions all apply where the company has gone into an English liquidation or administration, with the exception of section 423 which can be invoked even if the company is not in insolvency proceedings. _Transactions at an undervalue_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a consideration the value of which (in money or money's worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or money's worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the relevant time (two years before the onset of insolvency (as described below)); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business; and (ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the company. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction at an undervalue, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts unless a beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (see ""Connected persons"" above), in which case there is a presumption of insolvency and the connected person must demonstrate that the company was not unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction or became unable to do so as a consequence of the transaction. An order by the court for a transaction at an undervalue may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person with whom the company entered into the transaction, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the transaction in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the person was a party to the transaction. _Preferences_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company's creditors, a surety or a guarantor for any of the company's debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position he would have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than he would have been in if the thing had not been done or suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of Connected Persons); (iv) the preference was given within the relevant time (six months before the onset of the insolvency or two years from the onset of insolvency where the transaction is with a Connected Person); and (v) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. If the court determines that the transaction was a preference, the court shall make such order as it sees fit to restore the company to the position it would have been in had it not entered into the transaction. 499 ----- In any proceedings, it is for the administrator or liquidator to show that the English company was unable to pay its debts at the relevant time and that there was such desire to prefer the relevant creditor. If, however, the beneficiary of the transaction was a connected person (except where such beneficiary is a connected person by reason only of being the company's employee), it is presumed that the company intended to put that person in a better position and the connected person must demonstrate that there was, in fact, no such desire on the part of the company to prefer them. An order by the court for a preference may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person whether or not they are the person to whom the preference was given, but such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the English company in good faith and for value or prejudice any interest deriving from such an interest, and will not require a person who received a benefit from the preference in good faith and for value to pay a sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company, except where the payment is to be in respect of a preference given to that person at a time when they were a creditor of the English company. _Voidable floating charges_ If a company goes into an English administration or liquidation, a floating charge created by that company over its property may be invalid if it was created at a relevant time. Where the transaction is with a Connected Person, this means within a period of two years before the onset of insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of 12 months before the onset of insolvency when the company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the Insolvency Act. This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the charge (as consists of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon) supplied to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the charge. No court action is required. Section 245 of the Insolvency Act does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations. _Transactions defrauding creditors_ A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see above); and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who is making or may make a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing his interests. It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. This provision may be used by any person who claims to be a ""victim"" of the transaction (with the leave of the court if the company is in liquidation or administration) and is not therefore limited to liquidators or administrators and, subject to certain conditions, the UK Financial Conduct Authority and the UK Pensions Regulator. The Insolvency Act also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action. The fact that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defence to the claim. It will suffice that the company's subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice. If the court determines that the transaction was a transaction defrauding creditors, the court can make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to what it would have been if the transaction had not been entered into and to protect the interests of the victims of the transaction. The relevant court order may affect the property of, or impose any obligation on, any person, whether or not he is the person with whom the transaction was entered into. However, such an order will not prejudice any interest in property which was acquired from a person other than the debtor company in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances, and will not require a person who received a benefit from such transaction in good faith, for value and without notice of the relevant circumstances to pay any sum to the liquidator or administrator of the company unless such person was a party to the transaction. _Extortionate credit transactions_ If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit transaction, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside. A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either: (i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies) in respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing. 500 ----- The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and preferences). _Orders_ In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e. not section 245), the court has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that which existed before the transaction was entered into.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Whether the purported fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed security interests rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on whether the secured party has the requisite degree of control over the chargor's ability to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the security holder in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the assets that are the subject of a purported fixed charge in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee, the court would be likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge. While recharacterisation is a risk for all attempts to create fixed security, it is a particular risk in relation to attempts to create fixed security over receivables. This is because even if a company purports to grant fixed security over its receivables, it will likely retain, in practice, the ability to deal with its receivables in its discretion and without the consent of the chargee. If any fixed security interests are recharacterised as floating security interests, the claims of (i) any unsecured creditors of the relevant English Obligor in respect of that part of the chargor's net property which is ring fenced (see explanation about ring fencing above); and (ii) certain statutorily defined preferential creditors of the chargor may have priority over the rights of the security agent to the proceeds of enforcement of such security. In addition, as mentioned above, the expenses of a liquidation or administration would also rank ahead of the claims of the security agent as floating charge holder.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

More specifically, such a transaction must be allowed by the respective company's memorandum and articles of association. To the extent that the above do not allow such an action, there is the risk that the grant of the guarantee and the subsequent security can be found to be void and the respective creditor's rights unenforceable. Some comfort may be obtained for third parties if they are dealing with an English Obligor in good faith, however the relevant legislation is not without difficulties in its interpretation. Further, corporate benefit must be established for each English Obligor in question by virtue of entering into the proposed transaction. Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006 provides that a director must act in the way that he considers, in good faith, would be most likely to promote the success of the English Obligor for the benefit of its members as a whole. If the directors enter into a transaction where there is no or insufficient commercial benefit, they may be found as abusing their powers as directors and such a transaction may be vulnerable to being set aside by a court. Section 172(3) of the Companies Act 2006 additionally provides that, in certain circumstances, the directors need to consider or act in the interests of the creditors of the company. While the statutory provisions do not prescribe when directors' duties to creditors arise, the Court of Appeal has recently held that the shift takes place when the directors know, or should know, that the company in question is or is likely to become insolvent, with ""likely"" in this context meaning ""probable."" 501 ----- Security and/or guarantees granted by an English Obligor may also be subject to potential limitations to the extent they would result in unlawful financial assistance contrary to UK company law. Under UK company law, subject to limited exceptions, any security granted by a charging company incorporated in England and Wales (including security governed by law other than English or Scots law) (together with prescribed particulars of the relevant security) may be delivered to the Registrar of Companies for registration within 21 days after the date of creation of the relevant security interest. While the Companies Act 2006 does not impose an obligation as such on English companies to register security created on or after April 6, 2013, security will be deemed to be void against a liquidator, administrator and any creditor of the applicable charging company if not registered within the 21-day period. When security becomes so void, the debt which was intended to be secured by such security is deemed to become immediately payable. In limited circumstances, it may be possible to apply to the English for an order to rectify a failure to register and allow the relevant charge to be registered after the 21-day period has expired. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 21-day period has been extended to 31 days under the Companies etc. (Filing Requirements) (Temporary Modifications) Regulations 2020.

The English courts have jurisdiction to sanction a scheme of arrangement that effects a compromise of a company's liabilities with respect to its creditors (or any class of its creditors) where such company (i) is liable to be wound-up under the Insolvency Act and (ii) has ""sufficient connection"" to the English jurisdiction. In practice, a non-English company is likely to satisfy the first limb of this test and the second limb has been found to be satisfied where, amongst other things, the company's ""centre of main interests"" is in England, the company's finance documents are English law governed, or the company's finance documents have been amended in accordance with their terms to be governed by English law. Ultimately, each case will be considered on its particular facts and circumstances so previous cases will not necessarily determine whether or not any of the grounds of the second limb are satisfied in the present case. Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on the proposed compromise or arrangement in respect of their claims in a single class or in a number of classes, depending on the rights of such creditors that will be affected by the proposed scheme and any new rights that such creditors are given under the scheme. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or its creditors. If a majority in number representing 75% or more by value of those creditors present and voting at the meeting(s) of each class of creditors vote in favour of the proposed scheme, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance documents, then that scheme will (subject to the sanction of the court) be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did not participate in the vote and those who voted against the scheme. The scheme then needs to be 502 ----- sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing where the court will review the fairness of the scheme and consider whether it is reasonable. The court has discretion as to whether to sanction the scheme as approved, make an order conditional upon modifications being made or reject the scheme.

Some of these measures had been proposed in August 2018 but were fast-tracked through the United Kingdom legislative process in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The measures include the following: _Moratorium_ Part A1 of the Insolvency Act, as introduced by CIGA 2020, provides a standalone moratorium which can benefit certain distressed companies by giving them various protections from creditors and providing them with a breathing space to formulate a rescue and/or restructuring plan. The moratorium is a 'debtorin-possession' process, meaning that a company in a moratorium remains under the management of its directors, but the moratorium is supervised by an insolvency practitioner, called a 'monitor'. Not all companies are eligible for the moratorium. Schedule ZA1 to the Insolvency Act sets out a number of exclusions from eligibility which includes companies that are a party to capital markets arrangements where the debt incurred (or, when entering into the agreement, expected to be incurred) was at least £10 million (at any time during the life of the capital market arrangement) and the arrangement involves the issue of a capital market investment. This includes, amongst other things, secured and unsecured debt, but the debt instrument either has to be rated, listed, traded (or designed to be rated, listed or traded), or bonds or commercial paper issued to professional, high net worth or sophisticated investors. _Ipso Facto Clauses Prohibited_ CIGA 2020 introduced a permanent prohibition on the operation and exercise of termination clauses and the imposition of amended terms by a supplier in contracts for goods and services, which would have been triggered by the counterparty company being made subject to a relevant insolvency procedure. Such procedures include winding-up and administration, as well as the new moratorium and restructuring plan. Other rights to terminate under the contract (i.e. other than on the counterparty being subject to a relevant insolvency procedure) are preserved, to the extent the termination event arises after commencement of the insolvency proceeding. A supplier may be allowed to terminate the contract if the company or the relevant insolvency practitioner consents or if permission is granted by the court on it being satisfied that the continuation of the contract would cause the supplier hardship. Financial services contracts and entities involved in financial services are not affected by this new prohibition. _Restructuring Plan_ CIGA 2020 also provides for a new restructuring process, similar to a scheme of arrangement under the Companies Act 2006 (see ""Scheme of Arrangement""), but with an ability for a cross-class cram-down to bind dissenting stakeholders to the restructuring plan proposed. This new standalone restructuring plan under Part 26A of the Companies Act 2006 is available to any company that is liable to be wound up under the Insolvency Act. The Secretary of State is given the express power to exclude regulated companies providing financial services from being able to propose a restructuring plan, and may also provide for other exclusions as to the type of debtor company or creditor entities that may be party to a restructuring plan. The company must: (i) have encountered, or be likely to encounter, financial difficulties that are affecting, or will or may affect, its ability to carry on business as a going concern; and (ii) have proposed a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members (or any class of either of them) for the purpose of eliminating, reducing, preventing or mitigating the effect of such financial difficulties. There is no financial eligibility criteria, thereby making it available to both solvent and insolvent companies (in the latter case, the plan would be proposed by the incumbent insolvency practitioner). The process closely resembles that for schemes of arrangement, whereby a proposed restructuring plan must be filed at court as part of the proponent's application to convene a meeting of creditors or members. At the convening hearing, the court will examine the classes of stakeholders and whether it has jurisdiction to make judgment on the proposed restructuring plan. Once the court is satisfied it has jurisdiction and with the allocation of classes, it will order a meeting of each class of creditors/members to vote on the proposed restructuring plan: details of such meeting(s) must be sent to every stakeholder 503 ----- in each class, accompanied by a statement explaining the effect of the plan and state any material interests of the directors of the company and the effect on those interests of the plan insofar as it is different from the effects on the like interests of other persons. Creditors and members whose rights would be affected by the restructuring or compromise arrangement must be permitted to participate in the relevant meeting, unless they have been excluded by reason of having no genuine economic interest in the company. The creditors/members of a class are deemed to approve a restructuring plan if at least 75% in value of the creditors/members of that class who are present and voting (in person or by proxy) have voted in favour of the proposals. Unlike with a scheme of arrangement, there is no requirement for a majority in number of those creditors present and voting to vote in favour of a restructuring plan for class approval to be given. As stated above, a restructuring plan has an additional feature which a scheme or arrangement does not have, a ""cross-class cram down"" provision. This allows the court to sanction a restructuring plan even if not all of the relevant classes of creditors and/or members have voted in favour of it. In order for the court to sanction a cross-class cram down the court must be satisfied that none of the dissenting classes are any worse off under the plan than they would be in the event of the ""relevant alternative"" (being whatever the court considers would be most likely to occur in relation to the company if the restructuring plan were not sanctioned); and that the plan has been agreed by 75% in value of a class of creditors or members present and voting (in person or by proxy) who would receive a payment, or have a genuine economic interest in the company, in the event of the relevant alternative. Similar to a scheme of arrangement, a restructuring plan then needs to be sanctioned by the court at a sanction hearing. Although there are no provisions which expressly set out how the court's discretion is to be exercised, the court will draw on the principles applicable to schemes. For example, the court may refuse to grant sanction if it considers that the restructuring plan is not just and equitable. Parties' rights following confirmation of a restructuring plan will be as provided for in the plan and any previous rights will be extinguished. Unlike an administration proceeding, the commencement of a restructuring plan does not trigger a moratorium on claims or proceedings, although the directors may apply for moratorium (see above) to provide protection pending the sanction of the plan if the relevant company is eligible. _Statutory demands and winding-up petitions (temporary measure)_ CIGA 2020 (as amended) has temporarily suspended the ability of creditors to present a winding-up petition during the period between April 27, 2020 and March 31, 2021 (subject to change) on the basis of a company's inability to satisfy a statutory demand where the statutory demand was served between March 1, 2020 and March 31, 2021, unless the creditor has reasonable grounds to believe that COVID19 did not have a financial effect on the company or that the company's inability to pay its debts would have existed even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the company. With regards to petitions that have been presented during this period but before CIGA 2020 came into force, the court can make such order as it thinks appropriate to restore the position to what it would have been if the petition had not been presented. This could lead to the voiding of winding-up orders made in respect of such petitions. Similarly, no winding-up orders may be made by the courts during this period on the basis of an inability to pay debts if: (i) it appears to the court that COVID-19 had a financial effect on the company before the presentation of the petition, and (ii) the court is not satisfied that the inability to pay debts would have existed even if COVID-19 had not had a financial effect on the company. Any winding-up orders made during this period but before CIGA 2020 came into force will be void and the court can give directions to the insolvency official to restore the company to its ""pre-petition"" position. _So-called ""Henry VIII"" powers_ CIGA 2020 further confers on the UK government some extensive powers to make a range of further amendments to corporate insolvency and governance legislation under delegated regulations. For example, regulations may be made to amend or modify the conditions that must be met before an insolvency procedure applies to certain entities, or the way in which the procedure applies, or to change or disapply a person's corporate duties and liabilities.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Similarly, the UK Cross-Border Insolvency Regulations 2006, which implement the UNCITRAL Model Law on Cross-Border Insolvency in the United Kingdom, provide that a foreign court may have jurisdiction where any English company has its COMI in such foreign jurisdiction, or where it has an ""establishment"" (being a place of operations in such foreign jurisdiction, where it carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and assets or services). English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which investors may be familiar. In the event that an English Obligor experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, including by the company or a creditor making an application for administration in court, the company, its directors or the holder of a ""qualifying floating charge"" (discussed below) making an application for administration out of court, or by a creditor filing a petition to wind up the company or the company resolving to do so (in the case of a liquidation). The following is a brief description of certain aspects of English insolvency law relating to certain limitations on the Notes Guarantees and the security interests over the Collateral. The application of these laws could adversely affect investors, their ability to enforce their rights under the Notes Guarantees and/or the Collateral securing the Notes and the Notes Guarantees and therefore may limit the amounts that investors may receive in an insolvency of any English Obligor",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The Scottish security is limited to fixed security over real estate located in Scotland and is provided by Guarantors incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. We therefore refer you to the English law sections above in relation to security and guarantees granted by English Guarantors in all respects, save for those specifically dealt with below in relation to Scottish fixed security. 504 ----- In Scotland, forms of fixed security are closely tied to specific types of property. Since Scots law does not recognise the English law concept of ""equity"" there is more focus on the legal formalities rather than the intention of the parties with respect to the creation of fixed security interests. If the strict legal requirements under Scots law are not met, there will be no security over the subject notwithstanding the intention of the parties. In respect of movable property, it is essential that the security holder has some form of possession (which may take different forms) over the subject in order to create a valid fixed security interest. Scots law does not differentiate between legal and equitable ownership of property so, for instance, in order to create a security interest over shares in companies incorporated in Scotland, the security holder (or its nominee) must be registered as the shareholder. Furthermore, as there is no Scottish equivalent of an English law equitable assignment, a Scottish interest in incorporeal property will only be created when the assignation is properly notified to the relevant parties. Fixed charges over land and buildings situated in Scotland may only be created using a ""standard security"" (which is the Scots law equivalent of a legal mortgage over an interest of land and is governed by statute, including in relation to how the security must be enforced). Scots law does not recognise the office of receiver except in the specific instance of a receiver appointed by, or on the application of, the holder of a floating charge created as such by a company with such appointments or applications being subject to the restrictions noted in the sections above relating to English Guarantors (see in particular ""—Administrative receivership"" above).",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Under insolvency laws in Northern Ireland, there is a possibility that a court could find that the fixed security interests expressed to be created by a security document could take effect as floating charges because the description given to them as fixed charges is not determinative. Whether fixed security interests will be upheld as fixed rather than floating security interests will depend, among other things, on 505 ----- whether the chargee has the requisite degree of control over the ability of the relevant chargor to deal in the relevant assets and the proceeds thereof and, if so, whether such control is exercised by the chargee in practice. Where the chargor is free to deal with the secured assets without the consent of the chargee, the court is likely to hold that the security interest in question constitutes a floating charge, notwithstanding that it may be described as a fixed charge.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The Insolvency Act 1986 (either as originally enacted or as amended, including by the provisions of the Enterprise Act 2002) does not apply in Jersey and receivers, administrative receivers and administrators are not part of the laws of Jersey. Accordingly, the Jersey courts may not recognise the powers of an administrator, administrative receiver or other receiver appointed in respect of Jersey situs assets. The Royal Court (in its inherent jurisdiction) may, however, under Article 49(1) of the Jersey Bankruptcy Law assist the courts of prescribed countries and territories and, applying general principles of comity, assist the courts in other jurisdictions, in all matters relating to the insolvency of any person to the extent that the Royal court thinks fit. Further, in doing so, the Royal Court may have regard to the UNCITRAL model law, even though the model law has not been (and is unlikely to be) implemented as a separate law in Jersey. If insolvency proceedings have been commenced in another jurisdiction in relation to the company, the nature and extent of the cooperation from Jersey is likely to depend on the nature of the requesting country's insolvency regime. In the case of both statutory and non-statutory requests for assistance, it should be noted that the UNCITRAL provisions will not automatically be followed, as this is a matter for the discretion of the Royal Court. The court's position may also not be in accordance with EU Insolvency Regulation. Jersey does not form part of the European Community for the purposes of implementation of its directions. Accordingly, the EU Insolvency Regulation does not apply as a matter of Jersey domestic law, and thus the automatic test of centre of main interests does not apply.

Although the issue is not free from doubt, the Issuers intend to take the position that the foregoing contingencies should not cause the Notes to be treated as contingent payment debt instruments under the applicable Treasury Regulations. Assuming such position is respected, a U.S. holder would be required to include in income the amount of any such payments at the time such payments are received or accrued in accordance with such U.S. holder's method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Issuers' position is binding on a U.S. holder, unless the U.S. holder discloses in the proper manner to the IRS that it is taking a different position. If the IRS successfully challenged this position, and the Notes were treated as contingent payment debt instruments, U.S. holders could be required to accrue interest income at a rate higher than the stated interest rate on such Notes, regardless of the holder's method of accounting, and to treat as ordinary income, rather than capital gain, any gain recognised on a sale, exchange, retirement, redemption or other taxable disposition of a Note. The balance of this discussion assumes that the Notes will not be considered contingent payment debt instruments.

A U.S. holder that uses the cash method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognise interest income equal to the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment, based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars at such time. A cash basis U.S. holder will not realise foreign currency exchange gain or loss on the receipt of stated interest but may recognise exchange gain or loss attributable to the actual disposal of the foreign currency received. A U.S. holder that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, or who otherwise is required to accrue interest prior to receipt, may determine the amount recognised with respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, such holder will recognise income for each taxable year equal to the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency accrued for such year determined by translating such amount into U.S. dollars at the average spot rate of exchange in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the U.S. holder's taxable year). Alternatively, an accrual basis U.S. holder may make an election (which must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the electing U.S. holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies or thereafter acquired by the U.S. holder, and cannot be changed without the 511 ----- consent of the IRS) to translate accrued interest income at the spot rate of exchange on the last day of the accrual period (or the last day of the taxable year in the case of a partial accrual period), or at the spot rate of exchange on the date of receipt, if that date is within five business days of the last day of the accrual period. A U.S. holder of Notes that uses the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes will recognise foreign currency gain or loss, on the date such interest is received, equal to the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of such payment, determined at the spot rate of exchange on the date the payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income previously included in respect of such payment. This exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss, generally will be treated as U.S.-source and generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income or expense.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

A series of Notes will be treated as issued with OID if the stated principal amount of such Notes exceeds their issue price (as defined above) by an amount equal to or greater than a statutorily defined de _minimis amount (generally, 0.0025 multiplied by the stated principal amount and the number of complete years to maturity from the issue date). In the event a series of Notes is issued with OID, U.S. holders of such Notes generally will be required to include such OID in gross income (as ordinary income) for U.S. federal income tax purposes on an annual basis under a constant yield accrual method regardless of their regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, such U.S. holders generally will include any OID in income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to such income. The amount of any OID with respect to a Note of such series includible in income by a U.S. holder is the sum of the ""daily portions"" of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion thereof in which such U.S. holder holds such Note. A daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any ""accrual period"" a pro rata portion of the OID that accrued in such period. The accrual period of a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs either on the first or last day of an accrual period. The amount of OID that accrues with respect to any accrual period is the excess of (i) the product of the Note's ""adjusted issue price"" at the beginning of such accrual period and its ""yield to maturity,"" determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of such period, over (ii) the amount of stated interest allocable to such accrual period. The adjusted issue price of a Note at the start of any accrual period generally is equal to its issue price, increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. The yield to maturity of a Note is the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value of all principal and interest payments to be made under the Note, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the Note. OID, if any, on the Notes will be determined for any accrual period in foreign currency and then translated into U.S. dollars in accordance with either of the two alternative methods described in the third paragraph under ""—Payments of Stated Interest."" A U.S. holder of a Note issued with OID will recognise foreign currency exchange gain or loss when OID is paid (including, upon the disposition of such Note, the receipt of proceeds that include amounts attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference, if any, between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received, translated at the spot rate of exchange on the date such payment is received, and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID, as determined in the manner described above. For these purposes, all receipts on such Note will be viewed first, as payment of stated interest payable on the Note; second, as receipt of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first; and third, as receipt of principal. Foreign currency exchange gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss and be treated, for foreign tax credit purposes, as U.S. source income or loss, and generally not as an adjustment to interest income or expense.

The cost of a Note purchased with foreign currency will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency purchase price on the date of purchase, calculated at the spot rate of exchange in effect on that date. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the cost of the Note at the spot rate of exchange on the settlement date of the purchase. The conversion of U.S. dollars to a foreign currency and the immediate use of that currency to purchase a Note generally will not result in taxable gain or loss for a U.S. holder. Upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note, a U.S. holder generally will recognise gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realised (other than amounts attributable to accrued and unpaid stated interest, which will be taxable as ordinary interest income in accordance with the U.S. holder's method of tax accounting as described above to the extent not previously included in income by the U.S. holder) and the U.S. holder's adjusted tax basis in the Note. The amount realised on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note for an amount of foreign currency generally will be the U.S. dollar value of that amount based on the spot rate of exchange on the date of taxable disposition. If the Note is traded on an established securities market, a cash basis taxpayer (and, if it elects, an accrual basis taxpayer) will determine the U.S. dollar value of the amount realised on the settlement date of the disposition. If an accrual method taxpayer makes the election described above, such election must be applied consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. An accrual basis U.S. holder that does not make the special election will recognise exchange gain or loss to the extent that there are exchange rate fluctuations between the disposition date and the settlement date, and such gain or loss generally will constitute ordinary income or loss. Gain or loss recognised by a U.S. holder upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note that is attributable to changes in currency exchange rates will be ordinary income or loss and, with respect to the principal thereof, generally will be equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder's purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition, and the U.S. dollar value of the U.S. holder's purchase price of the Note in foreign currency determined on the date the U.S. holder acquired the Note. The exchange gain or loss with respect to principal and with respect to accrued and unpaid stated interest and, if any, accrued OID (which will be treated as discussed above under ""—Payments _of Stated Interest"" or ""—Original Issue Discount,"" as applicable) will be recognised only to the extent of_ the total gain or loss realised by the U.S. holder on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note, and will be treated as ordinary income generally from sources within the United States for U.S. foreign tax credit limitation purposes. Any gain or loss recognised by a U.S. holder in excess of foreign currency gain or loss recognised on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition. If any such gain is subject to foreign income tax, U.S. holders may not be able to credit such tax against their U.S. federal income tax liability, unless such income tax can be credited (subject to applicable limitations) against U.S. federal income tax due on other income treated as derived from foreign sources. Alternatively, the U.S. holder may deduct such taxes in computing taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes, provided that the U.S. holder does not elect to claim a foreign tax credit for any foreign income taxes paid or accrued for the relevant taxable year. In the case of a noncorporate U.S. holder (including an individual), net long-term capital gain may be eligible for preferential U.S. federal income tax rates compared to items of ordinary income if the U.S. holder satisfies certain prescribed minimum holding periods. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.

Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchaser. Stabilising transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying Note so long as the stabilising bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilising or covering transaction to cover short positions. In connection with the Offering, Barclays Bank plc (the ""Stabilisation Manager""), or persons acting on its behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilise, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in the open markets for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. The Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may also over-allot either the Offering (which involves sales in excess of the offering size), creating a short position for the Initial Purchasers, and may bid for and purchase Notes in the open market to cover such short position. In addition, the Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase Notes in market-making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. This occurs when a particular Initial Purchaser repays to the Initial Purchasers a portion of the underwriting discount received by it because the Stabilisation Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, have repurchased Notes sold by or for the account of such Initial Purchaser in stabilising or short covering transactions. These activities may stabilise or maintain the respective market price of the Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The Stabilisation Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. These stabilising transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of the Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the Offering is made and, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time without notice at the sole discretion of the Stabilisation Manager.

Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuers, the Target or their respective affiliates. The Initial Purchasers and/or their affiliates may receive allocations of the Notes (subject to customary closing conditions), which could affect future trading of the Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with either of the Issuers, the Target or their respective affiliates routinely hedge their credit exposure to them, and the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may in the future otherwise act as hedge counterparties to the Issuers, the Target or their respective subsidiaries, in each case consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the securities of the Issuers, the Target or their respective subsidiaries, including potentially the Notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Notes offered hereby.

Ernst & Young LLP has undertaken its audit work, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006, to state to the Company's members those matters that it is required to state to them in an auditor's report and for no other purpose. Investors in the Notes should understand that these statements are intended to disclaim any liability to parties (such as purchasers of the Notes) other than to the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to those reports. The SEC would not permit such limiting language to be included in a registration statement or a prospectus used in connection with an offering of securities registered under the Securities Act, or in a report filed under the U.S. Exchange Act. If a U.S. court (or any other court) were to give effect to the limitation above, the recourse that investors in the Notes may have against the independent auditors based on their reports or the consolidated financial statements to which they relate could be limited. The extent to which auditors have responsibility or liability to third parties is unclear under the laws of many jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, and the legal effect of these statements in the audit reports is untested in the context of an offering of securities.

1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.1,England and Wales and Scotland,215.1.1,,"The following summary with respect to the enforceability of certain U.S. court judgments in England and Wales and Scotland is based upon advice provided to us by U.S., English and Scottish legal advisers. The United States and England and Scotland currently do not have a treaty between them providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments (as opposed to arbitration awards) in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment for payment rendered by any federal or state court in the U.S. based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, would not automatically be recognised and/or enforced in England and Wales or in Scotland. In order to enforce any such U.S. judgment in England and Wales or Scotland, proceedings must first be initiated before a court of competent jurisdiction in England and Wales or Scotland (as applicable). In such an action, an English or Scottish court would not generally reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by the U.S. court (subject to what is said below) and it would usually be possible to obtain summary judgment (or summary decree in Scotland) on such a claim (assuming that there is no good defence to it). Recognition and enforcement of a U.S. judgment by an English or Scottish court in such an action is conditional upon (among other things) the following: - the U.S. court having had jurisdiction over the original proceedings according to English or Scottish conflicts of laws principles and rules of English or Scottish private international law; - the U.S. judgment not having been given in breach of a jurisdiction or arbitration clause; - the U.S. judgment being final and conclusive on the merits in the sense of being final and unalterable in the court which pronounced it and being for a definite sum of money; - the U.S. judgment not contravening English or Scottish public policy or the Human Rights Act 1998; - the U.S. judgment not being for a sum payable in respect of taxes, or other charges of a like nature, or in respect of a penalty or fine, or otherwise involving the enforcement of a nonEnglish or non-Scottish penal or revenue law; - the U.S. judgment not being contrary to the Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980; - the U . S . judgment not having been obtained by fraud or in breach of English or Scottish principles of natural justice; - there not having been a prior inconsistent decision of an English or Scottish court in respect of the same matter involving the same parties; and - the English or Scottish enforcement proceedings being commenced within the relevant limitation period. If an English or Scottish court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the English or Scottish judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. The judgment creditor is able to utilise any method or methods of enforcement available to him/her at the time. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain an English or Scottish judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, if the judgment debtor has any set-off or counter-claim against the judgment creditor or if an appeal is pending or anticipated against the judgment or against the foreign judgment. Subject to the foregoing, investors may be able to enforce in England and Wales or Scotland judgments in civil and commercial matters that have been obtained from U.S. federal or state courts. However, we cannot assure you that those judgments will be recognised and/or enforced in England and Wales or Scotland. In addition, it is questionable whether an English or Scottish court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in England and Wales or Scotland, instead of the United States, and predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Any judgment rendered by any federal or state court in the United States based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon 525 ----- U.S. federal securities law, would not be directly enforceable in Northern Ireland. In order to enforce such a monetary judgment in Northern Ireland, under common law rules proceedings must be initiated by way of civil law action on the judgment debt before a Northern Irish Court. Summary judgment may be applied for and in this type of action, a Northern Irish court generally will not (subject to among other things, the matters identified below) reinvestigate the merits of the original matter decided by a U.S. court if: - the relevant U.S. court had territorial, procedural and substantive jurisdiction (under the UK rules of private international law applicable to Northern Ireland) to give the judgment; and - the judgment is final and conclusive on the merits and is for a definite sum of money (not being a sum payable in respect of taxes or other charges of a like nature or in respect of a fine or other penalty or otherwise based on a U.S. law that a Northern Irish Court considers to be a penal, revenue or other public law). A Northern Irish court may refuse to enforce such a judgment for reasons including if it is established that: - the enforcement of such judgment would contravene natural justice, public policy or statute in Northern Ireland; - the enforcement of the judgment is prohibited by statute (including, without limitation, if the amount of the judgment has been arrived at by doubling, trebling or otherwise multiplying a sum assessed as compensation for the loss or damage sustained); - the Northern Irish proceedings were not commenced within the relevant limitation period; - before the date on which the U.S. court gave judgment, the issues in question had been the subject of a final judgment of a Northern Irish Court or of a court of another jurisdiction whose judgment is enforceable in Northern Ireland; - the judgment has been obtained by fraud or in proceedings in which the principles of natural justice were breached; - the bringing of proceedings in the relevant U.S. court was contrary to an agreement under which the dispute in question was to be settled otherwise than by proceedings in that court (to whose jurisdiction the judgment debtor did not submit); or - an order has been made and remains effective under section 9 of the UK Foreign Judgments (Reciprocal Enforcement) Act 1933, applying that section to U.S. courts, including the relevant U.S. court. If a Northern Irish Court gives judgment for the sum payable under a U.S. judgment, the Northern Irish judgment will be enforceable by methods generally available for this purpose. In addition, it may not be possible to obtain a Northern Irish judgment or to enforce that judgment if the judgment debtor is or becomes subject to any insolvency or similar proceedings, or if the judgment debtor has any set off or counterclaim against the judgment creditor. Notwithstanding the above there can be no assurance that any judgment described will be recognised or enforceable in Northern Ireland. In addition there can be no assurance that a Northern Irish Court will accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if the original action was commenced in Northern Ireland, instead of the United States, and predicated solely on US federal securities law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.31,Note 2. Basis of preparation,215.31.1,,"The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements represent the consolidated results of the Group. These unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 'Interim Financial Reporting', as adopted by the European Union. In accordance with IAS 34, interim financial information is prepared solely in order to update the most recent annual consolidated financial statements prepared by the Group, placing emphasis on new activities, occurrences and circumstances that have taken place during the nine-month period ended 30 September 2020 and not duplicating the information previously published in the annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019. Therefore, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not include all the information that would be required in complete consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (""adopted IFRS""). In view of the above, for an adequate understanding of the information, these condensed consolidated interim financial statements must be read together with Group's consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2019 prepared in accordance with adopted IFRS and approved by the Board of Directors on 25 March 2020 (the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts). In determining the information to be disclosed in the notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements, management of the Company has, in accordance with IAS 34, taken into account the materiality of the Company and the Group in relation to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements. Unless otherwise stated, the accounting policies applied, and the judgements, estimates and assumptions made in applying these policies, are consistent with those used in preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2019. The Group financial statements are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundreds of thousands of pounds (£0.1m) except where otherwise stated. These condensed consolidated interim financial statements do not constitute statutory accounts as defined in section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. A copy of the statutory accounts for the prior financial year has been filed with the Registrar of Companies. The auditor's report on those accounts was not qualified, did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditor drew attention by way of emphasis without qualifying the report and did not contain statements under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. The Condensed Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity is presented on 31 December 2018, as previously reported, and restated as at 1 January 2019 for the application of IFRS 16 Leases (""IFRS 16""). Please refer to the 2019 Annual Report and Accounts for further detail on the first-time adoption of IFRS 16. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the period ended 30 September 2020 have been prepared on the going concern basis as the Directors have determined that the Group has sufficient resources, under current and expected future ownership (see note 15), to meet its liabilities as they fall due for a period of 18 months from the date of approval of the accounts. In assessing the Group's ability to adopt the going concern basis, the Directors have tested the ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the 18 months, following the date of approval of the accounts, in the event of various cashflow scenarios, including a severe but plausible downside scenario. This severe but plausible downside scenario considers the continued economic and social uncertainty surrounding the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and overlays a more significant decline in cashflows, including the restriction of the sale of nonessential items, than previously and currently experienced during lockdowns. A further lockdown in early Q2 2021 is also included in this scenario. Mitigating actions that are in the control of management have been considered such as reducing non-essential capex and discretionary spend. Under the new financing structure, it takes a consistent 10% reduction in sales (from the base case), over a 16 month period with no mitigating actions undertaken, in order for the Group to fully utilise all facilities available. The Directors consider the possibility of this to be remote. In making the assessment the Directors have also considered the Group's ability to meet its anticipated future financing obligations as a result of the proposed new ownership, including compliance with financial covenants, and the announced voluntary payment of business rates relating to the rates period 1 April 2020 to 31 March 2021, see note 15 for further details. ### F-6 ----- Interim Financial Statements 30 September 2020 Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements Under all scenarios modelled the Directors are comfortable that there is adequate headroom when considering both existing committed facilities under current ownership and anticipated available facilities under the expected future ownership (see note 15).

In line with the Group's reporting framework and management structure, key operating decisions are made by the Executive Board, which is considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Group and are based on revenue figures. All significant revenue is generated by the sale of goods through retail outlets in the UK and through the Group's online channels. The operations of all product areas of the business are subject to similar economic characteristics and are sold in a similar retail environment.

Walmart will retain a financial interest in the business and an ongoing commercial relationship with ASDA. _Business rates relief repayment_ In March 2020, as part of a number of measures to support business during the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government, the Scottish government and the devolved administrations for Wales and Northern Ireland announced full relief for rates charges applicable to certain eligible commercial properties for the rates year beginning in April 2020 (and in the case of Northern Ireland, such support ended after July 2020). This relief applied to a number of properties owned or leased by us and as such, no rates charge has been recognised in these accounts for the period to which this relief applied. On 3 December 2020, the group publicly announced that it would voluntarily pay rates for the 2020/21 year on the properties to which the relief applied, estimated to be £320m - £340m. As rates relief was in place at 30 September 2020, no liability existed at that date and as such, the directors have concluded that the announcement on 3 December 2020 is a non-adjusting post balance sheet event per the guidance set out in IAS 10. _Post balance sheet distribution_ The Sale & Purchase Agreement (""SPA"") agreed between and relating to the sale of the entire issued share capital of ASDA from AHUKL to BAC3L provides for ASDA being transferred on a cash-free, debt-free basis.

As such, in assessing the Group's ability to adopt the going concern basis in preparation of the Financial Statements, the Directors have considered the financial impact that COVID-19 may have on the Group's operating cashflows in the foreseeable future based on data available at the date of approval. Specifically as part of this assessment, the Directors have tested the ability of the Group to meet its liabilities as they fall due in the 12 months following the date of approval in the event of various cashflow scenarios, including a severe downside reduction in revenue – based on independent estimates of the range of forecast impacts on UK GDP – versus expected revenue for the 12 months following the date of approval. Based on the range of cashflow forecasts modelled, and considering the Group's financial position at the date of approval of the Accounts along with the Group's access to borrowing facilities via the ultimate parent company or an alternative lender as required, the Directors have adopted the going concern basis in preparation of the Financial Statements. Factors specifically considered which support this conclusion include a balanced assessment of the principal financial impacts which the Directors expect to impact the Group in the 12 month period following the date of approval of the Accounts: Expected net increase in demand for groceries purchased through retail outlets during the period of national disruption given restrictions in place on customers' ability to purchase food from non-retail outlets such as restaurants; The Group's ability to fulfil demand for groceries through a variety of fulfilment channels, including a significant online presence through ASDA.com; Impacts on product availability of significant short-term increases in customer demand for certain everyday essential products; Incremental costs related to a significant expected increase in colleague absence; Expected cost savings in the 12 month period following the date of approval of the accounts due primarily to UK government support announced prior to the date of approval of the accounts to provide financial support to retailers; and, The ability of the Group to access significant short-term borrowing facilities via the ultimate parent company or an alternative lender as required in the event of short-term liquidity issues.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The standard applies to all revenue contracts and provides a model for the recognition and measurement of sales of some non-financial assets (e.g. disposals of property, plant and equipment). The core principle of IFRS 15 is that revenue is recognised to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has assessed the impact of these changes and concluded that there is a net impact of £3.4m relating to deferred revenue on gift cards. This relates to accelerated revenue recognition of breakage previously deferred for a fixed period after the initial gift card sale which is now recognised at point of sale. This has been accounted for as a prior year adjustment as shown in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. The adjustments arising out of the application of IFRS 15 at 1 January 2017 are as follows: trade and other payables (£4.1m decrease); deferred tax assets (£0.7m decrease) and retained earnings (£3.4m increase). The impacts at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018 are in line with the impacts at 1 January 2017 and prior year balance sheet amounts have been restated accordingly.

IFRS 9 includes revised guidance on the classification and measurement of financial instruments, including the new expected credit loss (""ECL"") model for calculating impairment of financial assets, and the new general hedge accounting requirements. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has assessed the requirements of IFRS 9 on the carrying value of financial assets, the classification of financial assets and the application of hedge accounting and has concluded that there is no material impact on the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2018, 31 December 2017 or 1 January 2017. In respect of the ECL model for determining whether financial assets are impaired, management has conducted a review of all material intercompany receivables and determined that each significant counterparty is demonstrably able to settle its liabilities to the Group on demand and in full at 31 December 2018, 31 December 2017 and 1 January 2017. Therefore the probability of default is nil and no impairment charge has been recorded at 31 December 2018, 31 December 2017 or 1 January 2017. In relation to trade receivables, due to the short lead times between recognition and settlement of these balances, management has applied the simplified approach in adopting IFRS 9 and determined that there is no impact on the carrying value of trade receivables at 31 December 2018, 31 December 2017 or 1 January 2017 resulting from the adoption of IFRS 9.

This replaces IAS 17 'Leases' and IFRIC 4 'Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease'. IFRS 16 introduces new or amended requirements with respect to lease accounting. It introduces significant changes to lessee accounting by removing the distinction between operating and finance lease and requiring the recognition of a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at commencement for all leases, except for short-term leases and leases of low value assets when such recognition exemptions are adopted. In contrast to lessee accounting, the requirements for lessor accounting have remained largely unchanged. The date of initial application of IFRS 16 for the Group is 1 January 2019. _Impact on lessee accounting_ IFRS 16 changes how the Group accounts for leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17, which were recorded off-Balance Sheet. Applying IFRS 16, for all leases (except as noted below), the Group: a) recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, initially measured at the present value of the future lease payments, with the right-of-use asset adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the Balance Sheet immediately before the date of transition. b) recognises depreciation of right-of-use assets and interest on lease liabilities in the Consolidated Income Statement. Lease incentives (e.g. rent free periods) are recognised as part of the measurement of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities whereas under IAS 17 they resulted in the recognition of a lease incentive accrual, amortised as a reduction of rental expenses on a straight line basis. Under IFRS 16, right-of-use assets are tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. For leases that were classified as finance leases before the transition date, the carrying amount of these leases has been reclassified to right-of-use assets and lease liabilities respectively. _Impact on lessor accounting_ IFRS 16 does not change substantially how a lessor accounts for leases. Under IFRS 16, a lessor continues to classify leases as either finance leases or operating leases and account for those two types of leases differently. Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the classification under IFRS 16 is required to be made with reference to the right-of-use asset that arises under the headlease. On transition to IFRS 16, there has been no change to how leases where the Group is a head or intermediate lessor are accounted for. ### F-24 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Leases for which the Group is a lessor are classified as finance or operating leases. Whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee, the contract is classified as a finance lease. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Where the Group is an intermediate lessor, the head lease and sub-lease are accounted for as two separate contracts and assessment of classification is made with reference to the right-of-use asset resulting from the head lease rather than the underlying asset. The Group currently has no leases classified as finance where it is the lessor. Where the Group owns the freehold, assets are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic lives. Rental income from operating leases, including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Third party lessees are subject to credit checks prior to entering into a lease contract with the Group and may be required to provide a guarantor depending on the outcome of these checks. Additionally, some leases contain clauses enabling upwards revision of the rental charge according to prevailing market condition at points within the lease contracts.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

This has been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2019 by assessing the present value of forecasted cash savings arising from the synergies achieved as a result of the acquisition. Goodwill is allocated to a single cash-generating unit, being the acquired sourcing company. The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cashflow projections from financial budgets approved by senior management covering a five-year period. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cashflow projections is 8.4% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the cashflows beyond specific forecast period is 0.0%. The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the assumptions of growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial forecast period and the discount rate.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
1162_5,Preliminary Offerings 2021.md,215,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS,215.85,Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2019 (continued),215.85.4,Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities,"The Group's principal financial instruments during the year comprised cash, cash equivalents, intercompany payables and receivables, derivatives classified as hedges and lease liabilities. Other financial assets and liabilities, such as trade receivables, other receivables, trade payables, other payables, and accruals arise directly from the Group's operating activities. The difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the Group's financial instruments is not material. The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: _Fixed rate borrowings – the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted_ cash flow using appropriate interest rates to net present value. _Derivatives – derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of forward contracts_ entered into and are split between in the money (assets) and out of the money (liabilities). At 31 December 2019 the Group held £3.1m (2018: £41.0m) in the money assets, and £19.1m (2018: £0.6m) out of the money liabilities in respect of its forward contracts. During the year, the Group recognised liabilities on revaluation of hedged monetary assets and liabilities from historical cost to year-end spot rate of £5.4m (2018: £7.4m asset). The fair values of the Group's financial derivatives and fixed rate borrowings with fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate parent company have been calculated at observable unquoted interest rates, and are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement'. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. _Financial risk management_ The Treasury function manages the Group's financial risk, considering its borrowings and exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Group finances its operations through intercompany borrowings which were issued a number of years ago and are wholly held within the Walmart Inc. group. The Group utilises its cash balances, and has access to bank overdrafts, to satisfy short-term cash flow requirements. Foreign currency exposure is managed through entering into forward currency contracts. _Interest rate risk_ The Group's short-term borrowings are all held with entities which are part of the Walmart Inc. group and are at fixed rates of interest. Amounts owed to fellow subsidiaries (note 24) attract interest at a rate of 5.448% – 6% (2018: 5.448 – 6%). As interest rates are fixed on all of the Group's debt, interest rate movements would not have an impact on profitability, cash flow or equity. ### F-58 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

IFRS 16 allows for certain transition and accounting policy options for companies taking the modified retrospective approach. The Group has applied the following practical expedients at transition date, but no others: To rely on the previous identification of a lease (as provided by IAS 17 or IFRIC 4) for all contracts that existed on the transition date; and, To exclude initial direct costs other than those arising from lease buy-outs (see note 11) from the measurement of the right-of-use asset on the transition date. With respect to all leases previously classified as operating under IAS 17, the Group has elected to measure rightof-use assets recognised on the transition date at an amount equal to the lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognised in the Balance Sheet immediately before the transition date. The Group has taken the following ongoing policy choices from the adoption date: To account for any lease with a term of less than 12 months as a short term lease, recognising cost in the Income Statement on a straight line basis over the lease term and not recognising a right-of-use asset and lease liability at the contract date; To apply the IFRS 16 low value asset exemption threshold based on the value of the asset when new, on an individual asset basis if deemed appropriate; To apply a materiality threshold to all leases on and post transition. Costs relating to leases with total undiscounted cash flows over the life of the lease below a documented threshold will be expensed as incurred and no right-of-use asset or lease liability will be recognised at the contract date; To elect to combine lease and non-lease components prospectively after the transition date. This applies to all leases with the exception of IT and printer leases. _Financial impact of adoption_ In the year of adoption, the overall impact to the Income Statement was a decrease in profit before tax of £21.3m, split as a decrease to operating costs of £31.4m and an increase to finance costs of £52.7m. ### F-25 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019 The table on the following page illustrates the impacts to the Balance Sheet at the transition date. 7) Amounts previously provided for onerous leases. On transition these leases have been deemed impaired and these balances therefore included in the related lease right-of-use asset. The following reconciliation presents the differences between liabilities carried forward at 31 December 2018 under IAS 17 and liabilities brought forward at 1 January 2019 under IFRS 16: Annual supplier rebates – typically these are earned and billed within the financial year of the Group. A small proportion of rebate agreements may extend beyond the year-end and in these cases, estimations may be required of projected sales volumes and judgement may also need to be applied to determine the rebate level earned if agreements involve multiple tiers. All income accruals are supported by detailed calculations, based on the explicit terms in each agreement and judgements are minimal, due to the small number of agreements spanning the year-end. Fixed amount supplier income – the majority of this income is earned and billed within the financial year of the Group. A small proportion of agreements may not be coterminous with the year-end and, in these cases, any income accrued is supported by detailed calculations. These require judgement to determine when the terms of the agreement are satisfied and that amounts are recognised in the correct period. Supplier income recognised in the Income Statement and accounted for within trade receivables (note 13) at the year-end for which estimation and judgement is required is £2.0m (2018: £0.6m). This represents the net amount of accrued income (£2.0m) (2018: £0.6m) and deferred income (£nil) (2018: £nil) on deals running across the yearend. _IFRS 16 lease term_ IFRS 16 defines the lease term as the non-cancellable period of a lease together with the period covered by options to extend the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the option, and the period covered by an option to terminate the lease if the lessee is reasonably certain not to exercise the option. The Group applies judgement to whether an extension should be added to the non-cancellable lease term with reference to the following: Extension options in the contract. Consideration as to whether any option is reasonably certain to be exercised is based on whether an economic incentive exists to do so. This incentive is assessed by reference to multiple factors including but not limited to current operational performance of the site and future performance projections, length of time to the option exercise date and future capital requirements. The majority of the Group's leases do not have extension options in the contract but, where they do, most lease terms include the extension period. Geographical factors. A term extension on any lease for sites in England and Wales may be judged reasonably certain on the basis of security of tenure if an economic incentive to remain in the lease beyond the contractual term is deemed to exist. This incentive is assessed by reference to the same factors listed above. If an extension is judged reasonably certain, the typical additional term applied is 10 years. Geographical factors are not considered for sites outside England and Wales. In the event of changing circumstances or new information that may impact judgements taken, lease terms will be re-assessed on a lease by lease basis. A quarterly review is performed to identify where re-assessments may be required. Any change in lease term could result in a recalculation of the lease liability and a material adjustment to the associated right-of-use asset. There are no examples of term reassessment in 2019. _Other_ The insurance provision (note 18) relates to liabilities arising from past events which are not covered by third party insurance. This includes both known and potential claims from stores and depots. Estimates are made with regards to determining the provision required either by actuarial assessment or based on historical experience. ### F-28 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019 Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance with IAS 37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters are made in contingent liabilities (note 23). Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be classified as trade payables or financing. In determining the classification, the Group reviews each arrangement against a number of characteristics and the legal form of the arrangement is considered. All balances under supply chain financing arrangements are currently treated as trade payables. _Share-based payment transactions_ The Group estimates fair value for share-based payment transactions depending on the terms and conditions of the grants. This estimate also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including assumptions of the expected life of the share option, share price, volatility and dividend yield. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 17. _Pension Buy-in_ Judgement has been applied in accounting for the buy-in of the defined benefit ASDA Group Pension Scheme (""the Scheme"") during the year. As the Group retains an obligation to fund pension liabilities of the Scheme in the event of insurer default, the buy-in does not meet the criteria of a settlement event as set out in IAS 19 – Employee Benefits. As such, the actuarial loss associated with the buy-in has been recognised in other comprehensive income. Further detail is provided in note 17. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition date fair value can be measured reliably. If the aggregate of the acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference is measured in profit and loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit, or group of units, to which goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation. Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. The Group re-measures the lease liability (and makes a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset) whenever: The lease term has changed or there is a significant event or change in circumstances resulting in a change in the assessment of exercise of a purchase option, in which case the lease liability is re-measured by discounting the revised lease payments using the current discount rate; The lease payments change due to changes in an index or rate or a change in expected payment under a guaranteed residual value, in which cases the lease liability is remeasured by discounting the revised lease payments using an unchanged discount rate; or, A lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease, in which case the lease liability is re-measured based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification. _Discount rate_ When discounting payments to present value, the Group uses the interest rate implicit in the lease if this rate can be readily determined. For a small volume of high value leases, the rate implicit in the lease can be calculated and has therefore been used. Otherwise, for the majority of leases the rate used is based on an estimated incremental borrowing rate. Rates are determined with reference to UK rates available to the Group adjusted for lease term. Rates are updated on a quarterly basis. _Right-of-use Assets_ Right-of-use assets comprise the initial measurement of the corresponding lease liability, lease payments made at or before the commencement day (including lease buy out payments made to previous tenants) less any lease incentives received and any initial direct costs. They are subsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses. Right-of-use assets are depreciated over the lease term. If a lease transfers ownership of the underlying asset or the cost of the right-of-use asset reflects that the Group expects to exercise a purchase option, the related right-ofuse asset is depreciated over the useful life of the underlying asset. Depreciation is charged from the commencement date of the lease. Right-of-use assets are presented as a separate line in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Group applies IAS 36 to determine whether a right-of-use asset is impaired and accounts for any identified impairment loss as described in the 'Impairment' policy above. _Non-lease components and variable rent expense_ As a practical expedient, IFRS 16 permits a lessee not to separate non-lease components, and instead account for any lease and associated non-lease components as a single arrangement. The Group has taken this election with ### F-34 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019 the exception of IT and printer leases where other charges included in the contract (maintenance and replenishment) are accounted for separately within related cost lines. The primary non-lease components recognised within lease payments are property costs (service charges and insurances) paid to landlords and included within the terms of lease contracts. These costs are included within the lease payments at commencement date if fixed, or within variable rent expense as incurred if not. The majority of these payments are variable and therefore not included in the lease liability. As a lessee, the Group does not have any rent payment terms linked to sales or other variable metrics. All financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. The Group assesses financial assets for impairment using the expected credit losses model and recognises impairment losses as required. _Loans and receivables_ The Group's loans and receivables, including amounts owed by fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate parent company, are held with the sole objective of collecting contractual cash flows and are therefore carried at amortised cost. They are included in current assets except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the Balance Sheet date. _Interest-bearing loans and borrowings_ Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or losses arising on repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income or finance cost. _Offsetting of financial instruments_ Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the Balance Sheet only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. _Fair values_ Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm'slength transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. _Derivative financial instruments and hedging_ Derivative financial instruments (""derivatives"") are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Derivatives are stated at their fair value. The fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts is their market value at the Balance Sheet date. Market values are calculated using mathematical models and are based on the duration of derivative together with quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market volatility at the Balance Sheet date. For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. ### F-36 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019 All of the Group's hedges are considered to be cash flow hedges, hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly as other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion would be recognised in profit and loss. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Income Statement, within cost of inventories recognised as an expense, when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast purchase occurs. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to profit and loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the Income Statement, within cost of inventories recognised as an expense. The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments. Refer to note 16 for further details. in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. The amount of deferred tax provided is measured on an undiscounted basis based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the Balance Sheet date. discounted to determine its present value, and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The financing costs of the scheme are recognised in the period in which they arise. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the Statement of Other Comprehensive Income in the period in which they occur. In the prior year, the Group was subject to minimum funding requirements in the UK and did not have an unconditional right to a refund of a surplus. This resulted in an obligation which was recognised as an additional liability and a reduction to other comprehensive income. As described in note 17, a buy-in of the ASDA Group Pension Scheme (""the Scheme"") was executed during the year. Other than estimated contributions in respect of the buy-in loan described below, the probability of the Group having to make further contributions to the Scheme in the future in respect of pension liabilities is deemed to be remote. As such, the liability relating to the minimum funding obligation has been released in full with a corresponding gain being recognised in other comprehensive income. contractual periods may extend over the Group's year end. In such cases the amount of any income accrued in relation to these agreements is supported by detailed calculations. Supplier income is split into three classifications: Supplier incentives and discounts – which are usually expressed in the supplier agreement as an agreed amount per item sold. This type of supplier income is mechanically calculated and therefore no judgement is required in determining the amount of income to record in the financial year; Annual supplier rebates – these are earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases. The rebates are linked to pre-agreed volumes of sales or purchases of specific products and are supported by explicit contractual terms; and, Fixed amount supplier income – this is earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases. Fixed monetary amounts are agreed with suppliers relating to certain promotional activities including, for example, new product listings, increased product distribution or specific promotional events. Unbilled amounts of income to which the Group is contractually entitled are included in trade and other receivables, or offset against corresponding trade payables, however these amounts are not considered material. Billed amounts unpaid at year-end are included in trade receivables or offset against corresponding trade payables where a contractual right of offset exists. In line with the Group's reporting framework and management structure, key operating decisions are made by the Executive Board which is considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker for the Group. All significant revenue is generated by the sale of goods through retail outlets in the UK and through the Group's online channels. The operations of all product areas of the business are subject to similar economic characteristics and are sold in a similar retail environment. The Group has taken these factors into account together with the core principles of IFRS 8 in determining that it has a single reportable operating segment. The analysis of the Group's revenue for the year from continuing operations is as follows: A reconciliation of the total tax charge compared to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19% (2018: 19%) applied to the profit on ordinary activities before tax is as follows: Deferred tax movement during the prior year: The Group has not made any provision for intercompany receivables. (£133.5m of capital payments and £49.0m of interest payments). The non-cash impact of recognising liabilities relating to new leases entered into during the year accounts for the remaining increase. Intercompany Payables: The net increase in intercompany payables of £135.7m is attributable to interest charged on intercompany payables during the year of £179.1m (see note 24 for details) partially offset by payments made during the year of £43.4m, including interest paid of £31.4m. The Group does not expect to take out borrowings with a variable interest rate in the foreseeable future. _Foreign currency risk_ The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are managed through the use of forward contracts. The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31 December 2019, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases. The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a period of more than 12 months after the 31 December 2019. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the Income Statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2019, a net unrealised loss of £11.8m (2018: £29.6m gain) was included in the hedge reserve in respect of hedging contracts. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of these hedging contracts was £41.4m (2018: £50.6m gain). This consists of £38.0m of gains reclassified to the Income Statement during the year (2018: £24.2m of losses), a £12.9m loss on not-yet-matured contracts during the year (2018: £38.3m gain), and a £9.5m taxation credit (2018: £11.9m charge). Under the Group's hedging policy, the only items for which forward currency contracts are in place are forecast purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 95% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the Income Statement upon maturity of the forward contract. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash flows would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the year (2018: none), therefore amounts recognised in the Income Statement in relation to ineffective hedges is £nil (2018: £nil). As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure through the use of forward currency contracts, changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short-term profitability or cash flow. It is anticipated that a 5% movement in the US Dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management's assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of £29.7m (2018: £36.6m). _Credit risk_ There is no significant credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is included in their carrying value as at the Balance Sheet date. See note 13 for further information on trade receivables and details of recoverability. The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default in relation to trade receivables including detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted. Historically, these procedures have proved effective in minimising the level of impaired and past due receivables. ### F-59 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019 Surplus cash is placed on short-term deposit with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Group Treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit. Deposit limits and approved financial institutions are dictated by the investment policy of the ultimate parent company. Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses model under IFRS 9 and no impairment is required. _Liquidity risk_ The Group's Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring rolling forecasts of the Group's cash flows. The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At 31 December 2019 the Group had no external borrowings, other than lease liabilities. As at 31 December 2019, the Group held cash of £1,929.3m (2018: £2,916.1m), utilised along with overdrafts where necessary, to secure short-term flexibility. At 31 December 2019, the Group had committed overdraft facilities of £30.0m (2018: £30.0m), standby credit facilities, including bonds of £96.7m (2018: £112.1m), and committed line of credit facilities of £30.0m (2018: £125.0m). The Group also has access to a facility which is available to other subsidiaries of the ultimate parent, the limit of which depends on the usage by fellow subsidiaries. The following table summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments. The disclosed financial derivative instruments are the gross undiscounted cash flows. However, these amounts may be settled gross or net. to capital management during the year. Full details of the Group's approach to capital management and how the Group define capital is provided in the Strategic Report. Full details of the amount of intercompany loans payable or receivable to and from the Walmart Inc. group of companies are disclosed in note 24. The range of exercise price in the year was £38.64 to £65.81 (2018: £39.88 to £67.93) The fair value of the options outstanding under the WSIP scheme at 31 December 2019 is £0.2m (2018: £0.4m). _Restricted Stock Rights (RSR) scheme_ The RSR scheme was introduced in 2008 as an alternative to the WSIP scheme. Under the RSR scheme, employees are awarded the right to receive a predetermined number of shares in the ultimate parent company two or three years from the award date. All RSRs are classed as unapproved from an Income Tax and National Insurance perspective. RSR awards are treated as cash-settled. The number of share awards under the RSR scheme is as follows: The fair value of the options outstanding under the PSP scheme at 31 December 2019 is £8.3m (2018: £12.0m). The fair value of share options is measured using a Black-Scholes model taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the instruments were granted. The following table gives the weighted average assumptions applied to the options granted during the year and are outstanding in the respective periods shown. The other property provision represents amounts in respect of future rental relating to leases which, per guidance in IAS 17, were classified as onerous. On 1 January 2019, the Group adopted IFRS 16 – Leases, as described in note 1. On transition, this provision has been reclassified to right-of-use assets. _Amounts recognised in Income Statement_ The following table shows the breakdown of the lease expense between amounts charged to operating profit and amounts charged to finance costs: The next smallest group at which consolidated financial statements are prepared is Broadstreet Great Wilson Europe Limited. Copies of these financial statements are available for inspection at its registered office: ASDA House, South Bank, Great Wilson Street, Leeds, LS11 5AD.

Judgements, estimates and assumptions are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and various other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The key estimates and assumptions impacting the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed further below. _Impairment of goodwill and brand licence intangible_ The Group has significant carrying value of goodwill and brand related intangible assets held within intangible assets on the balance sheet. An impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions in arm's-length transactions of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from management forecasts for the next five years, with reference to the Board approved budget for the next three years. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the sales growth, operating costs, growth rate for extrapolated cash flows and the discount rate. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount, including a sensitivity analysis, are further explained in note 10. ### F-89 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent from those of other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time-value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses on continuing operations are recognised in the Income Statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units (""CGU"") are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and second, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets.

For these leases, the Group recognises the lease payments as an operating expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased assets are consumed. _Lease liability_ The lease liability is initially measured at the value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date, discounted to present value.

All supplier income is supported by agreements and, in the majority of instances, these agreements begin and end within the Group's financial year. In a small number of instances, contractual periods may extend over the Group's year end. In such cases the amount of any income accrued in relation to these agreements is supported by detailed calculations. Supplier income is split into three classifications: Supplier incentives and discounts – which are usually expressed in the supplier agreement as an agreed amount per item sold. This type of supplier income is mechanically calculated and therefore no judgement is required in determining the amount of income to record in the financial year; Annual supplier rebates – these are earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases. The rebates are linked to pre-agreed volumes of sales or purchases of specific products and are supported by explicit contractual terms. Fixed amount supplier income – this is earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases. Fixed monetary amounts are agreed with suppliers relating to certain promotional activities including, for example, new product listings, increased product distribution or specific promotional events. ### F-99 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the outstanding obligation so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Assets are depreciated over the term of the lease. _Operating leases_ Rental payments are expensed to the Income Statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.

This has been tested for impairment as at 31 December 2019 by allocating costs directly attributable to Netto stores and a reasonable allocation of central costs, to the chain of converted Netto stores along with other related assets. This represents the lowest level to which management monitors goodwill. The recoverable amount is determined based on a value in use calculation using cash flow projections from financial budgets approved by senior management covering a five-year period. This is the period to which specific reliable forecasts have been made. The pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8.4% and the growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the specific forecast period is 0.6%. The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the assumptions of sales growth, gross margin, operating costs, growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the initial forecast period, and the discount rate.

The AGPS was subject to a buy-in transaction (""the buy-in"") on 17 October 2019 through the purchase of a bulk purchase annuity (""BPA"") policy with the insurer Rothesay Life PLC, under which the benefits payable to all AGPS pensioners and deferred members have become fully insured. In order to enable the AGPS to execute the buy-in, the Group made a contribution to the AGPS of £707.5m and advanced a loan to the scheme with a book value of £467.3m (""the buy-in loan""). Interest is charged at an armslength rate on this loan. A pre-tax loss of £1,175.8m has been recognised in other comprehensive income in relation to the buy-in representing the difference between the cost of the BPA and the accounting value of the liabilities insured. Prior to the buy-in, the Group was obliged to fund the deficit on the AGPS on a secondary funding objective basis by April 2032 under a schedule of contributions for which the Group was liable. A liability was recognised in previous years in relation to this obligation, known as a minimum funding requirement (""MFR""), under guidance set out in IFRIC 14. Other than additional contributions under a back-to-back agreement with the Scheme which are described below, following the buy-in, the probability of the Group being required to make future contributions to the AGPS in respect of pension liabilities is considered remote and as such the MFR liability has been released in full during the year, with a corresponding pre-tax gain of £1,051.9m being recognised in other comprehensive income. The Scheme has repaid £39.5m of the pre buy-in loan during the year and as such, the outstanding balance on the buy-in loan at 31 December 2019 was £427.8m. The Scheme has retained ownership of various assets, including illiquid investments and cash, some of which will be required to meet ongoing expenses incurred by the Scheme and the remainder of which the Scheme intends to liquidate to repay the buy-in loan. To the extent that the Scheme is unable to settle the loan balance in full out of the proceeds realised through the liquidation of these assets, the Group is contractually obliged under a back-to-back agreement to make a contribution to the Scheme to the value of the shortfall between the assets in the Scheme and the outstanding balance on the buy-in loan. Based on the fair value of Scheme assets at 31 December 2019, and a forecast of the ongoing expenses to be incurred by the Scheme, total expected contributions under the back-to-back agreement are expected to be £119.6m and this amount has been included in operating cashflow in addition to the initial contribution of £707.5m – a total of £827.1m. As the illiquid assets and cash are held within the Scheme as a separate legal entity from the Group, and could be used to settle pension liabilities in the event of a shortfall from the BPA, they meet the definition of pension assets under IAS 19 – Employee Benefits. As such, the difference between fair value of Scheme assets at 31 December 2019 and the book value of the buy-in loan at that date has been accounted for as an actuarial loss in other comprehensive income and is included in the buy-in loss amount of £1,175.8m. The Group remains liable for pension benefits payable to members of the UURBS and these liabilities with a fair value at 31 December 2019 of £14.0m (2018: £11.0m) are accounted for in line with IAS 19. This amount is included in the Scheme liabilities set out in the table below. ### F-62 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2019",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The above sensitivity analyses are based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the Balance Sheet. These sensitivities exclude the impact of the onerous liability recorded in the prior year, which has been released in full during the year as described earlier in this note.

The Group is using a modified retrospective approach and has elected to measure lease assets at an amount based on the lease liability. The Group is applying the short term lease exemption and will recognise rental expense relating to short term leases directly to the income statement. The Group has reviewed all leases and assessed the impact to the financial statements. The change will have a significant impact on the Group's balance sheet, specifically a material increase to assets and liabilities. It will also materially impact the presentation within the income statement as operating profit will increase and finance costs will increase.

Accounting for the amount and timing of recognition of certain elements of supplier income may require the exercise of judgement. The three key types of supplier income are explained in the accounting policy on page 33. The areas requiring a level of judgement and estimation involved are considered below: Annual supplier rebates – typically these are earned and billed within the financial year of the Group. A small proportion of rebate agreements may extend beyond the year end and in these cases estimations may be required of projected sales volumes and judgement may also need to be applied to determine the rebate level earned if agreements involve multiple tiers. All income accruals are supported by detailed calculations, based on the explicit terms in each agreement and judgements are minimal, due to the small number of agreements spanning the year end. Fixed amount supplier income – the majority of this income is earned and billed within the financial year of the Group. A small proportion of agreements may not be coterminous with the year end and, in these cases, any income accrued is supported by detailed calculations. These require judgement to determine when the terms of the agreement are satisfied and that amounts are recognised in the correct period. Supplier income recognised in the income statement and accounted for as an offset within trade payables (note 15) at the year-end for which estimation and judgement is required is £0.6m (2017: £0.6m). This represents the net amount of accrued income (£0.6m) (2017: £0.6m) and deferred income (£nil) (2017: £nil) on deals running across the year end. _Intercompany royalty expense_ The Group incurs a royalty charge from the ultimate parent company. The calculation of this is based on the return on investment of the Group and the operating profit of a subsidiary undertaking within the Group. The calculation for the years ended 31 December 2018, 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 is under review with the UK and US tax authorities and the royalty paid in those years has been calculated on the basis agreed for the year ended 31 December 2015. This amount constitutes the majority of the Walmart Inc. recharge disclosed in note 24. _Other_ The insurance provision (note 18) relates to liabilities arising from past events which are not covered by third party insurance. This includes both known and potential claims from stores and depots. Estimates are made with regards to determining the provision required either by actuarial assessment or based on historical experience. Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance with IAS 37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters are made in contingent liabilities (note 23). Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be classified as trade payables or financing. In determining the classification, the Group reviews each arrangement against a number of characteristics and the legal form of the arrangement is considered. All balances under supply chain financing arrangements are treated as trade payables. ### F-90 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018 _Pension benefits_ The carrying value of the liabilities relating to the defined benefit pension scheme is determined using an actuarial valuation. This valuation is based on assumptions. All the assumptions used are estimates of future events. Further details about the key assumptions used are given in note 17. _Share-based payment transactions_ The Group estimates fair value for share-based payment transactions depending on the terms and conditions of the grants. This estimate also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including assumptions of the expected life of the share option, share price, volatility and dividend yield. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 17. _Finance versus operating lease classification_ In assessing whether a lease is finance or operating in nature, assumptions and estimates need to be made including determination of the implicit interest rate, fair values of properties and the split of land and building elements of property lease contracts. Market data is used to determine these assumptions. goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition-date fair value can be measured reliably. If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference is measured in profit and loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit, or group of units, to which goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation. Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. _Finance leases_ Assets acquired by way of a finance lease are recognised at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value and the present value, calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease, of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease with a corresponding liability as an obligation to pay future rentals. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the outstanding obligation so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Assets are depreciated over the term of the lease. _Operating leases_ Rental payments are expensed to the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term. Leases that contain predetermined fixed rental increases are accounted for such that the increases are recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement over the lease term. Prepaid operating lease rentals are recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. _Group as a lessor_ Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic lives. Rental income, including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. _Interest bearing loans and borrowings_ Interest bearing loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains or losses arising on repurchase, settlement or cancellation of liabilities are recognised respectively in finance income or finance cost. _Offsetting of financial instruments_ Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. _Fair values_ Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm'slength transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. _Derivative financial instruments and hedging_ Derivative financial instruments (""derivatives"") are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Derivatives are stated at their fair value. The fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts is their market value at the balance sheet date. Market values are calculated using mathematical models and are based on the duration of derivative together with quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market volatility at the balance sheet date. For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. All of the Group's hedges are considered to be cash flow hedges, hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly as other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion would be recognised in profit and loss. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement, within cost of inventories recognised as an expense, when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast purchase occurs. ### F-96 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018 If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to profit and loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement, within cost of inventories recognised as an expense. The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecast transactions and firm commitments. Refer to note 16 for further details. Unbilled amounts of income to which the Group is contractually entitled are included in trade and other receivables, or offset against corresponding trade payables, however these amounts are not considered material. Billed amounts unpaid at year end are included in trade receivables or offset against corresponding trade payables where a contractual right of offset exists. The analysis of the Group's revenue for the year from continuing operations is as follows: Amounts in respect of the highest paid director are as follows: A reconciliation of the total tax charge compared to the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 19.00% (2017: 19.25%) applied to the profit on ordinary activities before tax is as follows: Deferred tax movement during the prior year: During the prior year, assets relating to lease buy outs were reclassified from leasehold improvements to intangible assets to better reflect the nature of these items. Assets transferred had a gross cost of £6.3m and accumulated depreciation of £1.4m (see note 9). The Group considers its trade and other receivables in default when contractual payments are 90 days past due. However, in certain cases, the Group may also consider a trade or other receivable to be in default when internal or external information indicates that the Group is unlikely to receive the outstanding contractual amounts in full before taking into account any credit enhancements held by the Group. A trade or other receivable is written off when there is no reasonable expectation of recovering the contractual cash flows. As at 31 December 2018, trade receivables at nominal value of £3.9m (2017: £3.9m) were impaired and fully provided for. Movements in the allowance for expected credit losses in the year were as follows: _Fixed rate borrowings – the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted_ cash flow using appropriate interest rates to net present value. All fixed rate borrowings are held with fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate parent company and included within intercompany payables. _Derivatives – derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of forward contracts_ entered into and are split between in the money (assets) and out of the money (liabilities). At 31 December 2018 the Group held £41.0m (2017: £nil) in the money assets, and £0.6m (2017: £29.4m) out of the money liabilities in respect of its forward contracts. During the year, the Group recognised losses on revaluation of hedged monetary liabilities from historical cost to year-end spot rate of £7.4m (2017: £22.6m loss). The fair values of the Group's financial derivatives and fixed rate borrowings with fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate parent company have been calculated at observable unquoted interest rates, and are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement'. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. _Financial risk management_ The Treasury function manages the Group's financial risk, considering its borrowings and exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Group finances its operations through intercompany borrowings which were issued a number of years ago and are wholly held within the Walmart Inc. group. The Group utilises its cash balances, and has access to bank overdrafts, to satisfy short-term cash flow requirements. Foreign currency exposure is managed through entering into forward currency contracts. _Interest rate risk_ The Group's short term borrowings are all held with entities which are part of the Walmart Inc. group and are at fixed rates of interest. Amounts owed to fellow subsidiaries (note 24) attract interest at a rate of 5.448% – 6% (2017: 5.448-6%). As interest rates are fixed on all of the Group's debt, interest rate movements would not have an impact on profitability, cash flow or equity. The Group does not expect to take out borrowings with a variable interest rate in the foreseeable future. _Foreign currency risk_ The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are managed through the use of forward contracts. The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31 December 2018, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases. The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a period of more than 12 months after 31 December 2018. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2018, a net unrealised gain of £29.6m (2017: £21.0m loss) was included in the hedging reserve in respect of hedging contracts. The net gain recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of these hedging contracts was £50.6m (2017: £57.8m loss). This consists of a £24.2m loss reclassified to the Income ### F-114 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018 Statement during the year (2017: £35.9m gain), a £38.3m gain on not-yet-matured contracts during the year (2017: £34.4m loss), and a £11.9m taxation charge (2017: £12.5m credit). Under the Group's hedging policy, the only items for which forward currency contracts are in place are forecast purchases of goods for resale. The Group hedges up to 95% of forecast cash flows. Gains and losses attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the income statement upon maturity of the forward contract. Forward contracts entered into which are not in line with forecast cash flows would be the principal source of hedge ineffectiveness. No instances of this have occurred during the year (2017: none), therefore amounts recognised in the income statement in relation to ineffective hedges is £nil (2017: £nil). As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure through the use of forward currency contracts, changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short term profitability or cash flow. It is anticipated that a 5% movement in the US dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management's assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in the cash flow hedge reserve of £36.6m (2017: £42.1m). _Credit risk_ There is no significant credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is included in their carrying value as at the balance sheet date. See note 13 for further information on trade receivables and details of recoverability. The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default by trade debtors including detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted. Historically, these procedures have proved effective in minimising the level of impaired and past due debtors. Surplus cash is placed on short term deposit with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Group treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit. Deposit limits and approved financial institutions are dictated by the investment policy of the ultimate parent company. Intercompany receivables have been considered in relation to the expected credit losses model under IFRS 9 and no impairment is required. _Liquidity risk_ The Group's Treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring rolling forecasts of the Group's cash flows. The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At 31 December 2018 the Group had no external borrowings. As at 31 December 2018, the Group held cash of £2,916.1m (2017: £2,171.7m), utilised along with overdrafts where necessary, to secure short term flexibility. At 31 December 2018, the Group had committed overdraft facilities of £30.0m (2017: £30.0m), standby credit facilities, including bonds of £112.1m (2017: £112.9m), and committed line of credit facilities of £125.0m (2017: £125.0m). The Group also has use of a facility which is available to other subsidiaries of the ultimate parent, the limit of which depends on the usage by fellow subsidiaries. ### F-115 ----- ### Reports and Financial Statements 31 December 2018 The following table summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments. The disclosed financial derivative instruments are the gross undiscounted cash flows. However, these amounts may be settled gross or net. Responsibility for governance of the plans – including investment decisions and contribution schedules – lies with two corporate trustee companies. The Board of the defined benefit plan corporate trustee company is made up of nine trustees: five of these are member nominated trustees including two pensioners, two are company appointed, and there are two professional independent trustees. The Board of the defined contribution plan corporate trustee company is made up of seven trustees: three of these are member nominated, three are company appointed, and there is one professional independent trustee. The Group's ultimate parent company Walmart Inc., guarantees the Group's obligations to the funded defined benefit plan up to a maximum amount of £980.0m. This guarantee has no time limit. A schedule of contributions is in place between the Group and Trustee of the funded defined benefit plan in order to pay down the deficit on a secondary funding objective basis. The current schedule was agreed in 2017. A long term funding agreement was entered into in 2015 whereby contributions will continue until the scheme is fully funded on a self-sufficiency basis. The scheme was most recently valued on 5 April 2016. At the time of the April 2016 triennial valuation, this resulted in contributions of £70.0m per annum being paid into the scheme until April 2032. Under IFRIC 14 this is considered to be a minimum funding requirement (also known as a statutory funding objective). At the current year end, the plan is in surplus; however, contributions remain payable until 2032 in order to meet the statutory funding objective. As the plan rules do not provide the Group with an unconditional right to a refund in the event of a surplus, under the requirements of IFRIC 14 the minimum funding requirement creates an obligation which is recognised as an additional liability of £1,022.4m (2017: £945.4m). The expected future benefit payments from the defined benefit plans are based on a number of assumptions including future inflation, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and are therefore inherently uncertain. Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed, or take a greater or lesser cash lump sum at retirement. The estimated duration of pension plan liabilities, which is an indicator of the weighted average term of the liabilities, is 22 years (2017: 23 years) although the benefits payable by the pension plans are expected to be paid over more than 80 years. Share options were exercised on a regular basis throughout the year. The average exercise price during the year to 31 December 2018 was £43.72 (2017: £33.34). The related shares are denominated in US dollars being the reporting currency of the ultimate parent company. The sterling exercise price of the Sharesave scheme options is fixed at the exchange rate on date of grant. _Sharesave scheme_ The scheme has been in existence for employees since 1982 and gained HMRC approval in 2000. Employees with six months' service are invited to join the scheme annually. Options are granted annually to employees who elect to join, and are exercisable in three or five years from date of grant, depending on the year of grant. Currently only three year grants are being offered. The options under this scheme are treated as cash-settled. The exercise price of the options granted is equal to the market price of the shares less 20% on the date of grant. from the award date. All RSRs are classed as unapproved from an Income Tax and National Insurance perspective. RSR awards are treated as cash-settled. The number of share awards under the RSR scheme is as follows: The following table gives the weighted average assumptions applied to the options granted during the year and are outstanding in the respective periods shown. In the Directors' opinion, the ultimate parent company and controlling party is Walmart Inc. which is incorporated in the USA.

If any such indication exists, the asset's recoverable amount is estimated. An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent from those of other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. Impairment losses on continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories consistent with the function of the impaired asset. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units (""CGU"") are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and second, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to changes in actuarial assumptions the same method (present value of the defined benefit obligation calculated with the projected unit credit method at the end of the reporting period) has been applied as when calculating the pension liability recognised within the balance sheet. These sensitivities exclude the impact of the onerous liability.

Accounting for the amount and timing of recognition of certain elements of supplier income may require the exercise of judgement. The three key types of supplier income are explained in the accounting policy on page 25. The areas requiring a level of judgement and estimation involved are considered below: Annual supplier rebates – typically these are earned and billed within the financial year of the Group. A small proportion of rebate agreements may extend beyond the year end and in these cases, estimations may be required of projected sales volumes and judgement may also need to be applied to determine the rebate level earned if agreements involve multiple tiers. All income accruals are supported by detailed calculations, based on the explicit terms in each agreement and judgements are minimal, due to the small number of agreements spanning the year end. Fixed amount supplier income – the majority of this income is earned and billed within the financial year of the Group. A small proportion of agreements may not be coterminous with the year end and, in these cases, any income accrued is supported by detailed calculations. These require judgement to determine when the terms of the agreement are satisfied and that amounts are recognised in the correct period. Supplier income recognised in the income statement and accounted for as an offset within trade payables (note 16) at the year-end for which estimation and judgement is required is £0.6m (2016: £0.4m). This represents the net amount of accrued income (£0.6m) (2016: £0.4m) and deferred income (£nil) (2016: £nil) on deals running across the year end. ### F-144 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. The financial statements of the subsidiaries are prepared for the same reporting year as the parent company however the results of International Procurement and Logistics Limited, and its subsidiaries, are consolidated one month in arrears. All intragroup balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated. Assets, liabilities, income and expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated financial statements for the relevant period the Group has control over the subsidiary. The profit or loss for the year is attributed to the equity holders of both the parent of the Group, and to the non-controlling interests. Subsidiaries which the Group controls but does not own are consolidated at carrying value, the difference between the carrying value and fair value of the assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries is not material.

The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. The choice of measurement of non-controlling interest, either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree's identifiable net assets is determined on a transaction by transaction basis. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in operating costs. When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest over the net identifiable amounts of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in exchange for the business combination. Identifiable intangible assets, meeting either the contractual-legal or separability criterion are recognised separately from goodwill. Contingent liabilities representing a present obligation are recognised if the acquisition-date fair value can be measured reliably. If the aggregate of the acquisition-date fair value of the consideration transferred and the amount recognised for the non-controlling interest is lower than the fair value of assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities and the fair value of any pre-existing interest held in the business acquired, the difference is measured in profit and loss. ### F-146 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash flows that are largely independent from those of other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered to be impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

Other leases are classified as operating leases. Where land and buildings are held under leases the determination of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings. _Finance leases_ Assets acquired by way of a finance lease are recognised at an amount equal to the lower of the fair value and the present value, calculated using the interest rate implicit in the lease, of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease with a corresponding liability as an obligation to pay future rentals. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the outstanding obligation so as to produce a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

Management determines the classification of its investments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this designation at every reporting date. All financial assets and liabilities are recognised initially at fair value. The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that financial assets are impaired. _Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit and loss_ Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the financial assets and liabilities are included in the income statement in the period in which they arise. _Loans and receivables_ Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market and are carried at amortised cost. They are included in current assets except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Loans and receivables comprise trade and other receivables. _Interest bearing loans and borrowings_ Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded initially at fair value plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently, these liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.

In a small number of instances, contractual periods may extend over the Group's year end. In such cases the amount of any income accrued in relation to these agreements is supported by detailed calculations. Supplier income is split into three classifications: Supplier incentives and discounts – which are usually expressed in the supplier agreement as an agreed amount per item sold. This type of supplier income is mechanically calculated and therefore no judgement is required in determining the amount of income to record in the financial year; Annual supplier rebates – these are earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases. The rebates are linked to pre-agreed volumes of sales or purchases of specific products and are supported by explicit contractual terms. Fixed amount supplier income – this is earned and billed within the Group's financial year in the majority of cases. Fixed monetary amounts are agreed with suppliers relating to certain promotional activities including, for example, new product listings, increased product distribution or specific promotional events. Unbilled amounts of income to which the Group is contractually entitled are included in trade and other receivables, or offset against corresponding trade payables, however these amounts are not considered material.

The key estimates and assumptions impacting the carrying value of assets and liabilities are discussed further below. _Impairment of brand intangible and goodwill_ The Group has significant carrying value of goodwill and brand related intangible assets held within intangible assets on the balance sheet. An impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions in arm's-length transactions of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from management forecasts for the next five years, with reference to the Board approved budget for the next three years. The recoverable amount is most sensitive to the sales growth, operating costs, growth rate for extrapolated cash flows and the discount rate. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount, including a sensitivity analysis, are further explained in note 11. _Intercompany royalty expense_ The Group incurs a royalty charge from the ultimate parent company. The calculation of this is based on the return on investment of the Group and the operating profit of a subsidiary undertaking within the Group. The calculation for the years ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016 is under review with the UK and US tax authorities and the royalty paid in both years has been calculated on the basis agreed for the year ended 31 December 2015. This amount constitutes the majority of the Walmart Inc. recharge disclosed in note 28. _Other_ The insurance provision (note 19) relates to liabilities arising from past events which are not covered by third party insurance. This includes both known and potential claims from stores and depots. Estimates are made with regards to determining the provision required either by actuarial assessment or based on historical experience. Judgement is made in determining whether any provision is required with regard to litigation. In accordance with IAS 37, no provision is made where a loss is not considered to be probable; disclosures of relevant matters are made in contingent liabilities (note 26). Judgement is made in determining whether balances under supply chain financing arrangements should be classified as trade payables or financing. In determining the classification, the Group reviews each arrangement against a number of characteristics and the legal form of the arrangement is considered. All balances under supply chain financing arrangements are currently treated as trade payables. In the prior year, judgement was applied in determining whether control exists in instances where a majority equity interest is not held. During the prior year, the Group acquired the non-controlling interests in the two entities where it was previously considered that control existed without a majority equity holding. From the date of these equity acquisitions, this judgement is no longer required (note 27). In previously determining whether control existed, the Group considered whether indicators of control were present including the right to financially benefit from the operations of the Company, the ability to influence the composition of the board, the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial activities of each entity and the ability to actively participate in key decision making due to the signing of legal agreements. _Pension benefits_ The carrying value of the liabilities relating to the defined benefit pension scheme is valued using an actuarial valuation. This valuation is based on assumptions. All the assumptions used are estimates of future events. Further details about the key assumptions used are given in note 18. _Share-based payment transactions_ The Group estimates fair value for share-based payment transactions depending on the terms and conditions of the grants. This estimate also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuation model including assumptions of the expected life of the share option, share price, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptions about them. The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactions are disclosed in note 18. ### F-145 ----- _Finance versus operating lease classification_ In assessing whether a lease is finance or operating in nature, assumptions and estimates need to be made including determination of the implicit interest rate, fair values of properties and the split of land and building elements of property lease contracts. Market data is used to determine these assumptions. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Each unit, or group of units, to which goodwill is allocated shall represent the lowest level within the entity at which the goodwill is monitored for internal management purposes and not be larger than an operating segment before aggregation. Where goodwill forms part of a cash-generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained. Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash generating units (""CGU"") are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and second, to reduce the carrying amount of the other assets in the unit on a pro rata basis. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset's carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. _Group as a lessor_ Assets leased out under operating leases are included in property, plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic lives. Rental income, including the effect of lease incentives, is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term. _Offsetting of financial instruments_ Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet only when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. _Fair values_ Fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm'slength transactions, reference to the current value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. _Derivative financial instruments and hedging_ Derivative financial instruments (""derivatives"") are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Derivatives are stated at their fair value. The fair value of foreign currency derivative contracts is their market value at the balance sheet date. Market values are calculated using mathematical models and are based on the duration of derivative together with quoted market data including interest rates, foreign exchange rates and market volatility at the balance sheet date. For those derivatives designated as hedges and for which hedge accounting is applied, the hedging relationship is formally designated and documented at its inception. This documentation identifies the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged and how effectiveness will be measured throughout its duration. All of the Group's hedges are considered to be cash flow hedges, hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that are either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly as other comprehensive income, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit and loss. Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement, within cost of inventories recognised as an expense, when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to profit and loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income remain in other comprehensive income until the forecast transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement, within cost of inventories recognised as an expense as part of operating costs. The Group uses forward currency contracts as hedges of its exposure to foreign currency risk in forecasted transactions and firm commitments. Refer to note 17 for further details. ### F-151 ----- deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. The amount of deferred tax provided is measured on an undiscounted basis based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. _Interest and dividend income_ Interest income is recognised in the income statement as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is recognised in the income statement on the date the Company's right to receive payments is established. Revenue for the year is as follows: Included within the remuneration totals above are emoluments and short term benefits in respect of the following directors, which are in respect of their services to the Broadstreet Great Wilson Europe Group (the ultimate parent company for the UK) as a whole: R Burnley, S Clarke, A J Moore, A Murray, A Russo, H Tatum, A Hemmerdinger, A Simpson and J Lorente Lopez. It is not possible to allocate their remuneration to individual companies within the Group. Remuneration is impacted by timing of appointment and resignation of directors. One director was a deferred member of the defined benefit scheme (2016: two). One of the directors was a member of the defined contribution scheme during the year (2016: none). During the prior year, assets relating to peppercorn leases were reclassified from intangible assets to freehold properties to better reflect the nature of these items. Assets transferred had a gross cost of £25.1m and accumulated depreciation of £nil (see note 11). Based upon calculations performed and sensitivity analysis undertaken, management believe that no reasonably possible change in any of the above key assumptions would cause the recoverable amount to be lower than the carrying value of the George brand. As at 31 December 2017, the analysis of trade receivables that were not impaired was as follows: For terms and conditions relating to amounts owed to related parties, refer to note 28. _Financial risk management_ The treasury function manages the Group's financial risk, considering its borrowings and exposure to foreign currency fluctuations. The Group finances its operations through intercompany borrowings which were issued a number of years ago and are wholly held within the Walmart group. The Group utilises its cash balances, and has access to bank overdrafts, to satisfy short-term cash flow requirements. Foreign currency exposure is managed through entering into forward currency contracts. _Interest rate risk_ The Group's short term borrowings are all held with entities which are part of the Walmart group and are at fixed rates of interest. Amounts owed to fellow subsidiaries (note 28) attract interest at a rate of 5.448% – 6% (2016: 5.448-6%). As interest rates are fixed on all of the Group's debt, interest rate movements would not have an impact on profitability, cash flow or equity. The Group does not expect to take out borrowings with a variable interest rate in the foreseeable future. _Foreign currency risk_ The Group purchases goods and services denominated in currencies other than Sterling. Cash flows can be affected by movements in exchange rates, primarily US Dollars and Euros. Some purchases in US Dollars are managed through the use of forward contracts. The Group implements hedge accounting and has forward currency hedging contracts outstanding at 31 December 2017, designated as hedges of expected future purchases from suppliers in US dollars. The forward currency contracts are being used to hedge the foreign currency risk of the future purchases. The terms of the forward currency hedging contracts have been negotiated to match the terms of the commitments and none exceed a period of more than 12 months after the 31 December 2017. Amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. The cash flow hedges of the expected future purchases were assessed to be highly effective and as at 31 December 2017, a net unrealised loss of £21.0m (2016: £36.8m gain) was included in the hedging reserve in respect of hedging contracts. The net loss recognised in other comprehensive income during the year in respect of these hedging contracts was £57.8m (2016: £20.6m gain). This consists of £35.9m gains reclassified to income statement during the year (2016: £26.2m), a £34.4m loss on not-yet-matured contracts during the year (2016: £50.8m gain), and a £12.5m taxation credit (2016: £4.0m charge). Under the Group's hedging policy, the only items for which forward currency contracts are in place are purchases of goods for resale. Gains and losses attributable to forward contracts are transferred to cost of inventories recognised as an expense within the Income Statement upon maturity of the forward contract. As the Group manages much of its foreign currency exposure through the use of forward currency contracts, changes in exchange rates are not expected to have a significant impact on short term profitability or cash flow. It is anticipated that a 5% movement in the US dollar/Sterling exchange rate, which represents management's assessment of a reasonably possible change, would give rise to a movement in hedge equity of £42.1m (2016: £32.3m). ### F-168 ----- _Credit risk_ There is no significant credit risk within the Group. The maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by their carrying value as at the balance sheet date. See note 14 for further information on trade receivables and details of recoverability. The Group has established procedures to minimise the risk of default by trade debtors including detailed credit checks undertaken before a customer is accepted. Historically, these procedures have proved effective in minimising the level of impaired and past due debtors. Surplus cash is placed on short term deposit with various global financial institutions. This is managed by the Group treasury function which actively monitors the market in order to identify the best terms of deposit. Deposit limits and approved financial institutions are dictated by the investment policy of the ultimate parent company. _Liquidity risk_ The Group's treasury function ensures that the Group continues to have sufficient funding by monitoring rolling forecasts of the Group's cash flows. The Group's objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of operating cash flows and intercompany balances. At 31 December 2017 the Group had no external borrowings. As at 31 December 2017, the Group held cash of £2,171.7m (2016: £1,862.7m), utilised along with overdrafts where necessary, to secure short term flexibility. At 31 December 2017, the Group had uncommitted overdraft facilities of £30.0m (2016: £30.0m), standby credit facilities, including bonds of £112.9m (2016: £125.7m), and uncommitted line of credit facilities of £125.0m (2016: £125.0m). The following table summarises the maturity profile of the Group's financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments. The disclosed financial derivative instruments are the gross undiscounted cash flows. However, these amounts may be settled gross or net. _Capital risk management_ The Group is subject to the risk that its capital structure will not be sufficient to support the growth of the business. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of intercompany loans payable or receivable to/from the Walmart group of companies. There were no changes to the Group's approach to capital management during the year. Full details of the Group's approach to capital management and how the Group define capital is provided on page 3. Full details of the amount of intercompany loans payable or receivable to/from the Walmart group of companies are disclosed in note 28. Responsibility for governance of the plans – including investment decisions and contribution schedules – lies with the board of trustees. The trustee body of the defined benefit plan is made up of eleven trustees: five of these are member nominated trustees including two pensioners, four are company appointed, and there are two professional independent trustees. The trustee body of the defined contribution plan is made up of seven trustees: three of these are member nominated, three are company appointed, and there is one professional independent trustee. The Group's ultimate parent company Walmart Inc., guarantees the Group's obligations to the funded defined benefit plan up to a maximum amount of £980m. This guarantee has no time limit. A schedule of contributions is in place between the Group and trustees of the funded defined benefit plan in order to pay down the deficit and the current schedule was agreed in 2017. A long term funding agreement was entered into with the trustees in 2015 whereby contributions will continue until the scheme is fully funded on a self-sufficiency basis. At the time of the April 2016 triennial valuation, this resulted in contributions of £70.0m per annum being paid into the scheme until April 2032. Under IFRIC 14 this is considered to be a minimum funding requirement (also known as a statutory funding objective). At the current year end, the plan is in surplus; however, contributions remain payable until 2024 in order to meet the statutory funding objective. As the plan rules do not provide the Group with an unconditional right to a refund in the event of a surplus, under the requirements of IFRIC 14 the minimum funding requirement creates an obligation which is recognised as an additional liability of £945.4m (2016: £791.5m). The expected future benefit payments from the defined benefit plans are based on a number of assumptions including future inflation, retirement ages, benefit options chosen and life expectancy and are therefore inherently uncertain. Actual benefit payments in a given year may be higher or lower, for example if members retire sooner or later than assumed, or take a greater or lesser cash lump sum at retirement. The estimated duration of pension plan liabilities, which is an indicator of the weighted average term of the liabilities, is 23 years (2016: 23 years) although the benefits payable by the pension plans are expected to be paid over more than 80 years. _Movements in present value of defined benefit obligation:_ _Amounts recognised in the consolidated income statement:_ _Principal actuarial assumptions (expressed as weighted averages):_ parent company at pre-determined exercise prices and two of the schemes involve the granting of rights to receive shares in the ultimate parent company for nil consideration. The executive performance share plan has performance conditions relating to the total payout of options issued, no other scheme has any performance conditions attached to the scheme. The total expenses recognised for the year arising from share based payments and the associated amounts recognised in the balance sheet are as follows: _Walmart Stock Incentive Plan (WSIP) scheme_ The scheme has been in existence since 1999. Options are granted to employees annually and are exercisable in five or seven years from dale of grant, depending on the grant agreement. The options under this scheme are treated as cash-settled. The number of share awards under the PSP scheme is as follows: The dilapidations provision represents provisions for the cost of repairs to leasehold properties at the end of their lease term. These provisions are expected to crystallise at the end of the lease term of each property. During the year, the Directors assessed the estimate of these liabilities and increased the provision by £27.1 m. This is accounted for within additions as an increase in the cost of property, plant and equipment and the impact of this will be recognised as additional depreciation over the lease terms of the sites to which the provision relates.

The standard applies to all revenue contracts and provides a model for the recognition and measurement of sales of some non-financial assets (e.g. disposals of property, plant and equipment).

Application is required for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has assessed the impact of these changes and concluded that there is no material impact to the consolidated financial statements.

Other financial assets and liabilities, such as trade receivables, trade payables, and accruals arise directly from the Group's operating activities. The difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the Group's financial instruments is not material. The following summarises the major methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments: _Fixed rate borrowings – the fair value of fixed rate borrowings is estimated by discounting the future contracted cash_ flow using appropriate interest rates to net present value. All fixed rate borrowings are held with fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate parent company. Derivatives –_ derivatives are measured at fair value by estimating the future settlement rates of forward contracts entered into and are split between in the money (assets) and out of the money (liabilities). At 31 December 2017 the Group held £nil (2016: £63.9m) in the money assets, and £29.4m (2016: £0.6m) out of the money liabilities in respect of its forward contracts. During the year, the Group recognised assets on revaluation of hedged monetary assets and liabilities from historical cost to year-end spot rate of £22.6m (2016: £11.4m liability). The fair values of the Group's financial derivatives and fixed rate borrowings with fellow subsidiaries of the ultimate parent company have been calculated at observable unquoted interest rates, and are categorised as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy in accordance with IFRS 13 'Fair Value Measurement'. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. ### F-167 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

The Group also operates two final salary defined benefit plans in the UK (one funded and one unfunded) which are closed to future accrual. With effect from 12 February 2011, the link between past service benefits and future salary increases was removed. The assets of the funded plan are placed by the trustees under the management of a number of professional fund managers and are held separately from the Group's assets. The trustees invest in a range of assets including bonds, equity securities and assets that will hedge movements in the liabilities. The trustees and Group agreed a de-risking plan in 2011 whereby the proportion of plan assets invested in liability hedging assets will increase over the period to 2021. ### F-170 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

This includes an allocation to liability matching assets which mitigate the risk of volatility in the funding level. The majority of these assets are bonds and arc included within debt securities in the table above. These liability matching assets partially hedge the scheme's interest rate risk and inflation risk, as they move in line with change in interest rate and future inflation expectations in a similar manner to the Scheme's liabilities. These risks are not fully hedged and the interest rate risk is hedged on a long term funding basis (gilts) rather than AA corporate bonds basis. Other risks to the scheme include longevity risk. ### F-172 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739

These sensitivities exclude the impact of the onerous liability. The methods and changes in assumptions used in preparing the sensitivity analysis are the same as those used in the previous period.

These entities were previously consolidated as non-controlling interests by the Group, per the conditions described in the Accounting Policies on page 19. The net assets of these entities attributable to their parent were recorded as non-controlling interests within equity. Accordingly, the acquisition of these entities has been recorded as a reduction in non-controlling interests in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. The fair value of equity interest held at the acquisition date was equal to the consideration paid (£55.3m). No goodwill was recognised on acquisition of this equity interest as both entities have been previously treated as subsidiaries and consolidated into the Group on the basis of having control over the entities. Therefore, no fair value exercise was required on acquisition of the non-controlling interest. ### F-181 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,739
