Homeowners are continuing to invest in their outdoor spaces and are increasingly recognizing the significant advantages of long-lasting products, which are converting demand away from traditional materials, particularly wood. Our products transform those outdoor spaces by combining highly appealing aesthetics with significantly lower maintenance costs compared to traditional materials. Our innovative portfolio of Outdoor Living products, including deck, rail, trim and accessories, inspires consumers to design outdoor spaces tailored to their unique lifestyle needs. We are well known in the industry, and, according to data provided by Principia, we generally hold one of the top two market share positions by revenue in our product categories. In addition to our leading suite of Outdoor Living products, we sell a broad range of highly engineered products that are sold in commercial markets, including partitions, lockers and storage solutions. One of our core values is to “always do the right thing”. We make decisions according to what is right, not what is the cheapest, fastest or easiest, and we strive to always operate with integrity, transparency and with the customer in mind. In furtherance of that value, we are focused on sustainability across our operations and have adopted strategies to enable us to meet the growing demand for environmentally-friendly products. Our businesses leverage a shared material technology and U.S.-based manufacturing platform to create products that convert demand from traditional materials to those that are long lasting and low maintenance, fulfilling our brand commitment to deliver products that are “Beautifully Engineered to Last”.

Our primary consumer brands in our Residential segment, TimberTech and AZEK, are recognized by contractors and consumers for their premium aesthetics, uncompromising quality and performance and for their diversity of style and design options. In our Commercial segment, we manufacture engineered sheet products and high-quality bathroom partitions and lockers. Over our history, we have developed a reputation as a leading innovator in our markets by leveraging our differentiated manufacturing capabilities, material science expertise and product management proficiency to consistently introduce new products into the market.

We believe our core competency of consistently launching new products into the market, combined with our recent investments in sales, marketing, R&D and manufacturing, will continue to solidify our incumbent position as a market leader and enable us to generate long term demand for our products through economic cycles. Over our 30-year history, we have introduced numerous disruptive products and demonstrated our ability to drive material conversion and extend our portfolio, addressing consumer needs across a wide range of price segments. In fiscal 2015, we introduced our Vintage premium decking collection, and through fiscal 2019, sales for these products, including new colors introduced in fiscal 2018 and variable widths introduced in fiscal 2019, have increased at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of more than 50.0% per year. The extended success of the Vintage premium decking collection demonstrates the longevity of demand for our product portfolio.

Through our recycling programs, approximately 290 million pounds of waste and scrap were diverted from landfills in fiscal 2019. Furthermore, approximately 98% of scrap generated is re-used, and the majority of our TimberTech, AZEK Exteriors and Versatex products are recyclable at the end of their useful lives. In addition to the sustainability advantages and cost benefits of our vertically integrated in-house manufacturing operations, our supplier base is located primarily in the U.S., making us less susceptible to trade disruptions or supply chain dislocations resulting from extended crises such as COVID-19. Within our Residential segment, we sell our products through a national network of more than 4,200 dealers, more than 35 distributors and multiple home improvement retailers providing extensive geographic coverage, enabling us to effectively serve contractors across the United States and Canada.

1069,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Industry Overview,9.2.1,,"Our products are widely used across several large, attractive markets, including residential and commercial end markets. We primarily serve the Outdoor Living market, which we define as the market for decks, rail, trim, wood and wood-look siding, porches, pavers, outdoor furniture, outdoor cabinetry and outdoor lighting designed to enhance the utility and improve the aesthetics of outdoor living spaces. We expect the Outdoor Living market will continue to benefit from increased investment as homeowners choose to spend more leisure time outdoors. As more members of the Millennial generation purchase first homes in the United States, we expect the demand for outdoor living spaces will rise, and the appeal of low- to no-maintenance features to gain further momentum. We believe that consumers are increasingly environmentally-conscious in their purchasing behaviors, and that our sustainable manufacturing practices and the high recycled content of our products address evolving consumer preferences. The primary products that we sell into the Outdoor Living market are composite deck, composite and aluminum rail and PVC trim. Based on data provided by Principia Consulting, LLC, a third-party industry research and consulting firm, or Principia, the total U.S. market sales of these products were $7.2 billion in 2018, grew at a 6.3% CAGR from 2014 to 2018 on a linear foot basis and are expected to grow at a 3.0% CAGR from 2018 to 2022 on a linear foot basis to $8.3 billion in 2022. By material type, based on data provided by Principia, the total U.S. market sales of composite deck, composite and aluminum rail and PVC trim products are expected to grow at a 5.7% CAGR from 2018 to 2022, compared to deck, rail and trim manufactured from wood which are expected to grow at a 2.7% CAGR and to deck, rail and trim manufactured from other materials, such as engineered wood, vinyl and other metals, which are expected to grow at a 1.4% CAGR, in each case measured in terms of linear feet. In addition, based on data provided by The Freedonia Group, Inc., an international market research company, or Freedonia, the total U.S. market sales of wood and wood-look siding, pavers, outdoor furniture and outdoor lighting were $10.9 billion in 2018, and, when combined with the total U.S. market sales of deck, rail and trim, according to Principia, in 2018, totaled $18.1 billion in 2018. Source: 2018 and 2022 projected market sizes based on data provided by Principia. (1) Represents total market (all materials). Principia market definition for trim excludes specialty exteriors products, such as tongue and groove profiles, sheets, sills, thresholds and column wraps. (2) Decking category includes composite and PVC decking, rail category includes composite and aluminum rail and trim category includes PVC trim. Based on data provided by Principia, there were approximately 57 million decks in the United States as of 2018, of which approximately 5.0 million were built in 2018, up from approximately 4.0 million in 2014, representing a CAGR of 5.9%. Decking, our single largest product category, represents a significant opportunity for homeowners to extend the total livable space of their home and to design a unique space for relaxation and entertainment. Through our portfolio of Outdoor Living products, we provide a broad range of material and design options to homeowners as they tailor their outdoor living space to their unique lifestyle. In addition, we believe that we have significant opportunities to leverage our material science expertise, brand awareness and channel relationships to expand into additional segments of the Outdoor Living market. We believe that the current COVID-19 crisis, which has caused people ----- to spend an extended amount of time at home, could be an additional catalyst that may cause an increasing number of homeowners to further identify the benefits that our portfolio of Outdoor Living products can offer. We believe our products offer a compelling value proposition due to their enhanced durability, quality, attractive aesthetics and lower life-cycle costs relative to traditional materials such as wood. For example, we estimate the total lifecycle cost of our new TimberTech EDGE Prime decking, including materials, labor and annual maintenance, is approximately 37% less expensive over its 25-year warranty period than the cost of a comparable pressure treated lumber deck. Further, given that the cost of our TimberTech EDGE Prime decking products typically constitutes approximately 15% of the total deck project installation cost, consumers have the opportunity to cost-effectively upgrade to our long-lasting, low maintenance materials by replacing traditional deck boards with our product while utilizing an existing substructure that has been appropriately maintained. Composite deck (which includes wood composite and PVC decking), rail and trim products have continued to increase market share relative to other materials, due to their superior product qualities. Based on data provided by Principia, between 2014 and 2018, composite deck, composite and aluminum rail and PVC trim products collectively grew at a CAGR of 8.7% as compared to deck, rail and trim manufactured from wood, which grew at a CAGR of 5.9%, in each case measured in terms of linear feet. We believe the market for composite products will continue to increase at an above-market growth rate as it benefits from material conversion. Based on data provided by Principia, wood represented approximately 65% of the total U.S. deck, rail and trim markets based on 2018 linear feet sold. With respect to the individual components of these markets, based on this data, composite deck represented approximately 18% of the decking market, composite and aluminum rail represented approximately 16% of the rail market and PVC trim products represented approximately 11% of the trim market, each in terms of linear feet. (1) Based on data provided by Principia. Other includes (A) hollow vinyl, plastic lumber and metal for decking, (B) iron, stainless steel, hollow vinyl and other plastic for railing and (C) engineered wood, fiber cement, vinyl, other polymer composite and other for trim. (2) Wood for the decking market includes premium hardwoods, cedar and redwood, which accounted for approximately 13% of the total decking market in 2018 according to data provided by Principia. We believe there is a significant opportunity for further market penetration by composite products as consumer awareness towards sustainable materials increases and advances in material science and manufacturing improve the range of colors and textures available. We offer products that reduce the relative premium between composite and other materials to increase the affordability and further improve the lifetime value advantages of composite products. In addition, we believe our products are well positioned to benefit from growth across economic cycles given their low market penetration and improving cost and value proposition. We believe that we have been, and will continue to be, a driving force behind the growth of low-maintenance products in our markets. Our engineered deck, trim, rail and accessory products are sold through both one-step and two-step distribution channels. Within our Residential segment, we sell our products to distributors, professional dealers and home improvement retailers, who in turn sell our products to builders, contractors and homeowners. Based on data provided by Principia, the relative industry volumes of composite deck, composite and aluminum rail and PVC trim products sold by distribution channel and by end user channel are as follows: ----- (1) Rail includes composite and aluminum rail. We are a leader within the professional dealer channel due to our depth across product categories, brand reputation and the superior quality of our products. We estimate that our U.S. decking sales represented approximately 34% of total composite decking sales in 2018 and that our U.S. trim sales represented approximately 36% of total PVC trim sales in 2018, in each case within the professional dealer channel. Based on data provided by Principia, in 2018, the retail channel represented approximately 35% of the total $3.1 billion decking market, and, within that channel, composite decking sales represented approximately $0.3 billion. We estimate approximately half of all composite decking sales through that retail channel were special order products.

We primarily serve the Outdoor Living market, which we define as the market for decks, rail, trim, wood and wood-look siding, porches, pavers, outdoor furniture, outdoor cabinetry and outdoor lighting designed to enhance the utility and improve the aesthetics of outdoor living spaces. We expect the Outdoor Living market will continue to benefit from increased investment as homeowners choose to spend more leisure time outdoors. As more members of the Millennial generation purchase first homes in the United States, we expect the demand for outdoor living spaces will rise, and the appeal of low- to no-maintenance features to gain further momentum. We believe that consumers are increasingly environmentally-conscious in their purchasing behaviors, and that our sustainable manufacturing practices and the high recycled content of our products address evolving consumer preferences. The primary products that we sell into the Outdoor Living market are composite deck, composite and aluminum rail and PVC trim. Based on data provided by Principia Consulting, LLC, a third-party industry research and consulting firm, or Principia, the total U.S. market sales of these products were $7.2 billion in 2018, grew at a 6.3% CAGR from 2014 to 2018 on a linear foot basis and are expected to grow at a 3.0% CAGR from 2018 to 2022 on a linear foot basis to $8.3 billion in 2022. By material type, based on data provided by Principia, the total U.S. market sales of composite deck, composite and aluminum rail and PVC trim products are expected to grow at a 5.7% CAGR from 2018 to 2022, compared to deck, rail and trim manufactured from wood which are expected to grow at a 2.7% CAGR and to deck, rail and trim manufactured from other materials, such as engineered wood, vinyl and other metals, which are expected to grow at a 1.4% CAGR, in each case measured in terms of linear feet. In addition, based on data provided by The Freedonia Group, Inc., an international market research company, or Freedonia, the total U.S. market sales of wood and wood-look siding, pavers, outdoor furniture and outdoor lighting were $10.9 billion in 2018, and, when combined with the total U.S. market sales of deck, rail and trim, according to Principia, in 2018, totaled $18.1 billion in 2018. Source: 2018 and 2022 projected market sizes based on data provided by Principia. (1) Represents total market (all materials). Principia market definition for trim excludes specialty exteriors products, such as tongue and groove profiles, sheets, sills, thresholds and column wraps. (2) Decking category includes composite and PVC decking, rail category includes composite and aluminum rail and trim category includes PVC trim. Based on data provided by Principia, there were approximately 57 million decks in the United States as of 2018, of which approximately 5.0 million were built in 2018, up from approximately 4.0 million in 2014, representing a CAGR of 5.9%. Decking, our single largest product category, represents a significant opportunity for homeowners to extend the total livable space of their home and to design a unique space for relaxation and entertainment. Through our portfolio of Outdoor Living products, we provide a broad range of material and design options to homeowners as they tailor their outdoor living space to their unique lifestyle. In addition, we believe that we have significant opportunities to leverage our material science expertise, brand awareness and channel relationships to expand into additional segments of the Outdoor Living market. We believe that the current COVID-19 crisis, which has caused people ----- to spend an extended amount of time at home, could be an additional catalyst that may cause an increasing number of homeowners to further identify the benefits that our portfolio of Outdoor Living products can offer. We believe our products offer a compelling value proposition due to their enhanced durability, quality, attractive aesthetics and lower life-cycle costs relative to traditional materials such as wood. For example, we estimate the total lifecycle cost of our new TimberTech EDGE Prime decking, including materials, labor and annual maintenance, is approximately 37% less expensive over its 25-year warranty period than the cost of a comparable pressure treated lumber deck. Further, given that the cost of our TimberTech EDGE Prime decking products typically constitutes approximately 15% of the total deck project installation cost, consumers have the opportunity to cost-effectively upgrade to our long-lasting, low maintenance materials by replacing traditional deck boards with our product while utilizing an existing substructure that has been appropriately maintained. Composite deck (which includes wood composite and PVC decking), rail and trim products have continued to increase market share relative to other materials, due to their superior product qualities. Based on data provided by Principia, between 2014 and 2018, composite deck, composite and aluminum rail and PVC trim products collectively grew at a CAGR of 8.7% as compared to deck, rail and trim manufactured from wood, which grew at a CAGR of 5.9%, in each case measured in terms of linear feet. We believe the market for composite products will continue to increase at an above-market growth rate as it benefits from material conversion. Based on data provided by Principia, wood represented approximately 65% of the total U.S. deck, rail and trim markets based on 2018 linear feet sold. With respect to the individual components of these markets, based on this data, composite deck represented approximately 18% of the decking market, composite and aluminum rail represented approximately 16% of the rail market and PVC trim products represented approximately 11% of the trim market, each in terms of linear feet. (1) Based on data provided by Principia. Other includes (A) hollow vinyl, plastic lumber and metal for decking, (B) iron, stainless steel, hollow vinyl and other plastic for railing and (C) engineered wood, fiber cement, vinyl, other polymer composite and other for trim. (2) Wood for the decking market includes premium hardwoods, cedar and redwood, which accounted for approximately 13% of the total decking market in 2018 according to data provided by Principia. We believe there is a significant opportunity for further market penetration by composite products as consumer awareness towards sustainable materials increases and advances in material science and manufacturing improve the range of colors and textures available. We offer products that reduce the relative premium between composite and other materials to increase the affordability and further improve the lifetime value advantages of composite products. In addition, we believe our products are well positioned to benefit from growth across economic cycles given their low market penetration and improving cost and value proposition. We believe that we have been, and will continue to be, a driving force behind the growth of low-maintenance products in our markets. Our engineered deck, trim, rail and accessory products are sold through both one-step and two-step distribution channels. Within our Residential segment, we sell our products to distributors, professional dealers and home improvement retailers, who in turn sell our products to builders, contractors and homeowners.

As these investments mature, we believe there is a significant opportunity for us to expand our margins, and we expect to use our strong cash flow generation capability to continue to repay debt and to strengthen our financial position. In addition, a large percentage of our cost base is highly variable, providing us with significant financial flexibility and the ability to manage costs to reflect changes in economic conditions.\n\nProvide your answer in JSON with no extra commentary, using this format:\n{\n  \""Answer\"": \""Yes\"" or \""No\"",\n  \""Evidence\"": \""Exact sentences or phrases from the text that support the answer (blank if No)\""\n}\n""}"

We have made significant investments in sales and marketing and R&D over the past two years to differentiate and strengthen our brands and to simplify and transform the consumer experience for purchasing our products. In 2019, we unified our decking and railing product portfolio under our leading TimberTech brand with a differentiated “Go Against the Grain” marketing campaign. We continue to invest in our marketing organization and alongside our channel partners to increase consumer awareness and preference for our products. Our focused digital strategy, enhanced media presence and differentiated marketing campaigns drive increased engagement with consumers and homeowners as well as key influencers such as architects, builders and contractors. Our new digital platform facilitates the consumer journey from inspiration and design through installation. The experience educates consumers on the features and benefits of our products versus traditional materials, utilizes digital visualization tools to allow consumers to re-imagine their outdoor living spaces and directly connects them to a pre-qualified local contractor. During fiscal 2019, website traffic to our outdoor living branded websites increased by approximately 45% and sample orders for our decking products have increased at a double-digit rate, in each case when compared to the prior year. We enjoy strong preference for our products among contractors, who typically purchase our products at dealers, and we are investing to increase our presence within home improvement retailers as the majority of consumers include visits to home improvement retailers in their research of deck products. These consumer engagement strategies are focused on creating additional pull-through demand and accelerating our growth.",,as_expected,2020,252,,
1069,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.16,Expand Margins Through Enhanced Recycling Capabilities and Productivity Initiatives,9.16.1,,"Our broad range of U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities, proprietary production technologies and extensive material science expertise position us as a leading innovator in the Outdoor Living market, and our brands command premium prices and afford us a strong margin profile. However, we believe there is an opportunity for significant improvement in our margins and cash flow profile as we continue to invest in and expand our recycling capabilities and focus on operational excellence. Since fiscal 2017, we have invested over $28 million in developing our recycling capabilities to substantially reduce our material cost, divert waste from landfills and increase our utilization of recycled materials. For example, in fiscal 2019, we increased the recycled material content used in the core of our deck boards by approximately 20%, as compared to the recycled material content in fiscal 2018. Increasing the recycled material content in our deck boards has allowed us to substantially reduce the utilization of virgin HDPE in the production of the core of our TimberTech PRO and EDGE products, representing approximately $9 million in cost savings on an annualized basis when compared to legacy material content formulations. We are still in the early stages of material substitution across our manufacturing network and realizing the benefits of our investments in recycling, and we expect to drive additional cost savings as we ramp up internal processing of recycled materials used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition to enhancing our recycling capabilities, we have also implemented various LSS initiatives across our manufacturing operations to reduce waste and enhance productivity. We utilize a systematic approach, AIMS, to drive continuous improvement throughout our organization. In fiscal 2019, we realized approximately $11 million of cost savings related to net manufacturing productivity improvements. We define net manufacturing productivity as the year-over-year change in net manufacturing expenses required to achieve a given level of manufacturing output, assuming constant raw material and other manufacturing input prices and excluding the effect of freight expense, warranty expense and unusual items. We identified and have begun to implement additional projects that we expect will provide incremental net manufacturing productivity in the coming years. We believe AIMS, our investments in people, processes and equipment and our investments in recycling, productivity and operational excellence will enable us to expand our margins and enhance our cash flow through reduced material cost, improved net manufacturing productivity and enhanced business operations.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

We have completed several strategic acquisitions since our company was founded, and we have proven to be a highly effective consolidation platform. For example, the acquisition of Versatex strengthened our position in the exterior trim and moulding market, enhanced our product capabilities and generated attractive cost savings, and the acquisition of Ultralox extended our rail portfolio to include aluminum solutions with proprietary interlocking technology and expanded our ability to address the high-growth aluminum railing market. We intend to continue to prudently execute strategic acquisitions and utilize our disciplined process to identify, evaluate, execute and integrate acquired businesses. We actively monitor a pipeline of attractive opportunities across multiple product categories and geographies. We target opportunities that strengthen our existing platforms, enhance our market positions, expand our portfolio of products and technology capabilities and increase our business diversity. In addition, the acquisitions we pursue must also provide opportunities for us to leverage our strong U.S.-based manufacturing capabilities, material formulation proficiency and extensive dealer and distributor network to meaningfully enhance their scale, growth, profitability and cash flow.

1069,Offerings 2020.md,9,SUMMARY,9.18,Recent Developments,9.18.1,COVID-19,"Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been focused on protecting our employees’ health and safety, meeting our customers’ needs as they navigate an uncertain financial and operating environment, working closely with our suppliers to protect our ongoing business operations and rapidly adjusting our short-, medium- and long-term operational plans to proactively and effectively respond to the current and potential future public health crises. While the COVID-19 pandemic presents serious concerns for our business and operations, our employees and their families, our customers and our suppliers, we believe that we are adapting well to the wide-ranging changes that the global economy is currently undergoing, and we remain confident that we will continue to maintain business continuity, produce and sell our products safely and in compliance with applicable laws and governmental orders and mandates, maintain our robust and flexible supply chains and be in a strong position to maintain financial success even in the event of a potentially extended economic downturn. Our manufacturing facilities continue to operate as they are considered “essential businesses” in the jurisdictions where they are located. Moreover, only a few states and other jurisdictions have placed construction activities on hold. Demand for our products in the second fiscal quarter of 2020 has been largely consistent in overall amount with prior years. We expect that demand for our products over the balance of fiscal 2020 will likely decline as a result of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, our medium-term expectations also include increased interest among homeowners in enhancing their Outdoor Living spaces as they spend more time at home during and likely following the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect this may partially offset a general reduction in consumer spending. We also anticipate that consumers will behave more conservatively in their spending, and we believe that we may see an increase in DIY and retail purchases. Further, we anticipate that consumers will increasingly shop online, and we continue to enhance our digital sales capabilities and utilize our direct salesforce to facilitate homeowners researching our products and ultimately purchasing them, all from the comfort and safety of their homes. We have taken a number of steps to adapt our business and operations to the current environment. First and foremost, we have implemented measures to protect the health and safety of our employees. These measures include encouraging that our employees who are able to work remotely do so, enacting and enforcing employee spacing protocols in our factories and reducing the need for face-to-face interactions, and providing facial protection to on-site employees. We have also taken steps to engage directly with our distributors to share information to ensure we are servicing the market appropriately. In addition to engaging directly with distributors, we are adapting how we reach customers in response to changing consumer behavior. For example, we are focused on expanding and enhancing our digital “shop from home” content and marketing, while leveraging our call center to support customers and generate leads. We are expanding our DIY tools and continuing our contractor and architect training in a digital format, emphasizing contactless designs and proposals for new projects. We have taken steps to reduce costs (with a cost reduction target of 15% for the second half of 2020), and we have aligned our manufacturing to current and expected demand. We have reduced our headcount in select areas, including our Vycom business, and we have the ability to adjust our manufacturing operations and output to meet demand. We are also taking steps to enhance our liquidity given the uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, including deferring non-essential capital expenditures, drawing up to the maximum amount of funds available under our Revolving Credit Facility and conserving our working capital. Although we have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including reducing our production and expenses, we expect that these measures may not fully mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict the degree to, or the period over, which we will be affected by the pandemic and resulting governmental and other measures. The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely. Nevertheless, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change rapidly and without forewarning. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, financial condition, operations or the global economy as a whole. While the spread of COVID-19 may eventually be contained or mitigated, there is no guarantee that a future outbreak of this or any other widespread epidemic will not occur, or that the global economy will recover, either of which could seriously harm our business. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the risks described in “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum. See “Risk Factors” for a further discussion of the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. -----",,as_expected,2020,252,,

This expected increase in net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2020 is primarily due to organic sales volume growth. We also estimate our net sales for the Residential segment for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to be between $200 million and $217 million compared to $185.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, representing an expected increase of between 8% and 17%, and for the Commercial segment for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to be between $33 million and $36 million compared to $34.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, representing an expected decrease of 4% or increase of 5%, respectively. Additionally, we estimate that our total net sales for the month of April 2020 slightly decreased compared to the month of April 2019. We estimate that the Residential segment’s net sales increased slightly, but were offset by decreased net sales in the Commercial segment, in each case as compared to the month of April 2019. We estimate that our Adjusted EBITDA for the three months ended March 31, 2020 will be between $55 million and $60 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $51.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, representing an expected increase of between 8% and 17%. We also estimate our Adjusted EBITDA for the Residential segment for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to be between $61 million and $66 million compared to $53.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, representing an expected increase of between 13% and 23%, and for the Commercial segment for the three months ended March 31, 2020 to be between $3 million and $4 million compared to $4.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, representing an expected decrease of between 28% and 3%. We estimate that our Adjusted Gross Profit for the three months ended March 31, 2020 will be between $91 million and $99 million, compared to Adjusted Gross Profit of $83.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, representing an expected increase of between 9% and 19%. This expected increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit for the three months ended March 31, 2020 was primarily due to organic sales volume growth and net manufacturing productivity. Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information on our calculations of Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Gross Profit, see “Selected Consolidated Financial Data—Non-GAAP Financial Measures”. We estimate that our cash and cash equivalents as of March 31, 2020 amounted to approximately $95 million, as compared to $22.5 million as of December 31, 2019, and our total indebtedness amounted to approximately $1,248 million (including borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement of $129 million and borrowings under our Term Loan Credit Agreement of $804 million), as compared to $1,121.5 million as of December 31, 2019. As of March 31, 2020 we estimate that our total liquidity was approximately $111 million, comprised of our cash and cash equivalents and approximately $16.0 million of borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Agreement. We are in the process of pursuing an amendment to our Revolving Credit Agreement, or the RCA Amendment, that would increase the percentage of borrowing base-eligible assets against which we are able to borrow, thereby potentially increasing our borrowing capacity (subject to the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement). The RCA Amendment is subject to approval by our lenders. There is no assurance that we will be successful in entering into the RCA Amendment or that the RCA Amendment will substantially increase our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement. ----- We estimate that our capital expenditures for the three months ended March 31, 2020 amounted to approximately $23 million, which includes approximately $8 million of maintenance capital expenditures, as compared to $20.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019, which includes $6.7 million of maintenance capital expenditures.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Certain of the terms and conditions described below are subject to important limitations and exceptions. The “Description of the Notes” section of this offering memorandum contains more detailed descriptions of the terms and conditions of the notes. Issuer CPG International LLC.

The global outbreak of COVID-19, and the reactions of governmental and other authorities to contain, mitigate or combat the pandemic which have severely restricted the level of economic activity around the world, have impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, our operations, and the nature, extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 or any future disease or adverse health condition is highly uncertain and beyond our control. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions, such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations. Although we have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including reducing our production and expenses, these measures may not fully mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict the degree to, or the period over, which we will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting governmental and other measures. We expect that demand for our products over the balance of fiscal 2020 will likely decline as a result of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. To address the anticipated reduction in demand for our products, we are engaging directly with our distributors to share information on market demand and ensure supply and inventory levels are appropriate. We are also reducing production across our manufacturing sites to align our output with potential reductions in demand during the balance of the year. We anticipate that distributors and dealers may choose to delay the purchase of our products, and homeowners and our industrial and commercial customers may choose to delay new construction or repair and remodeling activity, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures to contain its spread. In addition, our supply chain is largely concentrated in the United States, and although it has not been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic significantly, we may experience disruptions or delays in our supply chain in connection with the pandemic in the future, which may result in the need to seek alternate suppliers. Alternate suppliers may be more expensive, may not be available or may encounter delays in shipments to us, which would affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot estimate the extent and duration of the disruption to our supply chain, and the significance of the related financial impact. Should any such disruption continue for an extended period of time, the impact could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. On March 16, 2020, we borrowed $89.0 million under the Revolving Credit Agreement to enhance our financial flexibility in light of uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic in addition to our other borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement of $40.0 million in the aggregate during the three months ended March 31, 2020. In the longer term, our liquidity will depend on many factors, including our results of operations, our future growth, the timing and extent of our expenditures to develop new products and improve our manufacturing capabilities, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the extent to which we make acquisitions. Changes in our operating plans, material changes in anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional equity and/or debt financing in future periods. We cannot assure you if our access to capital would continue to satisfy our needs under the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will adversely affect many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, the following: ----- - We expect to experience reductions in demand for many of our products due to the economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, an increase in unemployment rates, and distributors’, dealers’ suppliers’, homeowners’ and other third parties’ diminished financial condition or financial distress. - Our distributors and dealers may be unable to meet their payment obligations to us in a timely manner. Further, other third parties, such as suppliers and other outside business partners, may experience significant disruptions in their ability to satisfy their obligations with respect to us, or they may be unable to do so altogether. - Measures that we have taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic, including, among other things, reducing our production, encouraging that our employees who are able to work remotely do so, enacting and enforcing employee physical distancing protocols in our factories and reducing the need for face-to-face interactions, are reducing the efficiency of our operations. - Additionally, we may be exposed to unexpected cybersecurity risks as a result of remote working requirements. - Illness, travel restrictions or other workforce disruptions could negatively affect our supply chain, our ability to timely and satisfactorily meet our customers’ demands or our other business processes. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we could experience a longer-term impact on our operating expenses, including as a result of, among other things, due to the need for enhanced health and hygiene requirements in our manufacturing facilities and in our corporate offices or the periodic revival of physical or social distancing or other measures in one or more regions, including the states where our manufacturing facilities are located, in attempts to counteract or prevent future outbreaks. - We have reduced the number of employees that we employ in order to reduce our operating expenses. We may experience difficulties associated with hiring additional employees or replacing employees. Increased turnover rates of our employees could increase operating costs and create challenges for us in maintaining high levels of employee awareness of and compliance with our internal procedures and external regulatory compliance requirements, in addition to increasing our recruiting, training and supervisory costs. - In addition to existing travel restrictions implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, states and other jurisdictions may continue to close borders, impose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could materially impair our ability to support our operations and customers, to source supplies through our supply chain and to identify, pursue and capture new business opportunities, and which could continue to restrict the ability of our employees to access their workplaces. We also face the possibility of increased overhead or other expenses resulting from compliance with any future government orders or other measures enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our management of the impact of COVID-19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees as well as our resources. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business will likely cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives, including the development of new products, which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. The timing for us resuming operations at or near the levels of operations experienced before the COVID-19 pandemic depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including, among other things: (1) the duration of, and any revisions in, governmental quarantine, shelter-in-place or similar social distancing orders or guidelines; (2) the occurrence and magnitude of future outbreaks; (3) the availability of vaccines or other medical remedies and preventive measures; and (4) broader economic conditions, including unemployment levels and the reaction of consumers to potentially longer-term economic uncertainty which may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Additionally, although we are reviewing any available benefits under the federal and state relief and stimulus legislation and programs, including, among other things, those under the CARES Act, at this time, we do not know whether we will be able to access any such benefits in a manner that is advantageous to us or at all.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Demand for our products depends on the level of residential and commercial improvement and renovation and new construction activity, and, in particular, the amount of spending on outdoor living spaces and home exteriors. Home and commercial renovation and improvement and new construction activity are affected by, among other things, interest rates, consumer confidence and spending habits, demographic trends, housing affordability levels, unemployment rates, institutional funding constraints, industrial production levels, tariffs and general economic conditions. For example, in our Residential segment, sales of our products depend primarily on the level of repair and remodel activity and, to a lesser extent, new construction activity. Accordingly, increases in interest rates or the reduced availability of financing can reduce the level of home improvement and new construction activity and the demand for our products. In addition, the residential repair and remodel market depends in part on home equity financing, and accordingly, the level of equity in homes will affect consumers’ ability to obtain a home equity line of credit and engage in renovations that would result in purchases of our products. Accordingly, a weakness in home prices may result in a decreased demand for our residential products. Many of our residential products are impacted by consumer demand for, and spending on, outdoor living spaces and home exteriors. For example, sales of our deck and rail products depend on lifestyle and architectural trends and the extent to which consumers prioritize spending to enhance outdoor living spaces for their homes. While we believe consumer preferences have increased spending on outdoor living and home exteriors in recent years, the level of spending could decrease in the future. Decreased spending on outdoor living spaces and home exteriors generally or as a percentage of home improvement activity may decrease demand for our deck, railing and trim products. Demand for our products in our Commercial segment is affected by the level of commercial and governmental construction and renovation activity. The levels of commercial and governmental construction and renovation activity are affected by the levels of interest rates, availability of financing for commercial and industrial projects, the general business environment and the availability of governmental funding. Sales of products by our Commercial segment include sales for use in institutions, such as universities and schools, and in federal, state and local government buildings, which depend on federal, state and local funding for construction and renovation projects. Sales to institutions that depend on public funding are affected by factors that may impose constraints on funding availability for construction and renovation projects, including increased operational costs, budget cuts by federal, state and local governments, including as a result of lower than anticipated tax revenues, increased limitations on federal spending or government shutdowns. Sales to commercial establishments depend on, among other things, general levels of industrial production and business growth and the performance of the various markets in which our commercial end customers operate. Adverse trends in any of the foregoing factors could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such factors could also alter the balance of our Residential and Commercial sales or the balance of our product sales within either such segment. In light of differing margins, changes in the relative amount and type of residential and commercial industrial activity or the mix of products sold may have an impact on our business and cause our revenues and profitability to fluctuate from period to period.",,as_expected,2020,252,,
1069,Offerings 2020.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Relating to Our Business and Industry,13.1.4,"We operate in a competitive business environment. If we are unable to compete effectively our sales would suffer and our business, financial condition and operating results would be adversely affected.","We operate in a competitive business environment, and we compete with multiple companies with respect to each of our products. While we have longstanding business relationships with many of our distributors, dealers and contractors, we generally do not have long-term contracts with these customers. Accordingly, any failure to compete effectively, including as a result of the various factors described below, could cause our customers to cease purchasing our products or rapidly decrease our sales. Our residential products compete primarily with wood products that comprise the majority of decking, railing, trim and related market sales. We also compete with metal products and with engineered products sold by other companies. In our Commercial segment, we compete in several highly fragmented markets. Our Vycom products compete with products sold into narrow market segments with a wide range of end uses through specialized distribution networks that vary depending on the particular end use. Products made by Scranton Products compete with bathroom partitions, lockers and storage solutions sold at a wide range of prices and manufactured using a variety of materials. Our business model relies on the continued conversion in demand from traditional wood products to our engineered products, and our business could suffer if this conversion does not continue in the future. A number of suppliers of wood and wood composite deck, trim and rail products have established relationships with contractors, builders and large home improvement retailers, and, to ----- compete successfully, we must expand and strengthen our relationships with those parties. We must also compete successfully with products from other manufacturers that offer alternatives to wood and wood composite products, including by developing competitive new products and by responding successfully to new products introduced, and pricing and other competitive actions taken, by competitors. Some of our competitors have financial, production, marketing and other resources that are significantly greater than ours. Consolidation by industry participants could further increase their resources and result in competitors with expanded market share, larger customer bases, greater diversified product offerings and greater technological and marketing expertise, which may allow them to compete more effectively against us. Moreover, our competitors may develop products that are superior to our products (on a priceto-value basis or otherwise) or may adapt more quickly to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Technological advances by our competitors may lead to new manufacturing techniques and make it more difficult for us to compete.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

The effect of the pandemic may exceed the quarterly changes in our operating results that we have typically experienced from seasonality, weather conditions, and product mix. We have typically experienced moderately higher levels of sales of our residential products in the second fiscal quarter of the year as a result of our “early buy” sales and extended payment terms typically available during the second fiscal quarter of the year. As a result of these extended payment terms, our accounts receivable have typically reached seasonal peaks at the end of the second fiscal quarter of the year, and our net cash provided by operating activities has typically been lower in the second fiscal quarter relative to other quarters. Our sales are also generally impacted by the number of days in a quarter or a year that contractors and other professionals are able to install our products. We have generally experienced lower levels of sales of residential products during the first fiscal quarter due to adverse weather conditions in certain markets, which typically reduces the construction and renovation activity during the winter season. Although our products can be installed year-round, unusually adverse weather conditions can negatively impact the timing of the sales of certain of our products, causing reduced sales and negatively impacting profitability when such conditions exist. Our residential products are generally purchased shortly before installation and used in outdoor environments. As a result, there is a correlation between the amount of products we sell and weather conditions during the time they are to be installed. Adverse weather conditions may interfere with ordinary construction, delay projects or lead to cessation of construction involving our products. Prolonged adverse weather conditions could significantly reduce our sales in one or more periods. These conditions may shift sales to subsequent reporting periods or decrease overall sales, given the limited outdoor construction season in many locations. In addition, we have experienced higher levels of sales of our engineered bathroom partition products and our locker products during the second half of our fiscal year, which includes the summer months during which schools are typically closed and therefore more likely to be undergoing remodel activities. These factors can cause our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly basis. Our operating results may also fluctuate due to changes in the mix of products sold. We sell products at different prices, composed of different materials and involving varying levels of manufacturing complexity. Changes in the mix of products sold from period to period may affect our average selling price, cost of sales and gross margins.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

We may not be successful in anticipating these needs or preferences or in developing new and improved products. If we do not respond effectively to changing market trends, demands and preferences and to actions by competitors by introducing competitive new products, our business, financial condition and results of operations would suffer. Even if we do introduce new products in the market, consumers may not choose our new products over existing products. In addition, competitors could introduce new or improved products that would replace or reduce demand for our products or develop proprietary changes in manufacturing technologies that may render our products obsolete or too expensive to compete effectively. In addition, when we introduce new products, we must effectively anticipate and manage the effect of new product introductions on sales of our existing products. If new products displace sales of existing products more broadly or rapidly than anticipated, we may have excess inventory of existing products and be required to reduce prices on existing products, which could adversely affect our results of operations. As we continue to introduce new products at varying price points to broaden our product offerings to compete with products made with wood or other traditional materials across a wide range of prices, our overall gross margins may vary from period ----- to period as a result of changes in product mix. Moreover, we may introduce new products with initially lower gross margins with the expectation that the gross margins associated with those products may improve over time as we improve our manufacturing efficiency for those products, and our results of operations would be adversely affected if we are unable to realize the anticipated improvements. Although we are reducing our expansion and capital expenditures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in the past we have devoted, and in the future we expect to continue to devote, significant resources to developing new products. However, we cannot be sure that we will successfully complete the development and testing of new products and be able to release the products when anticipated or at all. From time to time, we may make investments in the development of products we ultimately determine not to release resulting in write-downs of inventory and related assets.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Periodic manufacturing integrations, realignments and cost savings programs and other changes have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our operating efficiency and results of operations during the periods in which such programs are being implemented. Such programs may include the addition of manufacturing lines and the consolidation, integration and upgrading of facilities, functions, systems and procedures, including the introduction of new manufacturing technologies and product innovations. These programs involve substantial planning, often require capital investments, and may result in charges for fixed asset impairments or obsolescence and substantial severance costs. Our ability to achieve cost savings or other benefits within the time frames we anticipate is subject to many estimates and assumptions, a number of which are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties. For example, we have made substantial investments to expand our recycling capabilities and to increase the use of reclaimed materials in our manufacturing processes. While we anticipate that enhancing these capabilities will ultimately decrease our costs, the introduction of these capabilities has required significant initial investment, and we cannot be certain we will realize the benefits of this initiative when anticipated or at all. If these investments and other changes are not effectively integrated into our manufacturing processes, we may suffer from production delays, lower efficiency and manufacturing yields, increased costs and reduced net sales. We must also effectively address changes to our manufacturing operations resulting from growth of our business generally and introduction of new products. As we increase our manufacturing capacity to meet market demand or begin to manufacture new products at scale, we may face unanticipated manufacturing challenges as production volumes increase, new processes are implemented and new supplies of raw materials used in these products are secured. New products may initially be more costly and less efficient to produce than our existing products. In addition, we could experience delays in production as we increase our manufacturing capacity or begin to manufacture new products that may result in the products ordered by our customers being on backorder as initial production issues are addressed. As a result, increases in manufacturing capacity or the introduction of new products may initially be associated with lower efficiency and manufacturing yields and increased costs, including shipping costs to fill backorders. If we experience production delays or inefficiencies, a deterioration in the quality of our products or other complications in managing changes to our manufacturing processes, including those that are designed to increase capacity, enhance efficiencies and reduce costs or that relate to new products or technologies, we may not achieve the benefits that we anticipate from these actions when expected, or at all, and our operations could experience disruptions, our manufacturing efficiency could suffer and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Our top ten distributors collectively accounted for a majority of our net sales for the year ended September 30, 2019. Our largest distributor, Parksite Inc., accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales for the year ended September 30, 2019. While we have long-standing business relationships with many of our key distributors and our distribution contracts generally provide for exclusive relationships with respect to certain products within certain geographies, these contracts typically permit the distributor to terminate for convenience on several months’ notice. The loss of, or a significant adverse change in, our relationships with one or more of our significant distributors could materially reduce our net sales. Distributors and dealers that sell our products, are sensitive to meeting the demands of their end customers on a timely basis. Dealers that sell our products typically place orders with our distributors that need to be filled in a short time frame and these dealers typically do not have an exclusive relationship with us. Purchases by our distributors and dealers are affected by their individual decisions on the levels of inventory they carry, their views on product demand, their financial condition and the manner in which they choose to manage inventory risk. In addition, purchases by distributors and dealers are affected by a variety of other factors, including ----- product pricing, increases in the number of competitive producers and the production capacity of other producers, new product introductions, changes in levels of home renovation and new construction activity, and weather-related fluctuations in demand. As a result, demand for our products can be difficult to predict. If we do not forecast and plan production effectively to manufacture sufficient products to meet demand or if we experience delays in our ability to manufacture products, dealers may seek alternative products, including those of our competitors. Failure to meet demand requirements on a timely basis, may cause distributors or dealers to build up inventory as a precautionary measure, rapidly shift their product mix away from our products, harm our long-term relationships with distributors and dealers, harm our brand and reduce, or increase the variability of, our net sales. We must continue to provide product offerings at price points that meet the needs of distributors and dealers and that they perceive to be competitive with the products on the market. If our key distributors or dealers are unwilling to continue to sell our products at existing or higher levels, or if they desire to sell competing products alongside our products, our ability to maintain or increase our sales could suffer. In addition, mergers or acquisitions involving our distributors or dealers and one of our competitors, or a distributor or dealer with a relationship with one of our competitors, could decrease or eliminate purchases of our product by that distributor or dealer. If a key distributor or dealer were to terminate its relationship with us or reduce purchases of our products, we may not be able to replace that relationship with a relationship with a new distributor or dealer in a timely manner or at all. In addition, any such new relationship may take time to develop and may not be as favorable to us as the relationship it is replacing.

We also utilize other additives including modifiers, titanium dioxide, or TiO2, and pigments. Our contracts with key suppliers are typically short term in nature, with terms generally ranging from one to three years. While we do not rely on any single supplier for the majority of our raw materials, we do obtain certain raw materials from single or a limited number of suppliers. In particular, we rely on a single supplier for certain critical capped compounds used in our deck and railing products. We do not currently have arrangements in place for a redundant or secondsource supply for those compounds. If one or more suppliers were unable to satisfy our requirements for particular raw materials, we believe alternative sources of supply would be available. However, we could experience a disruption to our operations as alternative suppliers are identified and qualified and new supply arrangements are entered into, and we cannot be sure we will be able to identify alternative sources of supply rapidly, without incurring significant costs or at all. In the event of an industry-wide general shortage of our raw materials, a shortage affecting or discontinuation in providing any such raw materials by one or more of our suppliers or a supplier’s declaration of force majeure, we may not be able to arrange for alternative sources of such materials on a timely basis or on equally favorable terms. We have also recently significantly increased the use of reclaimed polyethylene and PVC material in our products. As we increase our use of such materials and introduce new materials into our manufacturing processes, we may be unable to obtain adequate quantities of such new raw materials in a timely manner. Any such shortage may materially adversely affect our production process as well as our competitive position as compared to companies that are able to source their raw materials more reliably or at lower cost. In addition, significant increases in the cost of the raw materials used to manufacture our products could adversely affect our operating results. The cost of some of the raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products is subject to significant price volatility. For example, the cost of petrochemical resins used in our manufacturing processes has historically varied significantly and has been affected by changes in supply and demand and in the price of crude oil. We have not entered into hedges of our raw material costs, and our supply contracts with our major vendors do not contain obligations to sell raw materials to us at a fixed price. Accordingly, we are exposed to the risk of increases in the market prices of raw materials used in the manufacture of our products. Our results of operations have been affected in the past by changes in the cost of resins, and we expect that our results of operations in the future will continue to be affected by changes in resin costs. In the event of an increase in the cost of resins or other raw materials, we may not be able to recover the increases through corresponding increases in the prices of our products. Even if we are able to increase prices over time, we may not be able to increase prices as rapidly as the increase in our costs. If we are unable to increase our prices or experience a delay in our ability to increase our prices or to recover such increases in our costs, our gross profit will suffer. In addition, increases in the price of our products to compensate for increased costs of raw materials may reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our competitive position as compared to products made of other materials, such as wood and metal, that are not affected by changes in the price of resins and some of the other raw materials that we use in the manufacture of our products. We are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers to consistently provide raw materials that meet our specifications, quality standards and other applicable criteria. Our suppliers’ failure to provide raw materials that meet such criteria could adversely affect production schedules and our product quality, which in turn could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. -----",,as_expected,2020,252,,

If we are unable to maintain the quality and performance of our products at acceptable costs, our brand, the market acceptance of our products and our results of operations would suffer. As we regularly modify our product lines and introduce changes to our manufacturing processes or incorporate new raw materials, we may encounter unanticipated issues with product quality or production delays. For example, we have recently introduced products that incorporate larger proportions of reclaimed raw materials, primarily reclaimed polyethylene and PVC. While we engage in product testing in an effort to identify and address any product quality issues before we introduce products to market, unanticipated product quality or performance issues may be identified after a product has been introduced and sold.

The first material weakness relates to the maintenance of an effective control environment as we lacked a sufficient complement of resources. This material weakness contributed to an additional material weakness relating to the design and maintenance of formal accounting policies, procedures and controls. The third relates to the design and maintenance of effective controls over certain information technology general controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The first material weakness relates to the fact that we did not design or maintain an effective control environment commensurate with our financial reporting requirements. Specifically, we lacked a sufficient complement of resources with an appropriate level of accounting knowledge, training and experience to appropriately analyze, record and disclose accounting matters timely and accurately. This material weakness contributed to the following additional three material weaknesses. The second material weakness relates to the fact that we did not design and maintain adequate formal accounting policies, procedures and controls, or maintain documentary evidence of existing control activities. Specifically, we did not design and maintain adequate formal accounting policies, procedures and controls to achieve complete, accurate and timely financial accounting, reporting and disclosures, including adequate controls over the preparation and review of account reconciliations and journal entries. Additionally, we did not maintain adequate documentary evidence of existing control activities, and we did not design and maintain controls over the appropriate classification and presentation of accounts and disclosures in the financial statements. We also had a previous material weakness, which was remediated during fiscal 2019, that related to the fact that we did not design and maintain formal accounting policies, procedures and controls to analyze, account for and disclose non-routine or complex transactions. These two remaining material weaknesses and the previous material weakness resulted in revision of our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2018 and for the year then ended, and in immaterial audit adjustments to our consolidated financial statements as of September 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017 and for the years then ended. As of September 30, 2019, we also have a third material weakness as a result of the material weakness in our control environment in that we did not design and maintain effective controls over certain information technology, or IT, general controls for information systems and applications that are relevant to the preparation of the financial statements. Specifically, we did not design and maintain: - User access controls to ensure appropriate segregation of duties and that adequately restrict user and privileged access to financial applications, programs and data to appropriate Company personnel; - Program change management controls to ensure that IT program and data changes affecting financial IT applications and underlying accounting records are identified, tested, authorized and implemented appropriately; - Computer operations controls to ensure that critical batch jobs are monitored, and data backups are authorized and monitored; and - Testing and approval controls for program development to ensure that new software development is aligned with business and IT requirements. These IT control deficiencies did not result in a misstatement to Newco’s financial statements. However, the deficiencies, when aggregated, could impact maintaining effective segregation of duties, as well as the effectiveness of IT-dependent controls (such as automated controls that address the risk of material misstatements to one or more assertions, and IT controls and underlying data that support the effectiveness of IT system-generated data and reports). ----- Each of the remaining material weaknesses described above involve control deficiencies that could result in a misstatement of one or more account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected, and, accordingly, we determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. We are in the process of taking steps intended to address the underlying causes of the material weaknesses and to remediate the three remaining material weaknesses. Our efforts to date have included: (i) hiring additional qualified finance and accounting personnel, including the hiring of a new Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer; (ii) the implementation of formal policies, procedures and controls, training on standards of documentary evidence, as well as implementation of controls designed to ensure the reliability of critical spreadsheets and system generated reports; and (iii) designing and engaging in the implementation of an IT general controls framework that addresses risks associated with user access and security, application change management and IT operations, focused training for control owners to help sustain effective control operations and comprehensive remediation efforts relating to segregation of duties to strengthen user access controls and security. While we believe these efforts will improve our internal controls and address the underlying causes of the three remaining material weaknesses, such material weaknesses will not be fully remediated until our remediation plan has been fully implemented and we have concluded that our controls are operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. For more information on our efforts to remediate these material weaknesses, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operations—Internal Control over Financial Reporting.” We cannot be certain that the steps we are taking will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or prevent future material weaknesses or control deficiencies from occurring. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have identified all material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or that in the future we will not have additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we fail to effectively remediate the remaining material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may be unable to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations. We also could become subject to sanctions by regulatory authorities.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

These laws regulate, among other things, air emissions, the discharge or release of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, remediation of contaminated sites, worker health and safety and the impact of products on human health and safety and the environment. Under some of these laws, liability for contaminated property may be imposed on current or former owners or operators of the property or on parties that generated or arranged for waste sent to the property for disposal. Liability under these laws may be joint and several and may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of the activity giving rise to the contamination. Our facilities are located on sites that have been used for manufacturing activities for an extended period of time, which increases the possibility of contamination being present. Despite our compliance efforts, we may still face material liability, limitations on our operations or fines or penalties for violations of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including releases of regulated materials and contamination by us or previous occupants at our current or former properties or at offsite disposal locations we use. We are also subject to permitting requirements under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Those requirements obligate us to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to conduct our operations. Such permits are typically issued by state agencies, but permits and approvals may also be required from federal or local governmental agencies. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where our regulated activities are conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. Any failure to obtain or delay in obtaining a permit required for our operations, or the imposition of onerous conditions in any such permits, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations.

In the event that our trademarks or service marks are successfully challenged and we lose the rights to use those trademarks or service marks, or if we fail to prevent others from using them (or similar marks), we could be forced to rebrand our products, requiring us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. In addition, we cannot be sure that any pending trademark or service mark applications will be granted or will not be challenged or opposed by third parties or that we will be able to enforce our trademark rights against counterfeiters. We generally rely on a combination of unpatented proprietary know-how and trade secrets, and to a lesser extent, patents to preserve our position in the market. Because of the importance of our proprietary know-how and trade secrets, we employ various methods to protect our intellectual property, such as entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and controlling access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information. We may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching confidentiality obligations and misappropriating proprietary information. It is difficult for us to monitor unauthorized uses of our products and technology. Accordingly, these protections may not be adequate to prevent competitors from copying, imitating or reverse engineering our products or from developing and marketing products that are substantially equivalent to or superior to our own.

For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, which was enacted into law on December 22, 2017, imposes limitations on the deductibility of interest on mortgages qualifying of the home mortgage interest deduction. Beginning in 2018, taxpayers may only deduct interest on $750,000 of qualified residence loans, including home equity loans that are used to substantially improve the taxpayer’s home that secures the loan, a reduction from the prior limit of $1.0 million. As many consumers finance renovation projects that use our products with home equity loans, limitations on the deductibility of interest on those loans could reduce demand for our products. In addition, recent U.S. federal and state legislative and regulatory policies enacted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic provide various measures of relief for homeowners, primarily in the form of mortgage payment forbearance for homeowners with federally-backed mortgages and temporary moratoria on foreclosures and evictions.

On March 27, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, was signed into law and modifies certain provisions under the Tax Act. The CARES Act, among other things, increased the limitation on the deductibility of business interest to 50% of “adjusted taxable income” for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018 and before January 1, 2021 and allows taxpayers to elect to compute the limitation on business interest expense for 2020 by using its “adjusted taxable income” from 2019. The CARES Act also suspends the 80% limitation on the deduction of net operating losses for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021 as well as enables taxpayers to carry back net operating losses generated in a taxable year beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 to each of the five preceding taxable years. The CARES Act also contains provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer side social security payments, alternative minimum tax credit refunds and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property that may impact our business and financial results. The most significant impacts of the Tax Act on our financial results to date have included lowering of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities. During the year ended September 30, 2018, we recorded a $22.5 million net income tax benefit for the remeasurement of certain deferred taxes, and our effective tax rate for the year was significantly reduced by the recognition of this remeasurement. We expect the limitation under the Tax Act on the tax deduction of interest expense will limit our annual deductions of interest expense as a result of our significant outstanding indebtedness until we reduce our outstanding indebtedness or our adjusted earnings increase by an amount sufficient to permit full deductibility of our interest expense. In the event we are subject to limitations on the deductibility of interest under the Tax Act, we will be permitted an indefinite carryforward, and disallowed interest expense will be deductible in later years, subject to the same 30% limitation (or 50% ----- limitation under the CARES Act for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2018 and before January 1, 2021) and to ownership change limitations under Sections 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, similar to net operating losses.

National and international regulators and law enforcement agencies have conducted investigations into a number of rates or indices known as “reference rates.” Actions by such regulators and law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the manner in which certain reference rates are determined, their discontinuance or the establishment of alternative reference rates. In particular, on July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, or the FCA, which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Such announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. As a result, it appears highly likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other reference rate, or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR, other benchmarks or LIBOR-based debt instruments.

We may require additional financing from third parties to fund any such purchases, and may be unable to obtain financing on satisfactory terms or at all. Further, our ability to repurchase the notes may be limited by law. In order to avoid the obligations to repurchase the notes and events of default and potential breaches of the credit agreements that will govern the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, we may have to avoid certain change of control transactions that would otherwise be beneficial to us.

See “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of Control.” The exercise by the holders of notes of their right to require us to repurchase the notes pursuant to a change of control offer could cause a default under the agreements governing our other indebtedness, including the Senior Secured Credit Facilities and future agreements, even if the change of control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchases on us. In the event a change of control offer is required to be made at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing notes, we could attempt to refinance the borrowings that contain such prohibitions. If we do not obtain a consent or repay those borrowings, they will remain prohibited from purchasing notes. In that case, our failure to purchase tendered notes would constitute an event of default under the Indenture which could, in turn, constitute a default under our other indebtedness.

Under federal bankruptcy law and comparable provisions of state fraudulent transfer or conveyance laws, which may vary from state to state, the notes or the note guarantees thereof could be voided as a fraudulent transfer or conveyance if we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, (a) issued the notes or incurred the note guarantees with the intent of hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors or (b) received less than reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration in return for either issuing the notes or incurring the note guarantees and, in the case of (b) only, one of the following is also true at the time thereof: - we or any of the guarantors, as applicable, were insolvent or rendered insolvent by reason of the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the note guarantees; ----- - the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of the note guarantees left us or any of the guarantors, as applicable, with an unreasonably small amount of capital or assets to carry on the business; - we or any of the guarantors intended to, or believed that we or such subsidiary guarantor would, incur debts beyond our or such guarantor’s ability to pay as they mature; or - we or any of the guarantors were a defendant in an action for money damages, or had a judgment for money damages docketed against us or the guarantor if, in either case, the judgment is unsatisfied after final judgment. As a general matter, value is given for a transfer or an obligation if, in exchange for the transfer or obligation, property is transferred or a valid antecedent debt is secured or satisfied. A court would likely find that a guarantor did not receive reasonably equivalent value or fair consideration for its note guarantee to the extent the guarantor did not obtain a reasonably equivalent benefit directly or indirectly from the issuance of the notes. We cannot be certain as to the standards a court would use to determine whether or not we or the guarantors were insolvent at the relevant time or, regardless of the standard that a court uses, whether the notes or the note guarantees would be subordinated to us or any of our guarantors’ other debt. In general, however, a court would deem an entity insolvent if: - the sum of its debts, including contingent and unliquidated liabilities, was greater than the fair saleable value of all of its assets; - the present fair saleable value of its assets was less than the amount that would be required to pay its probable liability on its existing debts, including contingent liabilities, as they become absolute and mature; or - it could not pay its debts as they became due. If a court were to find that the issuance of the notes or the incurrence of a note guarantee was a fraudulent transfer or conveyance, the court could void the payment obligations under the notes or that note guarantee, subordinate the notes or that note guarantee to our presently existing and future indebtedness ours or of the related subsidiary guarantor, or require the holders of the notes to repay any amounts received with respect to that note guarantee. In the event of a finding that a fraudulent transfer or conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the notes. Further, the avoidance of the notes could result in an event of default with respect to our debt and our subsidiaries’ other debt that could result in acceleration of that debt.

However, the initial purchasers are not obligated to make a market in the notes and, if commenced, may discontinue their market-making activities at any time without notice. Therefore, an active market for the notes may not develop or be maintained, which would adversely affect the market price and liquidity of the notes. In such case, the holders of the notes may not be able to sell their notes at a particular time or at a favorable price. If a trading market were to develop, future trading prices of the notes may be volatile and will depend on many factors, including: - the number of holders of notes; - prevailing interest rates; - our operating performance and financial condition; - the interest of securities dealers in making a market for them; and - the market for similar securities.

The market, if any, for the notes may experience similar disruptions and any such disruptions may adversely affect the liquidity in that market or the prices at which you may sell your notes. In addition, subsequent to their initial issuance, the notes may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending upon prevailing interest rates, the market for similar notes, our performance and other factors.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Our GAAP financial results include significant expenses that are not indicative of our ongoing operations as detailed in the tables below. However, non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in their usefulness to investors because they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and are not prepared under any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest expense, net, income tax (benefit) expense and depreciation and amortization and by adding to or subtracting therefrom items of expense and income as described above. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is equal to Adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales. We believe Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are useful to investors because they help identify underlying trends in our business that could otherwise be masked by certain expenses that can vary from company to company depending on, among other things, its financing, capital structure and the method by which its assets were acquired, and can also vary significantly from period to period. We also add back depreciation and amortization and share-based compensation because we do not consider them indicative of our core operating performance. We believe their exclusion facilitates comparisons of our operating performance on a period-to-period basis. Therefore, we believe that showing gross profit and net income, as adjusted to remove the impact of these expenses, is helpful to investors in assessing our gross profit and net income performance in a way that is similar to the way management assesses our performance. Additionally, EBITDA and EBITDA margin are common measures of operating performance in our industry, and we believe they facilitate operating comparisons. Our management also uses Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction with other GAAP financial measures for planning purposes, including as a measure of our core operating results and the effectiveness of our business strategy, and in evaluating our financial performance. Management considers Adjusted Gross Profit as a useful measure because our cost of sales includes the depreciation of property, plant and equipment used in the production of products and the amortization of various intangibles related to our manufacturing processes. Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: - These measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - These measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; ----- - Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on our debt; - Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin do not reflect our income tax expense or the cash requirements to pay our taxes; - Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA exclude the expense of depreciation and amortization of our assets, and, although these are non-cash expenses, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future; - Adjusted EBITDA excludes the expense associated with our equity compensation plan, although equity compensation has been, and will continue to be, an important part of our compensation strategy; - Adjusted Gross Profit and Adjusted EBITDA exclude certain business transformation costs, acquisition costs and other costs, each of which can affect our current and future cash requirements; and - Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, none of these metrics should be considered indicative of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or as measures of cash that will be available to us to meet our obligations.

Homeowners are continuing to invest in their outdoor spaces and are increasingly recognizing the significant advantages of long-lasting products, which are converting demand away from traditional materials, particularly wood. Our products transform those outdoor spaces by combining highly appealing aesthetics with significantly lower maintenance costs compared to traditional materials. Our innovative portfolio of Outdoor Living products, including deck, rail, trim and accessories, inspires consumers to design outdoor spaces tailored to their unique lifestyle needs. We are well known in the industry, and, according to data provided by Principia, we generally hold one of the top two market share positions by revenue in our product categories. In addition to our leading suite of Outdoor Living products, we sell a broad range of highly engineered products that are sold in commercial markets, including partitions, lockers and storage solutions. One of our core values is to “always do the right thing”. We make decisions according to what is right, not what is the cheapest, fastest or easiest, and we strive to always operate with integrity, transparency and the customer in mind. In furtherance of that value, we are focused on sustainability across our operations and have adopted strategies to enable us to meet the growing demand for environmentally-friendly products. Our businesses leverage a shared technology and U.S.-based manufacturing platform to create products that convert demand from traditional materials to those that are long lasting and low maintenance, fulfilling our brand commitment to deliver products that are “Beautifully Engineered to Last”.

1069,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.3.1,Volume of Products Sold,"Our net sales depend primarily on the volume of products we sell during any given period, and volume is affected by the following items: ----- - _Economic conditions: Demand for our products is significantly affected by a number of economic factors impacting our customers and consumers. For example, demand for products sold by our Residential segment is driven primarily by home repair and remodeling activity and, to a lesser extent, new home construction activity. The residential repair and remodeling market depends in part on home equity financing, and accordingly, the level of equity in homes will affect consumers’ ability to obtain a home equity line of credit and engage in renovations that would result in purchases of our products. Demand for our products is also affected by the level of interest rates and the availability of credit, consumer confidence and spending, housing affordability, demographic trends, employment levels and other macroeconomic factors that may influence the extent to which consumers engage in repair and remodeling projects to enhance the outdoor living spaces of their homes. Sales by our Commercial segment in the institutional construction market are affected by amounts available for expenditures in school construction, military bases and other public institutions, which depend in part on the availability of government funding and budgetary priorities. Sales of our engineered polymer materials in our industrial OEM markets are also affected by macroeconomic factors, in particular gross domestic product levels and levels of industrial production. Changes in these economic conditions can impact the volume of our products sold during any given period. - _Material conversion: We have continued to increase sales of our products through our focused efforts to drive material conversion and market penetration of our products. We believe that there is a long-term trend toward material conversion from traditional materials, such as wood, to the low-maintenance, engineered materials we produce. We believe that our products offer a compelling value proposition due to their enhanced durability and lower maintenance costs compared to products manufactured from traditional materials, and we anticipate that sales of our products will continue to benefit from material conversion. The success of our efforts to drive conversion during any given period will impact the volume of our products sold during that period. - _Product innovation: We continue to develop and introduce innovative products to accelerate material conversion and expand our markets. We believe that new products will enhance our ability to compete with traditional materials at a variety of price points, and we expect to continue to devote significant resources to developing innovative new products. The volume of our products sold during a given period will depend in part on our successfully introducing new products that generate additional demand as well as the extent to which new products may impact our sales of existing products. - _Marketing and distribution: Demand for our products is influenced by our efforts to expand and enhance awareness of our premium brands and the benefits of our products as well as to drive continued material conversion. Within our Residential segment, we sell our products through a national network of more than 4,200 dealers, more than 35 distributors and multiple home improvement retailers providing extensive geographic coverage enabling us to effectively serve contractors across the United States and Canada. Within our Commercial segment, we sell our products through a widespread distribution network as well as directly to OEMs. Our customer-focused sales organization generates pull-through demand for our products by driving increased downstream engagement with consumers and key influencers such as architects, builders and contractors and by focusing on strengthening our position with dealers and growing our presence in retail. Our volume of product sales in a given period will be impacted by our ability to raise awareness of our brands and products.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Our pricing strategy differs as between our two operating segments as follows: - _Residential: Prices for our residential products are typically set annually, taking into account anticipated changes in input costs, market dynamics and new product introductions by us or our competitors. - _Commercial: A number of our commercial product sales, such as those related to our partitions and lockers product lines, are customized by order, and, therefore, these products are typically priced based on the nature of the particular specifications ordered. For other commercial products, such as various Vycom product lines, we maintain standard pricing lists that we review and change periodically.",,as_expected,2020,252,,
1069,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.3.3,Cost of Materials,"Raw material costs, including costs of petrochemical resins, reclaimed polyethylene and PVC material, waste wood fiber and aluminum, represent a majority of our cost of sales. The cost of petrochemical resins used in our manufacturing processes has historically varied significantly and has been affected by changes in supply and demand and in the price of crude oil. In addition, the ----- price of reclaimed polyethylene material, waste wood fiber, aluminum, other additives (including modifiers, TiO2 and pigments) and other raw materials fluctuates depending on, among other things, overall market supply and demand and general business conditions. We seek to mitigate the effects of increases in raw material costs by broadening our supplier base, increasing our use of recycled material and scrap, reducing waste and exploring options for material substitution without sacrificing quality. We have long-standing relationships as well as guaranteed supply contracts with some of our key suppliers but, other than certain contracts with prices determined based on the current index price, we have no fixed-price contracts with any of our major vendors. Under our guaranteed supply contracts, the prices are either established annually based on a discount to the then-current market prices or, for purchase orders, based on market rates in effect when the orders become effective. Prices for spot market purchases are negotiated on a continuous basis in line with the market at the time. We have not entered into hedges with respect to our raw material costs at this time, but we may choose to enter into such hedges in the future.

1069,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.3,Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations,17.3.4,Product Mix,"We offer a wide variety of products across numerous product lines within our Residential and Commercial segments, and these products are sold at different prices, are composed of different materials and involve varying levels of manufacturing complexity. In any particular period, changes in the volume of particular products sold and the prices of those products relative to other products will impact our average selling price and our cost of sales. For example, the gross margins of our Residential segment significantly exceed the gross margins of our Commercial segment. In addition to the impacts attributable to product mix as between the Residential and Commercial segments, our results of operations are impacted by the relative margins associated with individual products within our Residential and Commercial segments, which vary among products. As we continue to introduce new products at varying price points to compete with products made with wood or other traditional materials across a wide range of prices, our overall gross margins may vary from period to period as a result of changes in product mix and different margins for our higher and lower price point offerings. We may choose to introduce new products with initially lower gross margins with the expectation that those margins will improve over time as we improve our manufacturing efficiency for those products. In addition, our product mix and our gross margins may be impacted by our marketing decisions in a particular period as well as the rebates and incentives that we may extend to our customers in a particular period. We also continue to seek to enhance our gross margins by improving manufacturing efficiency across our operations, including by investing in, and expanding, our recycling capabilities and implementing initiatives to more efficiently use scrap and to reduce waste. Our success in achieving margin improvements through these initiatives may vary due to changes in product mix as different products benefit to different degrees from these initiatives.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

We have typically experienced moderately higher levels of sales of our residential products in the second fiscal quarter of the year as a result of our “early buy” sales and extended payment terms typically available during the second fiscal quarter of the year. As a result of these extended payment terms, our accounts receivable have typically reached seasonal peaks at the end of the second fiscal quarter of the year, and our net cash provided by operating activities has typically been lower in the second fiscal quarter relative to in other quarters. Our sales are also generally impacted by the number of days in a quarter or a year that contractors and other professionals are able to install our products. This can vary dramatically based on, among other things, weather events such as rain, snow and extreme temperatures. We have generally experienced lower levels of sales of our residential products in the first fiscal quarter due to adverse weather conditions in certain markets, which typically reduce the construction and renovation activity during the winter season. In addition, we have experienced higher levels of sales of our bathroom partition products and our locker products during the second half of our fiscal year, which includes the summer months when schools are typically closed and therefore are more likely to undergo remodel activities.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

While the COVID-19 pandemic presents very serious concerns for our business and operations, our employees and their families, our customers and our suppliers, we believe that we are adapting well to the wide-ranging changes that the global economy is currently undergoing, and we remain confident that we will continue to maintain business continuity, produce and sell our products safely and in compliance with applicable laws and governmental orders and mandates, maintain our robust and flexible supply chains and be in a strong position to maintain financial flexibility even in the event of a potentially extended economic downturn. This discussion and analysis is with respect to periods prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. For further discussion of the steps we have taken to respond to and mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Recent Developments—COVID-19.” ----- Although we have implemented measures to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including reducing our production and expenses, we expect that these measures may not fully mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict the degree to, or the period over, which we will be affected by the pandemic and resulting governmental and other measures. We expect that demand for our products over the balance of fiscal 2020 will likely decline as a result of the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The global impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the situation closely. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the risks described in “Risk Factors” in this offering memorandum.

The key segment measures used by our chief operating decision maker in deciding how to evaluate performance and allocate resources to each of the segments are Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin. Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin are calculated differently than our Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, which are further discussed under the heading “Selected Consolidated Financial Data—Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Segment Adjusted EBITDA and Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin represent measures of segment profit reported to our chief operating decision maker for the purpose of making decisions about allocating resources to a segment and assessing its performance and are determined as disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum consistent with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 280. We define Segment Adjusted EBITDA as a segment’s net income (loss) before income tax (benefit) expense and by adding to or subtracting therefrom interest expense, net, depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation costs, asset impairment and inventory revaluation costs, business transformation costs, capital structure transaction costs, acquisition costs, initial public offering costs and certain other costs. Segment Adjusted EBITDA Margin is equal to a segment’s Segment Adjusted EBITDA divided by such segment’s net sales. Corporate expenses, which include selling, general and administrative costs related to our corporate offices, including payroll and other professional fees, are not included in computing Segment Adjusted EBITDA. Such corporate expenses increased by $1.9 million to $42.3 million during the year ended September 30, 2019, from $40.4 million during the year ended September 30, 2018, and decreased by $2.5 million to $12.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 from $14.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

The slight decrease was driven by weakness in certain end-user markets offset by growth in partitions and locker sales. _Segment Adjusted EBITDA_ Segment Adjusted EBITDA of the Commercial segment was $3.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019, compared to $3.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018.

We have, and, after this offering will continue to have, significant debt and debt service requirements. As of December 31, 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents of $22.5 million and total indebtedness of $1,121.5 million. CPG International LLC had approximately $134.6 million available under the borrowing base for future borrowings as of December 31, 2019. CPG International LLC also has the option to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement by up to $100.0 million, subject to certain conditions. In the year ended September 30, 2019, we had interest expense of $83.2 million. During the three months ended March 31, 2020, we borrowed $129.0 million under the Revolving Credit Agreement, including, on March 16, 2020, $89.0 million to enhance our financial flexibility in light of uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 31, 2020, we had approximately $16.0 million of borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Agreement. We expect to redeem the 2013 Notes with the net proceeds from this offering together with cash on hand for an aggregate amount equal to the outstanding principal amount as of December 31, 2019 of $315.0 million at par, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. We believe we will have adequate liquidity over the next 12 months to operate our business and to meet our cash requirements as a result of cash flows from operating activities, available cash balances and availability under our Revolving Credit Agreement after consideration of our debt service and other cash requirements. In the longer term, our liquidity will depend on many factors, including our results of operations, our future growth, the timing and extent of our expenditures to develop new products and improve our manufacturing capabilities, the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and the extent to which we make ----- acquisitions. Changes in our operating plans, material changes in anticipated sales, increased expenses, acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional equity and/or debt financing in future periods. _Cash Sources_ We have historically relied on cash flows from operations, borrowings under the credit facilities, issuances of notes and other forms of debt financing and capital contributions to fund our cash needs. On September 30, 2013, CPG International LLC, Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, or the Revolver Administrative Agent, and the lenders party thereto entered into the Revolving Credit Agreement. On March 9, 2017, the Revolving Credit Agreement was amended and restated to provide for maximum aggregate borrowings of up to $150.0 million, subject to an asset-based borrowing base. The borrowing base is limited to a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory, less reserves that may be established by the Revolver Administrative Agent in the exercise of its reasonable credit judgment. We are in the process of pursuing the RCA Amendment, that would increase the percentage of borrowing baseeligible assets against which we are able to borrow, thereby potentially increasing our borrowing capacity (subject to the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement). The RCA Amendment is subject to approval by our lenders. There is no assurance that we will be successful in entering into the RCA Amendment or that the RCA Amendment will substantially increase our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 and 2018, CPG International LLC had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement and had $3.0 million, $3.0 million and $3.1 million, respectively, of outstanding letters of credit held against the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, CPG International LLC had approximately $134.6 million and $113.7 million, respectively, available under the borrowing base for future borrowings in addition to cash and cash equivalents on hand of $22.5 million and $105.9 million, respectively. Because our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement depends, in part, on inventory, accounts receivable and other assets that fluctuate from time to time, the amount available under the borrowing base may not reflect actual borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement. _Cash Uses_ Our principal cash requirements have included working capital, capital expenditures, payments of principal and interest on our debt, and, if market conditions warrant, making selected acquisitions.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

The obligations under the Revolving Credit Agreement are guaranteed by CPG Newco LLC and the wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of CPG International LLC other than certain immaterial subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries. The Revolving Credit Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid in whole, or in part, in each case without premium or penalty. CPG International LLC is also required to make mandatory prepayments (i) when aggregate borrowings exceed commitments or the applicable borrowing base and (ii) during “cash dominion,” which occurs if (a) the availability under the Revolving Credit Agreement is less than the greater of (i) $12.5 million and (ii) 10% of the lesser of (x) $150.0 million and (y) the borrowing base, for five consecutive business days or (b) certain events of default have occurred and are continuing. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains affirmative covenants that are customary for financings of this type, including allowing the Revolver Administrative Agent to perform periodic field exams and appraisals to evaluate the borrowing base. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains various negative covenants, including limitations on, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of indebtedness, the incurrence of liens, dispositions, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, as well as other negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The Revolving Credit Agreement also includes a financial maintenance covenant, applicable only when the excess availability is less than the greater of (i) 10% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement and the borrowing base, and (ii) $12.5 million. In such circumstances, we would be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) for the trailing four quarters equal to at least 1.0 to 1.0; subject to our ability to make an equity cure (no more than twice in any four quarter period and up to five times over the life of the facility). As of December 31 and September 30, 2019, CPG International LLC was in compliance with the financial and nonfinancial covenants imposed by the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement also includes customary events of default, including the occurrence of a change of control. We also have the option to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement by up to $100.0 million, subject to certain conditions. We are in the process of pursuing the RCA Amendment, which would increase the percentage of borrowing base-eligible assets against which we are able to borrow, thereby potentially increasing our borrowing capacity (subject to the maximum aggregate amount that may be borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement). The RCA Amendment is subject to approval by our lenders. There is no assurance that we will be successful in entering into the RCA Amendment or that the RCA Amendment will substantially increase our borrowing capacity under the Revolving Credit Agreement.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Our Commercial segment generates revenue from the sale of sustainable low-maintenance privacy and storage solution products and highly engineered plastic sheet products. On October 1, 2018, we early adopted ASC 606, using the modified retrospective method with an adjustment to the opening balance of equity of $0.2 million, due to the cumulative impact of adopting Topic 606. The adoption of ASC 606 did not have a material impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements, and the timing and amounts of our revenue recognition is substantially unchanged as a result of this new guidance. We did not restate comparative period amounts. Therefore, the comparative information continues to be reported under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. ASC 606 includes a five-step model for contracts with customers as follows: - Identify the contract with a customer; - Identify the performance obligations in the contract; - Determine the transaction price, which is the total consideration provided by the customer; - Allocate the transaction price among the separate performance obligations within the contract; and - Recognize revenue when the performance obligations are satisfied. We recognize revenues when control of the promised goods is transferred to our customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods, at a point in time, when shipping occurs. Each product we transfer to the customer is considered one performance obligation. We have elected to account for shipping and handling costs as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods. As a result of this accounting policy election, we do not consider shipping and handling activities as promised services to our customers. Customer contracts are typically fixed price and short-term in nature. The transaction price is based on the product specifications and is determined at the time of order. We do not engage in contracts greater than one year, and therefore do not have any incremental costs capitalized as of December 31 or September 30, 2019. We may offer various sales incentive programs throughout the year. We estimate the amount of sales incentive to allocate to each performance obligation, or product shipped, using the most-likely-amount method of estimation, based on sales to the direct customer or sell-through customer. The estimate is updated each reporting period and any changes are allocated to the performance obligations on the same basis as at inception. Changes in estimate allocated to a previously satisfied performance obligation are recognized as part of net revenue in the period in which the change occurs under the cumulative catch-up method. In addition to sales incentive programs, we may offer a payment discount, if payments are received within 30 days. We estimate the payment discount that we determine will be taken by the customer based on prior history and using the most-likely-amount method of estimation. We believe the most-likely-amount method best predicts the amount of consideration to which we will be entitled. The payment discounts are also reflected as part of net revenue. The total amount of incentives was $10.3 million and $8.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and $50.8 million and $42.4 million for the years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

During fiscal 2019, we changed the annual impairment assessment date on which impairment is tested to August 1 from September 30 to align more consistently with the annual budgeting process. This change did not accelerate, delay, avoid or cause an impairment charge, nor did this change result in adjustments to any previously issued financial statements. Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. We may first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount or may elect to bypass the qualitative assessment and proceed to a quantitative assessment to determine if goodwill is impaired. In quantitative impairment tests, we first compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the goodwill of that reporting unit is impaired and an impairment loss is recognized for the excess up to the amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. We measure fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is allocated using an income based approach, a generally accepted valuation methodology, using relevant data available through and as of the impairment testing date. Under the income approach, fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. The key estimates and factors used in this approach include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts, a weighted-average cost of capital used to discount future cash flows, and a review with comparable market multiples for the industry segment as well as our historical operating trends. Any impairment is increased to encompass the income tax effects of any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit, so that the after-tax impairment loss is equivalent to the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. No impairments were recorded during the year ended September 30, 2019 as the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying value for all reporting units other than the Versatex reporting unit. We determined that the fair value of the Versatex reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 12.5% as of August 1, 2019. The Versatex reporting unit was acquired in June 2018, and, therefore, at August 1, 2019, the annual goodwill impairment test date, the fair value of the reporting unit was similar to the fair value of the reporting unit determined as of the date of acquisition in the purchase accounting process. The goodwill associated with the Versatex reporting unit was $110.4 million at September 30, 2019. In determining the fair value of our reporting units, including the Versatex reporting unit, we use the income test, as described above, which includes, among key estimates, anticipated revenue growth rates and profit margins, based on internal forecasts, as well as performance for the industry segment, all of which are subject to uncertainty. Future adverse developments relating to such matters as the growth in the market for Versatex’s products, competition, general economic conditions, the market appeal of Versatex’s products or anticipated profit margins could reduce the fair value of the Versatex reporting unit.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Amortizable intangible assets and long-lived tangible assets include customer relationships, proprietary knowledge, trademarks and property, plant and equipment. If a triggering event has occurred, recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If an impairment is indicated, an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset group exceeds its fair value.

The Profits Interests are subject to specified hurdle amounts, which function like option exercise prices because the Profits Interests do not participate in distributions by the Partnership until distributions to equity holders have exceeded the relevant hurdle amounts. In general, awards of Profits Interests are 50% time vested and 50% performance vested. In determining the fair value of the Profits Interests we took into account the methodologies and approaches described in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. The sole material asset of the Partnership is indirect ownership of our company. Accordingly, the fair value of the Profits Interests was derived by reference to the value of our company, which we estimated using a combination of the income approach and the market approach. Under the income approach, we estimated the fair value of our company based on the present value of our future estimated cash flows and the estimated residual value of our company beyond the forecast period. These future values were discounted to their present values at a discount rate deemed appropriate to reflect the risks inherent in achieving these estimated cash flows. Significant estimates and judgments involved in the income approach include our estimated future cash flows, the perpetuity growth rate assumed in estimating the residual value of our cash flows and the discount rate used to discount our cash flows to present value. For the market approach, we utilized the comparable company method by analyzing a group of companies that were considered to be comparable to us in terms of product offerings, revenue, margins and/or growth. We then used these companies to develop relevant market multiples, which were applied to our corresponding financial metrics to estimate our equity value. Significant estimates and judgments used in the comparable company method included the selection of comparable companies and the selection of appropriate market multiples. Application of these approaches involves the use of estimates, judgment and assumptions that are highly subjective. ----- In order to determine the value of the Profits Interests, the estimated equity value of the Partnership was allocated among the various interests in the Partnership, including the Profits Interests, using the option pricing method, or OPM, which treats the various interests in the Partnership as call options with exercise prices determined based on their respective rights to participate in distributions by the Partnership. The values attributable to these implicit call options were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions, including volatility and the expected term of the call options. As equity interests in the Partnership have not been publicly traded, expected volatility was derived based on the volatilities of a peer group of publicly-traded companies that were deemed to be similar to us. The expected term of the options was based on the anticipated time to liquidity. Other assumptions include the risk-free rate of interest and dividend yield. The risk-free rate of interest was based on yields for U.S. Treasury securities with remaining maturities corresponding to the estimated term of the options. Dividends were assumed to be zero, consistent with historical experience. After the equity value was determined and allocated to the various classes of interests in the Partnership, including the Profits Interests, a discount for lack of marketability, or DLOM, was applied to derive the fair value of the Profits Interests. A DLOM is meant to account for the lack of marketability of a security that is not publicly traded. The cost of time vested Profits Interests is recognized as an expense generally on a straight-line basis over the employee’s requisite service period, which generally coincides with the vesting of the award. For performance vested Profits Interests, expense will be recognized if and when the achievement of the applicable performance criteria becomes probable. Performance vested Profits Interests only vest upon receipt by the Sponsors of specified proceeds (in the form of cash and marketable securities) or, in the event of a Change of Control (as defined in the Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership of the Partnership, dated as of September 30, 2013), upon the Sponsors achieving a specified rate of return. Through September 30, 2019, no compensation expense has been reported with respect to the performance vested Profits Interest because the achievement of the performance criteria had not become probable. As of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, unrecognized compensation related to unvested performance vested Profits Interests was $11.0 million and $10.8 million, respectively. Additionally, during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and the year ended September 30, 2019, we granted certain awards that have similar performance criteria to the performance vested Profits Interests.

Liabilities associated with litigation-related loss contingencies may be substantial. Litigation contingencies require estimates and judgments based on our knowledge of the facts and circumstances surrounding each matter and the advice of our legal counsel.

1069,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.20,"Critical Accounting Policies, Estimates and Assumptions",17.20.11,Income Taxes,"In determining our current income tax provision, we assessed temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes. These differences resulted in deferred tax assets and liabilities which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheets. When we maintain deferred tax assets, we must assess the likelihood that these assets will be recovered through adjustments to future taxable income. To the extent we believe, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the asset will not be realized, we establish a valuation allowance. We record an allowance reducing the asset to a value we believe is more likely than not to be realized based on our expectation of future taxable income. We believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation allowance is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period as it requires management to make assumptions about our future income over the lives of the deferred tax assets, and the impact of increasing or decreasing the valuation allowance is potentially material to our results of operations. Forecasting future income requires us to use a significant amount of judgment. In estimating future income, we use our internal operating budgets and long-range planning projections. We developed our budgets and long-range projections based on recent results, trends, economic and industry forecasts influencing our segments’ performance, our backlog, planned timing of new product launches, and customer sales projections. Significant changes in the expected realization of net deferred tax assets would require that we adjust the valuation allowance, resulting in a change to net income. ----- On December 22, 2017, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Tax Act. The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the Code, including, but not limited to, the following items that impact the U.S. taxation of our income: (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (2) providing for the full expensing of qualified property; (3) revising the limitation imposed on deductions for executive compensation paid by publicly-traded companies; (4) imposing a new limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense; and (5) changing the rules related to the uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. The Tax Act’s changes with respect to the deductibility of business interest expense and the utilization of net operating losses were further changed as a result of the CARES Act. As a result of the Tax Act, our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities were remeasured as of December 22, 2017, at the enacted rate of 21%. The impact of remeasuring the deferred tax assets and liabilities reduced our net deferred tax liability by approximately $22.5 million. As a result, we recorded a net benefit of approximately $22.5 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2018 as a result of the Tax Act. This amount is included in income tax benefit in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss). We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the CARES Act to our business. We record liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is recognition, where we evaluate whether an individual tax position has a likelihood of greater than 50% of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. For tax positions that are currently estimated to have a less than 50% likelihood of being sustained, no tax benefit is recorded. For tax positions that have met the recognition threshold in the first step, we perform the second step of measuring the benefit (expense) to be recorded. The actual benefits (expense) ultimately realized may differ from our estimates. In future periods, changes in facts, circumstances, and new information may require us to change the recognition and measurement estimates with regard to individual tax positions. Changes in recognition and measurement estimates are recorded in the consolidated statement of income and consolidated balance sheet in the period in which such changes occur. As of December 31 and September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018, we had liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits pertaining to uncertain tax positions totaling $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

The update requires that inventory be measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. The adoption of this amendment did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On October 1, 2017, we adopted ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments. The update clarifies the classification of certain cash receipts and payments in the statement of cash flows. Application of the new guidance required reclassification of certain cash flows within operating activities to investing and financing activities on our consolidated statement of cash flows. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On October 1, 2018, we early adopted ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The update will supersede most current revenue recognition guidance. Under the new standard, entities are required to identify the contract with a customer; identify the separate performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and recognize the appropriate amount of revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies each performance obligation. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. On October 1, 2019, we adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other Than Inventory. The standard amends several aspects of the tax accounting and recognition timing for intra-company transfers.

In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842), deferring the adoption date for private entities by an additional year. Therefore, the standard is effective for private entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early application continues to be allowed. The standard requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.

ASU No. 2018-11 provides the option to initially apply ASU No. 2016-02 at the adoption date with a cumulative-effect adjustment to ----- the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption, instead of applying the new guidance retrospectively for each prior reporting period presented. We anticipate adopting the standard using the option provided by ASU 2018-11 and are evaluating the impact of the adoption of these ASU’s on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13- Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326). This ASU sets forth an expected credit loss model which requires the measurement of expected credit losses for financial instruments based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This ASU is effective for us for the year ending September 30, 2022 and interim reporting periods beginning October 1, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. We intend to adopt the updated standard during the year ended September 30, 2022. Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition. We are currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on our Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-05, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), which provided certain improvements to ASU No. 2016-13. The amendments provide entities that have certain instruments within the scope of Subtopic 32620, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses—Measured at Amortized Cost, with an option to irrevocably elect the fair value option in Subtopic 825-10, Financial Instruments—Overall, applied on an instrument-by-instrument basis for eligible instruments, upon adoption of Topic 326. The fair value option election does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. An entity that elects the fair value option should subsequently apply the guidance in Subtopics 820-10, Fair Value Measurement—Overall, and 825-10. For entities that have adopted the amendments in ASU No. 2016-13, the amendments in ASU No. 2019-05 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted in any interim period after the issuance of ASU No. 2019-05 as long as an entity has adopted the amendments in ASU No. 2016-13.

One material weakness related to the design and maintenance of an effective control environment, one material weakness related to the design and maintenance of formal accounting policies, procedures and controls, and one material weakness related to the design and maintenance of effective controls over certain information technology general controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. See “Risk Factors—We have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If our remediation of these material weaknesses is not effective, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately or timely report our financial condition or results of operations or investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports.” Each of the material weaknesses described above involve control deficiencies that could result in a misstatement of one or more account balances or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement to the annual or interim consolidated financial ----- statements that would not be prevented or detected, and, accordingly, we determined that these control deficiencies constitute material weaknesses. We remediated a previous material weakness related to our lack of policies, procedures and internal controls over non-routine or complex transactions during fiscal 2019. We remediated this material weakness by designing and implementing the following controls and procedures: - We enhanced controls and documentation related to the review of significant assumptions utilized in the assessment of goodwill impairment and valuation of business combinations. - We designed and implemented controls for management’s review of models utilized in the assessment of goodwill impairment and valuation of business combinations. - We enhanced controls and documentation related to the review of the completeness and accuracy of computations performed by third party appraisers. Based on our evaluation, the above controls and procedures were determined to be operating effectively for a reasonable period of time. We are currently in the process of implementing measures and taking steps to address the underlying causes of the remaining material weaknesses yet to be remediated. Our efforts to date have included the following: - We hired finance and accounting personnel with prior work experience in finance and accounting departments of public companies and with technical accounting, financial controls and SEC reporting experience, including the hiring of our Chief Financial Officer in January 2019 and our Chief Accounting Officer in April 2019. We have also reorganized our finance department to place finance personnel in line with our operating functions and to improve internal control over business processes and IT operations. - Although we have not remediated the material weaknesses related to the maintenance of an effective control environment and related to the design and maintenance of formal policies, procedures and internal controls, we have designed and are currently implementing formal accounting policies and procedures, training on standards of documentary evidence, as well as implementing additional controls to ensure the reliability of critical spreadsheets and system-generated reports. - Specifically, we have designed and implemented the following as part of our ongoing remediation efforts: We formalized and issued accounting policies and position papers covering critical accounting areas. We risk ranked business process controls for remediation to address higher priority areas first. We strengthened controls related to review of account reconciliations, journal entries and balance sheet and income statement fluctuation analysis. We enhanced controls related to the consolidation of financial information of all of our operating companies. We provided training to strengthen process documentation and evidence of control operation, as well as precision of review controls. - To complete our remediation plan, we will perform testing to confirm that such controls are designed and operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. - Although we have not remediated the material weakness related to the design and maintenance of effective controls over certain information technology general controls, we have designed and are currently implementing an IT general controls framework that addresses risks associated with user access and security, application change management and IT operations; focused training for control owners to help sustain effective control operations; and comprehensive remediation efforts relating to segregation of duties to strengthen user access security. - Specifically, we have designed and implemented the following as part of our ongoing remediation: ----- We have risk ranked segregation of duties conflicts within our core financial system, remediated the highest priority conflicts and, where necessary, identified and validated mitigating controls. We enhanced and implemented user administration processes that manage how we grant, modify, and remove user access to our financial applications. We completed a comprehensive review of privileged user access across our financial applications to confirm that access rights are restricted to authorized users based on business need. We enhanced and implemented processes for managing changes to our financial applications (including controls that require all changes to be formally submitted, approved, tested and migrated to production by authorized users) as well as over program development. We enhanced and implemented processes over our computer operations that restrict access to and continually monitor production batch jobs that support our financial reporting applications. - To complete our IT general controls remediation plan we will perform testing to confirm that such controls are operating effectively. While we believe these efforts will improve our internal controls and address the underlying causes of the three remaining material weaknesses, such material weaknesses will not be remediated until our remediation plan has been fully implemented and we have concluded that our controls are operating effectively for a sufficient period of time. We cannot be certain that the steps we are taking will be sufficient to remediate the control deficiencies that led to our material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or prevent future material weaknesses or control deficiencies from occurring. In addition, we cannot be certain that we have identified all material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, or that in the future we will not have additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

The primary raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products are various petrochemical resins, including polyethylene, polypropylene and PVC resins, reclaimed polyethylene and PVC material, waste wood fiber and aluminum. In addition, we utilize a variety of other additives including modifiers, TiO2 and pigments. The exposures associated with these costs are primarily managed through terms of the sales and by maintaining relationships with multiple vendors. Prices for spot market purchases are negotiated on a continuous basis in line with the market at the time. We have not entered into hedges with respect to our raw material costs at this time, but we may choose to enter into such hedges in the future. Other than short term supply contracts for resins with indexed based pricing and occasional strategic purchases of larger quantities of certain raw materials, we generally buy materials on an as-needed basis. The cost of some of the raw materials we use in the manufacture of our products is subject to significant price volatility. For example, the cost of petrochemical resins used in our manufacturing processes has historically varied significantly and has been affected by changes in supply and demand and in the price of crude oil. Substantially all of our resins are purchased under supply contracts that average approximately one to two years, for which pricing is variable based on an industry benchmark price index. The resin supply contracts are negotiated annually and generally provide that we are obligated to purchase a minimum amount of resins from each supplier.

Homeowners are continuing to invest in their outdoor spaces and are increasingly recognizing the significant advantages of long-lasting products, which are converting demand away from traditional materials, particularly wood. Our products transform those outdoor spaces by combining highly appealing aesthetics with significantly lower maintenance costs compared to traditional materials. Our innovative portfolio of Outdoor Living products, including deck, rail, trim and accessories, inspires consumers to design outdoor spaces tailored to their unique lifestyle needs. We are well known in the industry, and, according to data provided by Principia, we generally hold one of the top two market share positions by revenue in our product categories. In addition to our leading suite of Outdoor Living products, we sell a broad range of highly engineered products that are sold in commercial markets, including partitions, lockers and storage solutions. One of our core values is to “always do the right thing”. We make decisions according to what is right, not what is the cheapest, fastest or easiest, and we strive to always operate with integrity, transparency and with the customer in mind. In furtherance of that value, we are focused on sustainability across our operations and have adopted strategies to enable us to meet the growing demand for environmentally-friendly products. Our businesses leverage a shared material technology and U.S.-based manufacturing platform to create products that convert demand from traditional materials to those that are long lasting and low maintenance, fulfilling our brand commitment to deliver products that are “Beautifully Engineered to Last”. Our Residential segment product portfolio is highly complementary and allows us to provide a wide-ranging solutions set to Outdoor Living projects. Our primary consumer brands in our Residential segment, TimberTech and AZEK, are recognized by contractors and consumers for their premium aesthetics, uncompromising quality and performance and for their diversity of style and design options. In our Commercial segment, we manufacture engineered sheet products and high-quality bathroom partitions and lockers. Over our history, we have developed a reputation as a leading innovator in our markets by leveraging our differentiated manufacturing capabilities, material science expertise and product management proficiency to consistently introduce new products into the market. This long-standing commitment to innovation has been critical to our ability to stay at the forefront of evolving industry trends and consumer demands, which in turn has allowed us to become a market leader across our core product categories. Our focus on new product development, material science and R&D enables us to capitalize on favorable secular growth trends that are accelerating material conversion from traditional materials such as wood, to sustainable, low-maintenance engineered materials, and to expand our markets. We believe our core competency of consistently launching new products into the market, combined with our recent investments in sales, marketing, R&D and manufacturing, will continue to solidify our incumbent position as a market leader and enable us to generate long term demand for our products through economic cycles. Over our 30-year history, we have introduced numerous disruptive products and demonstrated our ability to drive material conversion and extend our portfolio, addressing consumer needs across a wide range of price segments. In fiscal 2015, we introduced our Vintage premium decking collection, and through fiscal 2019, sales for these products, including new colors introduced in fiscal 2018 and variable widths introduced in fiscal 2019, have increased at a CAGR of more than 50.0% per year. The extended success of the Vintage premium decking collection demonstrates the longevity of demand for our product portfolio. We have leveraged the strong consumer response to Vintage to expand the platform with the introduction of new designs that address evolving industry trends and consumer demands. Our material science expertise and differentiated R&D capabilities enable us to create award-winning products and back them with some of the industry’s longest warranties, such as the 50-year fade & stain warranty that we offer on our TimberTech AZEK decking product line. Most of our product categories are in the early growth stage of their life cycles, and we anticipate that they will continue to benefit from substantial material conversion over the long term. We have created an operating platform that is centered around sustainability, one of our core strategic pillars, which extends across our value chain from product design to raw material sourcing and manufacturing, and we increasingly utilize plastic waste, recycled wood and scrap in our products. We have also made significant recent investments in our recycling capabilities, including our recent acquisition of Return Polymers, which further enhance the sustainability of our manufacturing operations and reduce our costs. In fiscal 2019, we utilized more than 200 million pounds of recycled materials in our deck boards, and we expect to increase the amount of recycled materials used in our deck boards by over 25% in fiscal 2020. In addition, we believe we have the opportunity to further increase the amount of recycled material used in our products. In fiscal 2019, we opened a new 100,000 square foot recycling facility that utilizes advanced technologies to transform a broad range of plastic waste into raw material used in our products. Today, our TimberTech PRO and EDGE decking lines offer high-quality products made from approximately 80% recycled material. Through our recycling programs, approximately 290 million pounds of waste and scrap were diverted from landfills in fiscal 2019. Furthermore, approximately 98% of scrap generated is re-used, and the majority of our TimberTech, AZEK Exteriors and Versatex products are recyclable at the end of their useful lives. In addition to the sustainability advantages and cost benefits of our vertically ----- integrated in-house manufacturing operations, our supplier base is located primarily in the U.S., making us less susceptible to trade disruptions or supply chain dislocations resulting from extended crises such as COVID-19. Within our Residential segment, we sell our products through a national network of more than 4,200 dealers, more than 35 distributors and multiple home improvement retailers providing extensive geographic coverage, enabling us to effectively serve contractors across the United States and Canada. Our geographic breadth, combined with our extensive market knowledge and broad product portfolio, positions us to continue to accelerate our growth within the industry. Our customer-focused sales organization generates pull-through demand for our products by driving increased downstream engagement directly with consumers and key influencers such as architects, builders and contractors, and by focusing on strengthening our position with dealers and growing our presence in retail. We have been investing in our consumer brands, marketing campaigns and digital tools in order to strengthen our relationships with consumers and key influencers, many of whom serve as advocates of our brands. Within our Commercial segment, we sell our products through a broad distribution network as well as directly to OEMs. Through our Residential and Commercial segments, we deliver market-focused product solutions that drive material conversion. We have experienced strong growth over our history, and over the last several years we have made significant investments in our business to further accelerate our growth and increase our profitability.

Our growth over this period reflects the contribution to net sales of acquisitions, including the acquisitions of VAST Enterprises and TimberTech in fiscal 2012 and Ultralox and Versatex in fiscal 2018. (3) We define Five Year New Product Vitality as the percentage of gross sales in fiscal 2019 derived from products first introduced in fiscal 2019 and the four preceding years, excluding gross sales from Versatex and Ultralox.

1069,Offerings 2020.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.26,Industry Overview,17.26.1,,"Our products are widely used across several large, attractive markets, including residential and commercial end markets. We primarily serve the Outdoor Living market, which we define as the market for decks, rail, trim, wood and wood-look siding, porches, pavers, outdoor furniture, outdoor cabinetry and outdoor lighting designed to enhance the utility and improve the aesthetics of outdoor living spaces. We expect the Outdoor Living market will continue to benefit from increased investment as homeowners choose to spend more leisure time outdoors. As more members of the Millennial generation purchase first homes in the United States, we expect the demand for outdoor living spaces will rise, and the appeal of low- to no-maintenance features to gain further momentum. We ----- believe that consumers are increasingly environmentally-conscious in their purchasing behaviors, and that our sustainable manufacturing practices and the high recycled content of our products address evolving consumer preferences. The primary products that we sell into the Outdoor Living market are composite deck, composite and aluminum rail and PVC trim. Based on data provided by Principia, the total U.S. market sales of these products were $7.2 billion in 2018, grew at a 6.3% CAGR from 2014 to 2018 on a linear foot basis and are expected to grow at a 3.0% CAGR from 2018 to 2022 on a linear foot basis to $8.3 billion in 2022. By material type, based on data provided by Principia, the total U.S. market sales of composite deck, composite and aluminum rail and PVC trim products are expected to grow at a 5.7% CAGR from 2018 to 2022, compared to deck, rail and trim manufactured from wood which are expected to grow at a 2.7% CAGR and to deck, rail and trim manufactured from other materials, such as engineered wood, vinyl and other metals, which are expected to grow at a 1.4% CAGR, in each case measured in terms of linear feet. In addition, based on data provided by Freedonia, the total U.S. market sales of wood and wood-look siding, pavers, outdoor furniture and outdoor lighting were $10.9 billion in 2018, and, when combined with the total U.S. market sales of deck, rail and trim, according to Principia, in 2018, totaled $18.1 billion in 2018. Source: 2018 and 2022 projected market sizes based on data provided by Principia. (1) Represents total market (all materials). Principia market definition for trim excludes specialty exteriors products, such as tongue and groove profiles, sheets, sills, thresholds and column wraps. (2) Decking category includes composite and PVC decking, rail category includes composite and aluminum rail and trim category includes PVC trim. Based on data provided by Principia, there were approximately 57 million decks in the United States as of 2018, of which approximately 5.0 million were built in 2018, up from approximately 4.0 million in 2014, representing a CAGR of 5.9%. Decking, our single largest product category, represents a significant opportunity for homeowners to extend the total livable space of their home and to design a unique space for relaxation and entertainment. Through our portfolio of Outdoor Living products, we provide a broad range of material and design options to homeowners as they tailor their outdoor living space to their unique lifestyle. In addition, we believe that we have significant opportunities to leverage our material science expertise, brand awareness and channel relationships to expand into additional segments of the Outdoor Living market. We believe that the current COVID-19 crisis, which has caused people to spend an extended amount of time at home, could be an additional catalyst that may cause an increasing number of homeowners to further identify the benefits that our portfolio of Outdoor Living products can offer. We believe our products offer a compelling value proposition due to their enhanced durability, quality, attractive aesthetics and lower life-cycle costs relative to traditional materials such as wood. For example, we estimate the total lifecycle cost of our new TimberTech EDGE Prime decking, including materials, labor and annual maintenance, is approximately 37% less expensive over its 25-year warranty period than the cost of a comparable pressure treated lumber deck. Further, given that the cost of our TimberTech EDGE Prime decking products typically constitutes approximately 15% of the total deck project installation cost, consumers have the opportunity to cost-effectively upgrade to our long-lasting, low maintenance materials by replacing traditional deck boards with our product while utilizing an existing substructure that has been appropriately maintained. Composite deck (which includes wood composite and PVC decking), rail and trim products have continued to increase market share relative to other materials, due to their superior product qualities. Based on data provided by Principia, between 2014 and 2018, composite deck, composite and aluminum rail and PVC trim products collectively grew at a CAGR of 8.7% as compared to deck, rail and trim manufactured from wood, which grew at a CAGR of 5.9%, in each case measured in terms of linear feet. We believe the market for composite products will continue to increase at an above-market growth rate as it benefits from material conversion. Based on data provided by Principia, wood represented approximately 65% of the total U.S. deck, rail and trim markets ----- based on 2018 linear feet sold. With respect to the individual components of these markets, based on this data, composite deck represented approximately 18% of the decking market, composite and aluminum rail represented approximately 16% of the rail market and PVC trim products represented approximately 11% of the trim market, each in terms of linear feet. (1) Based on data provided by Principia. Other includes (A) hollow vinyl, plastic lumber and metal for decking, (B) iron, stainless steel, hollow vinyl and other plastic for railing and (C) engineered wood, fiber cement, vinyl, other polymer composite and other for trim. (2) Wood for the decking market includes premium hardwoods, cedar and redwood, which accounted for approximately 13% of the total decking market in 2018 according to data provided by Principia. We believe there is a significant opportunity for further market penetration by composite products as consumer awareness towards sustainable materials increases and advances in material science and manufacturing improve the range of colors and textures available. We offer products that reduce the relative premium between composite and other materials to increase the affordability and further improve the lifetime value advantages of composite products. In addition, we believe our products are well positioned to benefit from growth across economic cycles given their low market penetration and improving cost and value proposition. We believe that we have been, and will continue to be, a driving force behind the growth of low-maintenance products in our markets. Our engineered deck, trim, rail and accessory products are sold through both one-step and two-step distribution channels. Within our Residential segment, we sell our products to distributors, professional dealers and home improvement retailers, who in turn sell our products to builders, contractors and homeowners. Based on data provided by Principia, the relative industry volumes of composite deck, composite and aluminum rail and PVC trim products sold by distribution channel and by end user channel are as follows: (1) Rail includes composite and aluminum rail. We are a leader within the professional dealer channel due to our depth across product categories, brand reputation and the superior quality of our products. We estimate that our U.S. decking sales represented approximately 34% of total composite decking ----- sales in 2018 and that our U.S. trim sales represented approximately 36% of total PVC trim sales in 2018, in each case within the professional dealer channel. Based on data provided by Principia, in 2018, the retail channel represented approximately 35% of the total $3.1 billion decking market, and, within that channel, composite decking sales represented approximately $0.3 billion. We estimate approximately half of all composite decking sales through that retail channel were special order products. Although less than 10% of our Residential segment sales were directly through home improvement retailers, we have seen substantial year-over-year growth in special order sales through such retailers, resulting in a CAGR of such gross sales of over 20% between fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2019. We believe we have an opportunity for significant expansion within retail and that this channel represents a key area of potential growth for us in the future. Our Commercial segment sells its products to OEMs and through distribution channels that reach a number of end markets including education, industrial, commercial and marine.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Based on data provided by Principia, wood represented approximately 65% of the total U.S. deck, rail and trim markets as measured by linear feet sold in 2018. Within the decking market specifically, wood represented approximately 80% of the total decking market in 2018, with premium hardwoods, cedar and redwood comprising 13% of the total decking market. We believe these markets present substantial growth opportunities in the coming years and that our leading scale, vertically-integrated manufacturing capabilities and extensive material science expertise position us to capitalize on these highly attractive markets as material conversion continues. In addition, we believe that the residential repair and remodel market, which is the primary market served by our core products, is significantly more resilient through economic cycles than the home building industry. For example, from 2007 to 2009, single family housing starts declined approximately 57% according to the U.S. Census Bureau, while the home improvement products market declined approximately 14% according to the Home Improvement Research Institute. Moreover, our business demonstrated resilience through this period as net sales declined approximately 15% and cash flows from operations remained positive and increased through this period as a result of product mix, lower raw material costs and working capital management. In addition, even during periods of industry decline, we believe many home improvement projects are deferred rather than permanently cancelled, making it possible for industry activity to rebound relatively quickly. We have increased our focus on serving the residential repair and remodel market over time, and we estimate that, within our Residential segment, over 85% of our net sales are attributable to repair and remodel activity. Based on data provided by Principia, in 2018, approximately 95% of total decking, 80% of rail and 65% of trim sales were attributable to the residential repair and remodel market. Our markets are also experiencing multiple favorable longterm secular growth trends. For example, within our Residential segment, consumers increasingly spend their leisure time outdoors and demand products that expand the usable living space of their home and enhance their outdoor lifestyle. In addition, according to a 2019 survey by the American Institute of Architects, outdoor living spaces have ranked as the most popular space amongst residential architects over the past two years and continue to increase in popularity. As a result, we believe our business will continue to benefit from strong material conversion, continued repair and remodel activity and favorable secular trends.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

We believe these factors, combined with some of the industry’s longest warranties and a comprehensive range of on-trend color palettes and styles, drive contractor loyalty and offer a compelling choice for consumers looking to reinvent their outdoor living spaces and the exteriors of their homes. In fiscal 2019, our Residential segment generated net sales of $655.4 million, representing approximately 83% of our total net sales. Demand for our Residential segment products is largely driven by repair and remodel activity, which we estimate accounted for over 85% of our Residential segment net sales in fiscal 2019, with the remaining sales attributable to new construction activity. ----- TimberTech PRO Legacy Deck Collection with Impression Rail (Deck Colors: Tigerwood and Pecan) _Decking_ We are one of the only decking manufacturers to offer both capped wood composite and PVC decking products, and we believe we are the only manufacturer to offer narrow and wide-width PVC deck boards. Our decking products transform consumers’ outdoor areas into aesthetically appealing spaces, while reducing lifetime maintenance costs as compared to those made with traditional materials. These high-quality, innovative products are artfully crafted with a broad range of design options and distinguishing features, such as cascading or variegated tones to emulate the natural look and finish of wood. Our products are long lasting and often a more cost-effective alternative over time than products made of traditional materials such as wood, which can fade quickly, require frequent sanding, staining and maintenance and are prone to rot, splinter and crack. In addition, our decking products span a wide range of entry-level to premium price points and are covered by some of the industry’s longest warranties. We are also committed to sustainability and to manufacturing our products with recycled waste and scrap. The wood used in the core of our decking products is 100% recycled, and we do not use any virgin timber. We continue to expand our use of recycled materials in our decking products, such as in our TimberTech PRO and EDGE decking product lines, which offer products made from approximately 80% recycled material. Through our three primary decking product lines – TimberTech AZEK, TimberTech PRO and TimberTech EDGE – we offer a broad range of colors, textures and styles to provide consumers with a myriad of design options at a variety of price points. ----- Our decking product lines are complemented by our porch collection as well as our broad range of deck accessories, including in-deck and riser lighting, risers for use on stairs, fascia, end coating, flashing and joist tape and our new TimberTech Deck Cleaner. Our growing portfolio of porch board products leverages the same materials and production technologies as our industryleading decking products and allows us to deliver similar design aesthetics and low-maintenance benefits across a variety of textures. Our composite pavers provide a lightweight and easy-to-install alternative to traditional pavers and are available in a variety of colors and styles for landscaping and resurfacing. We offer a broad range of high-quality fasteners that enable an efficient installation, safe fastening and superior aesthetics, including traditional fasteners, which are color-matched to the decking product and are offered in both coated carbon steel and stainless steel; concealed fasteners, which are covered with a color-matching cap to blend into the associated decking product; and hidden fasteners, which are fastened out of sight under the decking boards. ----- _Railing_ Our railing solutions enable consumers to accent their outdoor living spaces with attractive, high-quality, low-maintenance composite and aluminum railing products, which we offer through our TimberTech and ULTRALOX brands. Our railing products reduce the need for ongoing maintenance by eliminating many of the major functional disadvantages of traditional materials, such as warping and rust, and thus are often a more cost-effective alternative over time. For example, our TimberTech composite railing products are covered by a four-sided cap, which eliminates the need for annual sanding, staining, sealing and painting, and our TimberTech aluminum railing products feature a powder coated surface, which produces a long-lasting, color-durable, moistureresistant finish. Our railing products are available in various materials and in a broad range of colors, finishes and styles, including traditional, modern and minimalist designs, and we offer a wide selection of infill options, such as composite and aluminum balusters, cable rails and glass channel kits. Our aluminum railing products are lighter-weight and easier to install than other metal railing materials, and their sleek, minimalistic designs allow unobstructed views, especially when coupled with a glass or cable infill option. Due in part to these attributes, aluminum railing has been the fastest growing material category of railing products in recent years. Our railing products are diverse and highly customizable, and in addition to complementing our decking product lines, they also appeal to a broader, stand-alone market, such as for use on decks constructed from traditional materials and in commercial applications. We believe we are particularly well positioned to serve the fast growing aluminum railing market following our 2017 acquisition of Ultralox, which significantly expanded our aluminum railing product capabilities. Using Ultralox’s proprietary Interlocking Machine, a dealer or contractor can create a customized aluminum, pre-panelized, interlocking railing system on site. This facilitates faster and easier assembly and installation without special tools, mechanical fasteners or welding for both residential and commercial applications and overcomes the design limitations of pre-fabricated railing products. Our TimberTech brand also sells a pre-panelized version of the Ultralox railing kit branded as Impression Rail Express. ----- To complement our railing products, we offer an array of functional and decorative accessories, including mounting posts, underrail lights and lighted island caps and gate kits. Our deck, rail and related accessory products are frequently used in combination in order to enable consumers to create their own highly customized outdoor living spaces. _Trim and Moulding_ We are the leading designer and manufacturer of PVC trim and moulding products for the Outdoor Living market. We operate two large PVC trim manufacturing plants and offer a diverse portfolio of PVC trim and moulding products through our AZEK Exteriors and VERSATEX brands. Our trim and moulding products are aesthetically similar to wood, and can be easily milled, routed or shaped for use in almost any application. Our products are moisture- and insect-resistant and are more durable and require less maintenance than traditional wood products. Contractors and homeowners can use our products in conventional applications, to express their creativity through unique home exteriors, and to complement our decking and railing products. For example, two story decks are often paired with column wraps, canvas porch ceilings and other trim and moulding accents. Our trim and moulding products are also increasingly utilized within the home, including as wainscot trim or as shiplap, which originated to protect the exteriors of homes in harsh climates, but is now a popular way to create unique interior spaces. Our products are also used by millshops and OEM fabricators, who rely on our products due to their consistent formulation, dimensional accuracy and precision, and high machinability, to manufacture a wide range of other Outdoor Living products such as pergolas, arbors and flowerbeds. In 2018, we acquired Versatex, which significantly expanded our existing trim product portfolio with a broad range of premium cellular PVC trim and moulding products. It also complements our established PVC trim and moulding capabilities with an organization dedicated to service, customer responsiveness and innovation. Particularly known for its customer-focused approach, Versatex has differentiated itself through its history of quickly addressing special requests from customers, developing cutting-edge products that focus on the needs of builders, architects, fabricators and consumers and rapidly bringing these innovative new products to market. ----- Our full line of AZEK Exteriors and VERSATEX products include trim and moulding, fabricated products, paintable trim and specialty solutions:",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Additionally, we have special order and stocking relationships with certain home improvement retailers. We attempt to drive sales to our dealers and retailers through digital tools and extensive marketing directed at consumers who can help create pull-through demand for our products among influencers and decision makers such as architects, builders and contractors. Our dealers typically exhibit high brand loyalty and are incentivized to consolidate the manufacturers from which they purchase to maximize early buy discounts and annual volume rebates.

Our sales organization is primarily focused on generating downstream demand with contractors, architects and builders as well as maintaining relationships with and educating influencers. We believe we can continue to leverage our downstream investments to accelerate material conversion in our markets, strengthen our position in the pro channel and enhance our retail presence. We maintain a national sales organization that works with builders and supports certain national or large regional dealers with multiple locations and/or buying groups to provide a single point of contact and more effectively serve these customers. Our national sales organization is focused on increased penetration into these accounts by working with corporate decision makers and with buyers at the local level. We have also enhanced our retail-focused sales team, who is focused on supporting individual retail locations, training pro desk associates within retail locations and facilitating deliveries for special orders placed at home improvement retailers. In 2019, we unified our decking and railing product portfolio under our leading TimberTech brand with a differentiated “Go Against the Grain” marketing campaign. TimberTech has strong market awareness, and unifying our deck and rail products under the TimberTech brand allows us to highlight product differentiation, while maintaining brand identity across multiple price points. Following the repositioning of our AZEK decking product lines under the TimberTech brand, we are focusing on leveraging the AZEK brand as our exteriors brand due to the significant brand recognition for AZEK trim and moulding products. We maintain comprehensive marketing campaigns using various media in support of our brands, targeted towards our growing dealer base, as well as architects, builders, remodelers and consumers. We continue to invest in our marketing organization and alongside our channel partners to increase consumer awareness and preference for our products. Our focused digital strategy, enhanced media presence and differentiated marketing campaigns drive increased engagement with consumers as well as key influencers such as architects, builders and contractors. Our new digital platform facilitates the consumer journey from inspiration and design through installation.

We enjoy strong preference for our products among contractors, who typically purchase our products at dealers, and we are investing in order to increase our presence within retailers as the majority of consumers include visits to home improvement retailers in their research of deck products. These consumer engagement strategies are focused on creating additional pull-through demand and accelerating our growth.

We also utilize other additives, including modifiers, TiO2 and pigments. Our contracts with key suppliers are typically short term in nature, with terms generally ranging from one to three years. We have not entered into hedges of our raw material costs at this time, but we may choose to enter into such hedges in the future, and our supply contracts with our major vendors do not contain obligations to sell raw materials to us at a fixed price. Prices for spot market purchases are negotiated on a continuous basis in line with current market prices. Other than short term supply contracts for resins with indexed based pricing and occasional strategic purchases of larger quantities of certain raw materials, we generally buy materials on an as-needed basis. The cost of petrochemical resins used in our manufacturing processes has historically varied significantly and has been affected by changes in supply and demand and in the price of crude oil. Substantially all of our resins are purchased under supply contracts that average approximately one to two years, for which pricing is variable based on an industry benchmark price index. The resin supply contracts are negotiated annually and generally provide that we are obligated to purchase a minimum amount of resins from each supplier. In addition, the price of reclaimed polyethylene material, waste wood fiber, aluminum, other additives (including modifiers, TiO2 and pigments) and other raw materials fluctuates depending on, among other things, overall market supply and demand and general economic conditions. We seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in our raw material costs by broadening our supplier base, increasing our use of recycled material, increasing our use of scrap and reducing waste and exploring options for material substitution without sacrificing quality. For example, since fiscal 2017, we have invested over $28 million to enhance our recycling capabilities and have increased our use of “regrind,” through the collection and reprocessing of scrap generated in our manufacturing processes. These investments, along with other recycling and substitution initiatives, have contributed to an approximately 15% reduction in our per pound capped composite decking core costs and an approximately 12% reduction in our per pound PVC decking core costs, in each case from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2019, and we believe we have an opportunity to achieve further cost reductions. ----- Although we do not rely on any single supplier for the majority of our raw materials, we do obtain certain raw materials from single or a limited number of suppliers. In particular, we rely on a single supplier for certain critical capped compounds used in our deck and railing products. If one or more suppliers were unable to satisfy our requirements for particular raw materials, we believe alternative sources of supply would be available, although we could experience a disruption to our operations as alternative suppliers are identified and qualified and new supply arrangements are entered into.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

This commitment is evident through our continued effort to introduce sustainable products, products with life spans that are significantly longer than the life spans of the traditional materials they replace (including exotic hardwoods cut from rainforests) with very little need for maintenance or cleaning chemicals, products that reduce deforestation and products that are versatile and recyclable at the end of their useful lives. We estimate that since 2015 more than one million trees have been saved because our customers chose our decking products over wood. The wood used in the core of our composite decking products is 100% recycled from sources that include, but are not limited to, facilities that manufacture wood mouldings, flooring, windows, doors and other products. Through our recycling programs, approximately 290 million pounds of scrap and waste were diverted from landfills in fiscal 2019. In addition to the sustainability of our products, we have implemented energy-efficient manufacturing processes in our business operations. For example, our facilities in Wilmington, OH and Scranton, PA employ closed-loop water filtration systems that recycle approximately 96% of water used annually, and our polyethylene recycling facility utilizes energy-efficient systems for power, water, heating, cooling and lighting. Our dedication to expanding our recycling capabilities and to increasing the use of reclaimed materials is also a critical part of our sustainability commitment. Approximately 44% of all of our extruded materials were manufactured from recycled materials in fiscal 2019. We expect this percentage to increase to approximately 54% in fiscal 2020, and we believe there is an opportunity to increase this percentage in the future. Currently, AZEK pavers are made from approximately 95% recycled material, and we estimate that approximately every 500 square feet of AZEK pavers diverts up to 250 passenger vehicle tires and 7,500 plastic containers from landfills. Additionally, through Vycom, we sell effectively 100% post-consumer recycled polymer sheet products used in the manufacturing of outdoor furniture.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

We have typically experienced moderately higher levels of sales of our residential products in the second fiscal quarter of the year as a result of our “early buy” sales and extended payment terms typically available during the second fiscal quarter of the year. As a result of these extended payment terms, our accounts receivable have typically reached seasonal peaks at the end of the second fiscal quarter of the year, and our net cash provided by operating activities has typically been lower in the second fiscal quarter relative to other quarters. In addition, our sales are affected by the individual decisions of distributors and dealers on the levels of inventory they carry, their views on product demand, their financial condition and the manner in which they choose to manage inventory risk. Our sales are also generally impacted by the number of days in a quarter or a year that contractors and other professionals are able to install our products. This can vary dramatically based on, among other things, weather events such as rain, snow and extreme temperatures. We have generally experienced lower levels of sales of our residential products in the first fiscal quarter due to adverse weather conditions in certain markets, which typically reduces the construction and renovation activity during the winter season. In addition, we have experienced higher levels of sales of bathroom partition products and our locker products during the second half of our fiscal year, which includes the summer months during which schools are typically closed and are more likely to undergo remodel activities.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

These laws, regulations and ordinances, among other matters, govern activities and operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air, soil and water, and establish standards for the handling of hazardous and toxic substances and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Some of the environmental laws applicable to us provide that a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of environmental contamination on, under, or in that property or other impacted properties. Accordingly, such liability could apply to us in connection with any of our current or former manufacturing plants or other properties. In addition, some of these laws provide that persons who arrange, or are deemed to have arranged, for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of environmental contamination at the disposal or treatment site, regardless of whether the affected site is owned or operated by such person. Environmental laws, in general, ----- often impose liability whether or not the owner, operator or arranger knew of, or caused, the presence of such environmental contamination. Also, third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries, for property damage and/or for clean-up associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances pursuant to applicable environmental laws and common law tort theories, including strict liability. Failure to comply with environmental laws or regulations could result in severe fines and penalties. We are also subject to permitting requirements under environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Those requirements obligate us to obtain permits from one or more governmental agencies in order to conduct our operations. Such permits are typically issued by state agencies, but permits and approvals may also be required from federal or local governmental agencies. The requirements for such permits vary depending on the location where our regulated activities are conducted. As with all governmental permitting processes, there is a degree of uncertainty as to whether a permit will be granted, the time it will take for a permit to be issued and the conditions that may be imposed in connection with the granting of the permit. We are not aware of any environmental liabilities that would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We believe we comply in all material respects with environmental laws and regulations and possess the permits required to operate our manufacturing and other facilities.

No later than 30 days following any Change of Control, except to the extent the Issuer has exercised its right to redeem the Notes by delivery of a notice of redemption as described under “—Optional Redemption,” the Issuer will send notice of such Change of Control Offer electronically or by first-class mail, with a copy to the Trustee sent in the same manner, to each Holder to the address of such Holder appearing in the security register or otherwise in accordance with the procedures of DTC, with the following information: ----- (1) that a Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to the covenant entitled “Change of Control,” and that all Notes properly tendered pursuant to such Change of Control Offer will be accepted for payment by the Issuer; (2) the purchase price and the purchase date, which will be no earlier than 15 days nor later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), except in the case of a conditional Change of Control Offer made in advance of a Change of Control as described below; (3) that any Note not properly tendered will remain outstanding and continue to accrue interest; (4) that, unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the Change of Control Payment, all Notes accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer will cease to accrue interest on the Change of Control Payment Date; (5) that Holders electing to have any Notes purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender such Notes, with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of such Notes completed, to the paying agent specified in the notice at the address specified in the notice prior to the close of business on the third Business Day preceding the Change of Control Payment Date; (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their tendered Notes and their election to require the Issuer to purchase such Notes; provided that the paying agent receives, not later than the expiration time of the Change of Control Offer, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of Notes tendered for purchase, and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing its tendered Notes and its election to have such Notes purchased; (7) if such notice is delivered prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control and, if applicable, stating that, in the Issuer’s discretion, the Change of Control Payment Date may be delayed until such time (including more than 60 days after the notice is mailed or delivered, including by electronic transmission) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or that such purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that the Issuer shall determine that any or all of the applicable conditions shall not have been satisfied by the Change of Control Payment Date, or by the Change of Control Payment Date as so delayed; and (8) the other instructions, as determined by the Issuer, consistent with the covenant hereunder, that a Holder must follow.

In the event that the Issuer makes a Change of Control Payment, the paying agent will promptly mail to each Holder the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will promptly authenticate a new Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Note will be in a minimum principal amount of $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. While the Notes are in global form and if the Issuer makes an offer to purchase all of the Notes pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, a Holder may exercise its option to elect for the purchase of the Notes through the facilities of DTC, subject to its rules and regulations. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws or regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will be deemed to have complied with its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. ----- The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer if a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all such Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditional upon such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time of the making of such Change of Control Offer. If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such Holders, the Issuer or such Person will have the right, upon not less than 15 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice, given not more than 30 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer described above, to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a redemption price in cash equal to the applicable Change of Control Payment plus, to the extent not included in the Change of Control Payment, accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. The Senior Secured Credit Facilities provide that certain change of control events with respect to the Issuer would constitute a default or event of default thereunder (including a Change of Control under the Indenture). The terms of future debt agreements may contain prohibitions on certain events that could constitute a Change of Control or require such indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes upon a Change of Control could cause a default under our other indebtedness due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. If we experience a change of control event that triggers a default under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities or future debt agreements, we could seek a waiver of such default or event of default or seek to refinance our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. In the event we do not obtain such a waiver or refinance the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or future debt agreements, such default could result in amounts outstanding under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities or future debt agreements being declared due and payable, which may in turn constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. Our ability to pay cash to the Holders following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by our then-existing financial resources. Therefore, sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required repurchases of the Notes. See “Risk factors—Risks relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We may not be able to repurchase the notes upon a change of control.” The Change of Control purchase feature of the Notes may in certain circumstances make more difficult or discourage a sale or takeover of the Issuer (or any Parent Entity) and, thus, the removal of incumbent management. The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the Initial Purchasers. Subject to the limitations discussed below, we could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or other recapitalizations, that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness outstanding at such time or otherwise affect our capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on our ability to incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock” and “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens.” Such restrictions in the Indenture can be waived only with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction. The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as described above. See “Risk factors—Risks Relating to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Holders of the notes may not be able to determine when a change of control giving rise to their right to have the notes repurchased has occurred following a sale of “substantially all” of our assets.” The provisions under the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Notes as a result of a Change of Control, including the definition of “Change of Control,” may be waived, amended or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes outstanding under the Indenture.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Within 365 days after the receipt of any Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may apply such Net Cash Proceeds at its option: (i) to permanently repay or reduce (a) Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien, which Lien is permitted by the Indenture, (b) Indebtedness of a Non-Guarantor Restricted Subsidiary (other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary); or (c) Obligations under the Notes; provided, in each case, if the Indebtedness repaid is revolving credit Indebtedness, and, in each case, to correspondingly reduce commitments with respect thereto; (ii) to permanently repay or reduce other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Notes (“Pari Passu Indebtedness”); other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary, provided that if the Issuer or any Guarantor shall so reduce any such Pari Passu Indebtedness under unsecured Pari Passu Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (ii) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include Indebtedness described in clause (i) even if such Indebtedness may also constitute Pari Passu Indebtedness), the Issuer shall equally and ratably reduce (or offer to reduce) Obligations under the Notes as provided either, at the Issuer’s option, under “—Optional Redemption,” through open-market purchases or in arm’s-length privately negotiated transactions or by making an offer (in accordance with the procedures set forth below for an Asset Sale Offer) to all Holders to purchase a pro rata principal amount of Notes at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or, in the event that the Notes were issued with significant original issue discount, 100% of the accreted value thereof), plus the amount of accrued but unpaid interest, if any, on the amount of Notes that would otherwise be prepaid; ----- (iii) to make an investment in any one or more businesses (provided that if such investment is in the form of the acquisition of Capital Stock of a Person, such acquisition results in such Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or in an increase in the percentage ownership by the Issuer (or a Restricted Subsidiary) in such Restricted Subsidiary), assets, or property or capital expenditures, in each case (a) used or useful in a Permitted Business or (b) that replace the properties and assets that are the subject of such Asset Sale or, in each case, to reimburse the cost of any of the foregoing incurred on or after the date on which the Asset Sale giving rise to such Net Proceeds was contractually committed; or (iv) any combination of the foregoing; _provided that, in the case of clause (iii) above, a binding commitment to make such acquisitions or expenditures entered into_ within 365 days of the consummation of the Asset Sale that generated the Net Cash Proceeds shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment so long as the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into such commitment with the good faith expectation that such Net Proceeds will be applied to satisfy such commitment within 450 days after the consummation of the Asset Sale that generated such Net Cash Proceeds days and, in the event such commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before the Net Proceeds are applied in connection therewith, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds unless the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary enters into another binding commitment within 180 days of such cancellation or termination (a “Second Commitment”) and such Net Proceeds are actually applied in such manner within 180 days from the date of the Second Commitment; provided, further, that if any Second Commitment is later cancelled or terminated for any reason before such Net Proceeds are applied, then such Net Proceeds shall constitute Excess Proceeds to the extent the Asset Sale Proceeds application period has expired. Any Net Cash Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph of this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds.” When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds $50.0 million, the Issuer will, within 20 Business Days, make an offer to all Holders, and, if required or permitted by the terms of other Pari Passu Indebtedness, to all holders of such other Pari Passu Indebtedness (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to purchase the maximum aggregate principal amount (or accreted value, as applicable) of the Notes and/or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, with respect to the Notes only, that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof, that may be purchased out of the Excess Proceeds at an offer price, with respect to the Notes only, in cash in an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof (or 100% of the accreted value thereof, if less), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date fixed for the closing of such offer, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture and, if applicable, the other documents governing the applicable Pari Passu Indebtedness. The Issuer may satisfy the foregoing obligation with respect to such Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale by making an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the application period (the “Advance Offer”) for the proceeds of an Asset Sale with respect to all or a part of the available Net Proceeds (the “Advance Portion”) in advance of being required to do so by the Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Notes and other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered into such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion), the Excess Proceeds (or, in the case of an Advance Offer, the Advance Portion) will be allocated between the Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness based on the principal amount (or accreted value, if applicable) of the Notes and such other Pari Passu Indebtedness tendered and the Trustee shall select the Notes (subject to applicable DTC procedures as to global notes) and the Issuer or the representative of such Pari Passu Indebtedness shall select such Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased or repaid on a pro rata basis based on the accreted value or principal amount of the Notes or such Pari Passu Indebtedness, tendered with adjustments as necessary so that no Notes or Pari Passu Indebtedness, as the case may be, will be repurchased in part in an unauthorized denomination. Upon completion of any such Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero (regardless of whether there are any remaining Excess Proceeds upon such completion), and in the case of an Advance Offer, the amount of Net Proceeds the Issuer is offering to apply in such Advance Offer shall be excluded in subsequent calculations of Excess Proceeds. Additionally, upon consummation or expiration of any Advance Offer, any remaining Net Proceeds shall not be deemed Excess Proceeds and the Issuer may use such Net Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited under the Indenture. Pending the final application of any Net Cash Proceeds pursuant to this covenant, the holder of such Net Cash Proceeds may apply such Net Cash Proceeds temporarily to reduce Obligations under a revolving credit facility or otherwise use such Net Cash Proceeds in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of the Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer may use those funds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture and they will no longer constitute Excess Proceeds. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with each repurchase of Notes pursuant to an offer to purchase. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will be deemed to have complied with its obligations under the Asset Sale provisions of the Indenture by virtue of such compliance. ----- The Senior Secured Credit Facilities and future credit agreements or other agreements relating to Indebtedness to which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer becomes a party may prohibit or limit the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer from purchasing any Notes pursuant to this Asset Sales covenant. In addition, future debt agreements of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer may place significant limitations on the ability of Restricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer to pay dividends or make distributions to the Issuer for the purpose of purchasing Notes with the proceeds of Asset Sales. In the event the Issuer is prohibited from purchasing the Notes, or the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are prohibited from distributing funds to the Issuer for the purpose of making an Asset Sale Offer, the Issuer or its Subsidiaries could seek the consent of their respective lenders for the purchase of the Notes or the distribution to the Issuer of funds for such purpose. If the Issuer or its Subsidiaries do not obtain such consents or repay the applicable borrowings, the Issuer may be unable to purchase the Notes in accordance with this covenant. In such case, the Issuer’s failure to purchase tendered Notes would constitute an Event of Default under the Indenture. If more Notes are tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale offer than the Issuer is required to purchase, selection of such Notes for purchase will be made in compliance with the requirements of the principal national securities exchange, if any, on which such Notes are listed (so long as the Trustee knows of such listing) or if such Notes are not listed, on a pro rata basis, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee shall deem fair and appropriate (and in such manner as complies with applicable legal requirements and applicable procedures of DTC); provided that the selection of notes for purchase shall not result in a Holder with a principal amount of Notes less than the minimum denomination to the extent practicable.

If on any date following the Issue Date (i) the Notes have Investment Grade Ratings from both Rating Agencies and (ii) no Default has occurred and is continuing under the Indenture then, beginning on such date (the occurrence of the events described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) being collectively referred to as a “Covenant Suspension Event”), the covenants specifically listed under the following captions in this “Description of Notes” section of this offering memorandum will not be applicable to the Notes (collectively, the “Suspended Covenants”): - “—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Asset Sales,” - “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock,” - “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments,” - “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries,” - “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Transactions With Affiliates,” - Clause (iii) of the first paragraph of “—Certain Covenants—Consolidation, Merger, Conveyance, Transfer or Lease; IPO,” and - “—Additional Note Guarantees.” If and while the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants, the Notes will be entitled to substantially less covenant protection. In the event that the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries are not subject to the Suspended Covenants for any period of time as a result of the foregoing and on any subsequent date (the “Reinstatement Date”) one or both of the Rating Agencies withdraws its Investment Grade Rating or downgrades the rating assigned to the Notes below an Investment Grade Rating, then the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries will thereafter be subject to the Suspended Covenants under the Indenture with respect to future events unless and until a subsequent Covenant Suspension Event occurs. Notwithstanding that the Suspended Covenants may be reinstated, no Default, Event of Default or breach of any kind shall be deemed to exist under the Indenture or the Notes with respect to the Suspended Covenants based on, and none of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries shall bear any liability for, any actions taken or events occurring during the Suspension Period (as defined below), or any actions taken at any time pursuant to any contractual obligation arising during any Suspension Period, regardless of whether such actions or events would have been permitted if the applicable Suspended Covenants remained in effect during such period (or after the Suspension Period for actions ----- taken to honor, comply with or otherwise perform any contractual obligations or other obligations arising prior to the Reinstatement Date and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby). The period of time between the occurrence of the Covenant Suspension Event and the Reinstatement Date is referred to as the “Suspension Period.” The Issuer will provide the Trustee with written notice of each Covenant Suspension Event or Reinstatement Date within five Business Days of the Issuer’s knowledge of the occurrence thereof. The Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor or provide notice to the Holders of any such Covenant Suspension Event or Reinstatement Date. The Trustee shall have no obligation to (i) independently determine or verify if any Covenant Suspension Event or Reinstatement Date shall have occurred, (ii) make any determination regarding the impact of any actions taken by the Issuer during a Suspension Period or the Issuer’s future compliance with any covenants or (iii) monitor or provide notice to the Holders of any such Covenant Suspension Event, Suspension Period or Reinstatement Date On the Reinstatement Date, (i) all Indebtedness Incurred, or Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock issued, during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been Incurred or issued pursuant to clause (c) of the second paragraph of “—Limitation on Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Disqualified Stock,”, (ii) all Liens Incurred during the Suspension Period will be classified to have been Incurred under clause (a) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” (iii) any Affiliate Transaction entered into on or after the Reinstatement Date pursuant to an agreement entered into during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (5) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under “—Transactions with affiliates,” and (iv) any encumbrance or restriction on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor to take any action described in clauses (i) through (iii) of the first paragraph of the covenant described under “—Limitation on dividend and other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries” that becomes effective during any Suspension Period shall be deemed to be permitted pursuant to clause (a) of the covenant described under “—Limitation on dividend and other payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries.” Calculations made after the Reinstatement Date of the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” will be made as though the covenants described under “—Limitation on Restricted Payments” had been in effect since the Issue Date and prior to, but not during, the Suspension Period. Accordingly, Restricted Payments made during the Suspension Period will not reduce the amount available to be made as Restricted Payments under the first paragraph of “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”. During any period when the Suspended Covenants are suspended, the Issuer may not designate any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the Indenture. Within 30 days of such Reinstatement Date, the Issuer must comply with the terms of the covenant described under ‘‘—Additional Note Guarantees.’’ For purposes of the ‘‘—Asset Sales’’ covenant, on the Reinstatement Date, the unutilized Excess Proceeds amount will be reset to zero.

Accrual of interest, the accretion of accreted value, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest or dividends in the form of additional Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock, the accretion of liquidation preference and increases in the amount of Indebtedness outstanding solely as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness, Disqualified Stock or Preferred Stock for purposes of this covenant. If Indebtedness originally incurred in reliance upon a percentage of EBITDA of the Issuer is being refinanced and such refinancing would cause the maximum amount of Indebtedness thereunder to be exceeded at such time, then such refinancing will nevertheless be permitted thereunder and such additional Indebtedness will be deemed to have been incurred under the applicable clause so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of Indebtedness being refinanced plus the Additional Refinancing Amount. For purposes of determining compliance with any U.S. dollar-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness or issuance of Disqualified Stock, the U.S. dollar-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of revolving credit indebtedness; provided that if such Indebtedness is Incurred to Refinance other Indebtedness denominated in another currency, and such Refinancing would cause the applicable U.S. dollar-denominated restriction to be exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such Refinancing, such U.S. dollar-denominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed (i) the principal amount of such Indebtedness being Refinanced plus (ii) the aggregate amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses Incurred in connection with such Refinancing. The Indenture will not treat (1) unsecured Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to Secured Indebtedness merely because it is unsecured or (2) senior Indebtedness as subordinated or junior to any other senior Indebtedness merely because it has a junior priority with respect to the same collateral or because it is guaranteed by other obligors.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes solely because an Event of Default described in clause (6) above has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically rescinded and annulled if the Event of Default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (6) shall be remedied or cured by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or waived by the holders of the relevant Indebtedness within 30 Business Days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if the rescission and annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Trustee for the payment of amounts due on the Notes. Any notice of Event of Default, notice of acceleration or instruction to the Trustee to provide a notice of Event of Default, notice of acceleration or to take any other action (a “Noteholder Direction”) provided by any one or more Holders (each a “Directing _Holder”) must be accompanied by a written representation from each such Holder to the Issuer and the Trustee that such Holder is not_ Net Short (a “Position Representation”), which representation, in the case of a Noteholder Direction relating to a notice of Event of Default shall be deemed repeated at all times until the resulting Event of Default is cured or otherwise ceases to exist or the Notes are accelerated.

In any case in which the Holder is DTC or its nominee, any Position Representation or Verification Covenant required hereunder shall be provided by the beneficial owner of the Notes in lieu of DTC or its nominee. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any Noteholder Direction delivered to it in accordance with this Indenture, shall have no duty to inquire as to or investigate the accuracy of any Position Representation, enforce compliance with any Verification Covenant, verify any statements in any Noteholder Direction, or otherwise make calculations, investigations or determinations with respect to Derivative Instruments, Net Shorts, Long Derivative Instruments, Short Derivative Instruments or otherwise and shall have no liability for ceasing to take any action, staying any remedy or otherwise failing to act in accordance with a Noteholder Direction during the pendency of any dispute related to a Noteholder Direction or Verification ----- Covenant. The Trustee shall have no liability to the Issuer, any Holder or any other Person in acting in good faith on a Noteholder Direction. If an Event of Default specified in clause (8) above occurs, the principal of, premium, if any, and any accrued interest on the Notes then outstanding shall ipso facto become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder. For further information as to waiver of defaults, see “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver.” The Trustee may withhold from Holders notice of any Default (except Default in payment of principal of, premium, if any, and interest) if the Trustee determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders to do so. No Holder of any Note will have any right to institute any proceeding with respect to the Indenture or for any remedy thereunder, unless (x) such Holder shall have previously given to the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default, (y) the Holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes voting as a single class shall have made written request to the Trustee, and provided indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its reasonable discretion, to institute such proceeding as Trustee and (z) the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes a direction inconsistent with such request and shall have failed to institute such proceeding within 60 days. Such limitations do not apply, however, to a suit instituted by a Holder directly (as opposed to through the Trustee) for enforcement of payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on such Note on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Note. The Issuer will be required to furnish to the Trustee annually a statement as to compliance with its obligations under the Indenture.

1069,Offerings 2020.md,1053,BOOK ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM,1053.1,The Global Notes,1053.1.1,,"We expect that, pursuant to procedures established by DTC, (i) upon the issuance of the Global Notes, DTC or its custodian will credit, on its internal system, the principal amount at maturity of the individual beneficial interests represented by such Global Notes to the respective accounts of persons who have accounts with such depositary (“participants”) and (ii) ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership will be effected only through, records maintained by DTC or its nominee (with respect to interests of participants) and the records of participants (with respect to interests of persons other than participants). Such accounts initially will be designated by or on behalf of the initial purchasers and ownership of beneficial interests in the Global Notes will be limited to participants or persons who hold interests through participants. Holders may hold their interests in the Global Notes directly through DTC if they are participants in such system, or indirectly through organizations that are participants in such system. So long as DTC or its nominee is the registered owner or holder of the notes, DTC or such nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole owner or holder of the notes represented by such Global Notes for all purposes under the indenture. No beneficial owner of an interest in the Global Notes will be able to transfer that interest except in accordance with the procedures of DTC and its direct or indirect participants (including, if applicable, those of Euroclear and Clearstream), in addition to those provided for under the indenture with respect to the notes. ----- Payments of the principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on, the Global Notes will be made to DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, as the registered owner thereof. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to or payments made on account of beneficial ownership interests in the Global Notes or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing any records relating to such beneficial ownership interest. We expect that DTC or its nominee, upon receipt of any payment of principal of, and premium (if any) and interest on the Global Notes, will credit participants’ accounts with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective beneficial interests in the principal amount of the Global Notes as shown on the records of DTC or its nominee. We also expect that payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in the Global Notes held through such participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practice, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers registered in the names of nominees for such customers. Such payments will be the responsibility of such participants. Transfers between participants in DTC will be effected in the ordinary way through DTC’s same-day funds system in accordance with DTC rules and will be settled in same-day funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of a Certificated Security, such holder must transfer its interest in a Global Note, in accordance with the normal procedures of DTC and with the procedures set forth in the indenture, and transfers between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be effected in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. DTC has advised us that it will take any action permitted to be taken by a holder of notes (including the presentation of notes for exchange as described below) only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the DTC interests in the Global Notes are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of notes as to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. However, if there is an event of default under the indenture, DTC reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for Certificated Securities, which it will distribute to its participants and which will be legended as set forth under the heading “Transfer Restrictions.” DTC has advised us as follows: DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under New York banking law, a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York banking law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds and provides asset servicing for issues of U.S. and non-U.S. equity, corporate and municipal debt issues that participants deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts. This eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Participants include both U.S. and nonU.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Access to the DTC system is also available to indirect participants such as both U.S. and non-U.S. securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant, either directly or indirectly. Although DTC has agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants of DTC, it is under no obligation to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any time. We provide the foregoing summaries of those procedures solely for the convenience of investors. None of us, the Trustee or any paying agent will have any responsibility for the performance by DTC or its participants or indirect participants of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

Transfers involving exchanges of beneficial interests between the Regulation S Global Notes and the Restricted Global Notes will be effected by DTC by means of an instruction originated by the Trustee through the DTC deposit/withdrawal at custodian system. Accordingly, in connection with any such transfer, appropriate adjustments will be made to reflect a decrease in the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note and a corresponding increase in the principal amount of the Restricted Global Note or vice versa, as applicable. Any beneficial interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of an interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be an interest in such Global Note and will become an interest in the other Global Note and, accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all transfer restrictions and other procedures applicable to beneficial interests in such other Global Note for so long as it remains such an interest.

If you are not a United States holder, this subsection does not apply to you and you should refer to “Non-United States Holders” below. Contingent Payments. In certain circumstances, we may be obligated to pay amounts in excess of stated interest or principal on the notes. The obligation to make these payments may implicate the provisions of the U.S. Treasury regulations relating to “contingent payment debt instruments.” We believe that as of the issue date the likelihood that we will be obligated to make any such payments as a result of the contingencies described in “Description of the Notes—Repurchase at the Option of Holders—Change of control” is remote. Therefore, we do not intend to treat the potential payment of these amounts as subjecting the notes to the contingent payment debt instrument rules. Our determination is binding on a United States holder unless such United States holder discloses its contrary position in a statement attached to its timely filed United States federal income tax return for the taxable year during which a note was acquired. Our determination is not, however, binding on the IRS, and if the IRS were to challenge this determination, the tax consequences to a United States holder could differ from those discussed herein. The remainder of this disclosure assumes that the notes will not be treated as contingent payment debt instruments for United States federal income tax purposes. Payments of Interest. You will be taxed on interest on your note as ordinary income at the time you receive the interest or when it accrues, depending on your method of accounting for tax purposes. Purchase, Sale and Retirement of the Notes. Your tax basis in your note generally will be the amount you paid for the note. You will generally recognize capital gain or loss on the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition of your note equal to the difference between the amount you realize on the sale, retirement or other taxable disposition, excluding any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest (which will be treated as interest payments to the extent not previously included in income), and your tax basis in your note. Capital gain of a noncorporate United States holder is generally taxed at preferential rates where the property is held for more than one year. Otherwise, such gain will be short-term capital gain.

To claim the exemption, you must furnish to the applicable withholding agent a valid IRS Form W-8ECI, certifying that interest paid on a note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with the conduct by you of a trade or business within the United States.

Under ERISA and the Code, any person who exercises any discretionary authority or control over the administration of such an ERISA Plan or the management or disposition of the assets of such an ERISA Plan, or who renders investment advice for a fee or other compensation to such an ERISA Plan or has authority or responsibility to do so, is generally considered to be a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan. Any Plan fiduciary that proposes to cause a Plan to purchase the notes should consult with its counsel regarding the potential applicability of the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA and the prohibited transaction provisions of Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code to such an investment, and to confirm that such acquisition and holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction or any other violation of an applicable requirement of ERISA or whether an exemption would be applicable to any such purchase of notes. In considering an investment in the notes of a portion of the assets of any Plan, a fiduciary should determine whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the Plan and the applicable provisions of ERISA, the Code or any Similar Law relating to a fiduciary’s duties to the Plan including, without limitation, the prudence, diversification, delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA, the Code and any other applicable Similar Laws.

The Transaction Parties are not undertaking to provide impartial investment advice or advice based on any particular investment need, or to give advice in a fiduciary capacity, with respect to the decision to purchase or hold the notes. All communications, correspondence and materials from the Transaction Parties with respect to the notes are intended to be general in nature and are not directed at any specific purchaser of the notes, and do not constitute advice regarding the advisability of investment in the notes for any specific purchaser.

Those sections further prohibit a fiduciary from engaging in transactions in which a conflict of interest is deemed present. The fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that proposes to purchase and hold any notes should consider, among other things, whether such purchase and holding may involve (i) the direct or indirect extension of credit between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, (ii) the sale or exchange of any property between an ERISA Plan and a party in interest or a disqualified person, or (iii) the transfer to, or use by or for the benefit of, a party in interest or disqualified person, of any ERISA Plan assets. Such parties in interest or disqualified persons could include, without limitation, the Issuer, the initial purchasers or any of their respective affiliates. A party in interest or disqualified person who engages in a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. In addition, a fiduciary of the ERISA Plan that engages in such a non-exempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under ERISA and the Code. The acquisition and/or holding of the notes by an ERISA Plan with respect to which the Issuer, an initial purchaser or a guarantor is considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA and/or Section 4975 of the Code, unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory, class or individual prohibited transaction exemption. In this regard, the U.S. Department of Labor has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions, or PTCEs, that may provide exemptive relief for direct or indirect prohibited transactions resulting from the acquisition and/or holding of the notes. These class exemptions include, without limitation, PTCE 84-14 respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers, PTCE 90-1 respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts, PTCE 91-38 respecting bank collective investment funds, PTCE 95-60 respecting life insurance company general accounts and PTCE 96-23 respecting transactions determined by ----- in-house asset managers, although there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. In addition to the foregoing, Section 408(b)(17) of ERISA and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide a statutory exemption for certain transactions between an ERISA Plan and a person that is a party in interest and/or a disqualified person (other than a fiduciary or an affiliate that (directly or indirectly) has or exercises any discretionary authority or control or renders any investment advice with respect to the assets of any ERISA Plan) solely by reason of providing services to the ERISA Plan or by relationship to a service provider, provided that the ERISA Plan pays no more and receives no less than adequate consideration in connection with the transaction. These exemptions do not, however, provide relief from the self-dealing prohibitions under ERISA and the Code. It should also be noted that even if the conditions specified in one or more of these exemptions are met, the scope of relief provided by these exemptions may not necessarily cover all acts that might be construed as prohibited transactions. Therefore, the fiduciary of an ERISA Plan that is considering acquiring and/or holding the notes in reliance on any of these, or any other, exemption should carefully review the exemption and consult with its counsel to confirm that it is applicable. There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied. Governmental plans, non-U.S. plans and certain church plans, while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility provisions of ERISA or the prohibited transaction provisions of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code, may nevertheless be subject to Similar Laws which may affect their investment in the notes. Any fiduciary of a governmental, non-U.S. or such a church plan considering an investment in the notes should consult with its counsel before purchasing notes to consider the applicable fiduciary standards and to determine the need for, and, if necessary, the availability of, any exemptive relief under any applicable Similar Laws. Because of the foregoing, the notes should not be purchased or held by any person investing “plan assets” of any Plan, unless such purchase or holding will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Code or similar violation of any applicable Similar Laws. The foregoing discussion is general in nature and is not intended to be all-inclusive nor should it be construed as legal advice. Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions, it is particularly important that fiduciaries, or other persons considering purchasing the notes (and holding the notes) on behalf of, or with the assets of, any Plan, consult with their counsel regarding the potential applicability of ERISA, Section 4975 of the Code and any Similar Laws to such investment and whether an exemption would be applicable to the purchase and holding of the notes. Purchasers of the notes have the exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of the notes complies with the fiduciary responsibility rules of ERISA and does not violate the prohibited transaction rules of ERISA, the Code or applicable Similar Laws.

During the extended transition period, the Company is not subject to new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. The accounting pronouncements pending adoption below reflect effective dates for the Company as an EGC with the extended transition period. On October 1, 2018, the Company early adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, which outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. The update supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. Under the new standard, entities are required to identify the contract with a customer; identify the separate performance obligations in the contract; determine the transaction price; allocate the transaction price to the separate performance obligations in the contract; and recognize the appropriate amount of revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies each performance obligation. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 2 for additional information. On October 1, 2019, the Company adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfer of Assets Other Than Inventory. The standard amends several aspects of the tax accounting and recognition timing for intra-company transfers. The Company adopted the standard using a modified retrospective approach, with an adjustment to the beginning retained earnings of approximately $1.3 million, due to the cumulative impact of adopting the standard. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 12 for additional information.",,as_expected,2020,252,,
1069,Offerings 2020.md,2277,LIABILITIES AND MEMBER’S:,2277.13,b.** **Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,2277.13.6,Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements,"In February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842), and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in January 2018 within ASU No. 2018-01, in July 2018 within ASU Nos. 201810 and 2018-11, in December 2018 within ASU No. 2018-20, in March 2019 within ASU No. 2019-01 and in November 2019 within ASU No. 2019-10. This standard requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. For public entities, the updated standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018. This standard is effective for the Company as an EGC for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. Assuming the Company remains an EGC, it intends to adopt the updated standard during its fiscal year beginning October 1, 2021 and for interim periods within that fiscal year. This standard provides the option to adopt through a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption, instead of applying the new guidance retrospectively for each prior reporting period presented. The Company is currently evaluating the impact these ASU’s adoption will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), and issued subsequent amendments to the initial guidance in May 2019 within ASU No. 2019-05 and in November 2019 within ASU Nos. 2019-10 and 2019-11. This standard sets forth an expected credit loss model, which requires the measurement of expected credit losses for financial instruments based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. For public entities, the updated standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years. This standard is effective for the Company as an EGC for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, and the standard is adopted using a modified retrospective transition method through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective. The Company is currently evaluating the impact adoption of this standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which amends Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. This standard modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. For all entities, this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company intends to adopt the updated standard during its fiscal year beginning October 1, 2020 and for interim periods within fiscal years beginning in that fiscal ----- year. The removed and modified disclosures will be adopted on a retrospective basis and the new disclosures will be adopted on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact adoption of this standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. This standard aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. For public entities, the updated standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company, as an EGC, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. This standard can be adopted either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. Assuming the Company remains an EGC, it intends to adopt the updated standard during its fiscal year beginning October 1, 2021 and for interim periods within fiscal year beginning October 1, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact adoption of this standard will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740)—Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to general principles in Topic 740 and clarifying and amending existing guidance. For public entities, the amendments in this ASU are effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. For all other entities, the amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. Early adoption of the amendments is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for (1) public business entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been issued and (2) all other entities for periods for which financial statements have not yet been made available for issuance. An entity that elects to early adopt the amendments in an interim period should reflect any adjustments as of the beginning of the annual period that includes that interim period. Additionally, an entity that elects early adoption must adopt all the amendments in the same period. The amendments are applied on a prospective or retrospective basis, depending upon the amendment adopted within this ASU. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company, as an EGC, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact adoption of these amendments will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

The Company’s Residential Segment principally generates revenue from the manufacture and sale of its premium, low maintenance composite decking, railing, trim, moulding, pavers products and accessories. The Company’s Commercial Segment generates revenue from the sale of its partition and locker systems along with plastic sheeting and other non-fabricated products for special applications in industrial markets. The Company recognizes revenues when control of the promised goods is transferred to the Company’s customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods, at a point in time, when shipping occurs. Each product the Company transfers to the customer is considered one performance obligation. The Company has elected to account for shipping and handling costs as activities to fulfill the promise to transfer the goods. As a result of this accounting policy election, the Company does not consider shipping and handling activities as promised services to its customers. Customer contracts are typically fixed price and short-term in nature. The transaction price is based on the product specifications and is determined at the time of order. The Company may offer various sales incentive programs throughout the year. It estimates the amount of sales incentive to allocate to each performance obligation, or product shipped, using the most-likely-amount method of estimation, based on sales to the direct customer or sell-through customer. The estimate is updated each reporting period and any changes are allocated to the performance obligations on the same basis as at inception. Changes in estimate allocated to a previously satisfied performance obligation are recognized as part of net revenue in the period in which the change occurs under the cumulative catch-up method. In addition to sales incentive programs, the Company may offer a payment discount, if payments are received within 30 days. The Company estimates the payment discount that it believes will be taken by the customer based on prior history and using the most-likely-amount method of estimation. The Company believes the most-likely-amount method best predicts the amount of consideration to which it will be entitled. The payment discounts are also reflected as part of net revenue.

The proceeds from borrowings under the amended Term Loan Agreement and the Senior Notes were used to (i) fund the acquisition of CPG International LLC and (ii) repay all amounts outstanding under the Company’s prior term loan agreement, prior notes and related fees. During the year ended September 30, 2017, CPG International LLC amended and extended the maturity of the Term Loan Agreement. Financing fees of $3.3 million were incurred for the transaction, $1.5 million of which were capitalized and $1.8 million of which were recognized in interest expense. On June 18, 2018, in conjunction with the acquisition of Versatex, the Term Loan Agreement was amended to increase the borrowing outstanding by $225.0 million. This amendment was accounted for as a modification. Financing fees of $6.7 million were incurred for the transaction, $5.7 million were capitalized and $1.0 million were recognized in “Interest expense”. Included in the $5.7 million of financing fees capitalized was an original issue discount of $0.6 million. The Term Loan Agreement matures on the earlier of (i) May 5, 2024 and (ii) 181 days prior to the maturity of the Senior Notes.

As of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019, unamortized deferred financing fees related to the Term Loan Agreement consisted of $8.6 million and $9.1 million, respectively. The Term Loan Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid in whole, or in part, in each case without premium or penalty (other than the Prepayment Premium (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), if applicable), subject to certain customary conditions.

The obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and the wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of CPG International LLC other than certain immaterial subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries. The Term Loan Agreement requires mandatory prepayments of the term loans thereunder from certain debt issuances, certain asset dispositions (subject to certain reinvestment rights) and a percentage of excess cash flow (subject to step-downs upon CPG ----- International LLC achieving certain leverage ratios). The estimated prepayment of excess cash flow was $6.4 million at September 30, 2019. The lenders do have the option to decline any prepayment based on excess cash flows. CPG International LLC is required to repay the outstanding principal amount under the Term Loan Agreement in quarterly installments equal to 0.25253% of the aggregate principal amount under the Term Loan Agreement outstanding on the amendment date of June 18, 2018 and such quarterly payments may be reduced as a result of prepayments.

If the average daily used percentage is greater than 50%, the commitment fee equals 25 basis points, and if the average daily used percentage is less than or equal to 50%, the commitment fee equals 37.5 basis points. The commitment fees expenses were $0.1 million and $0.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

CPG International LLC is also required to make mandatory prepayments (i) when aggregate borrowings exceed commitments or the applicable borrowing base and (ii) during “cash dominion,” which occurs if (a) the availability under the Revolving Credit Agreement is less than the greater of (i) $12.5 million and (ii) 10% of the lesser of (x) $150.0 million and (y) the borrowing base, for five consecutive business days or (b) certain events of default have occurred and are continuing. The Revolving Credit Facility contains affirmative covenants that are customary for financings of this type, including allowing the Revolver Administrative Agent to perform periodic field exams and appraisals to evaluate the borrowing base. The Revolving Credit Facility contains various negative covenants, including limitations on, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of indebtedness, the incurrence of liens, dispositions, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, as well as other negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a financial maintenance covenant, applicable only when the excess availability is less than the greater of (i) 10% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the borrowing base, and (ii) $12.5 million. In such circumstances, CPG International LLC would be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) for the trailing four quarters equal to at least 1.0 to 1.0; subject to CPG International LLC’s ability to make an equity cure (no more than twice in any four quarter period and up to five times over the life of the facility).

The Company records accretion expense in Cost of sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) in order to increase the value of the liability to reflect the future value of the warranty claims when they are actually settled. In addition, the Company records estimated warranty claims obligations related to current sales on an ongoing basis for the TimberTech product line.

The contingent payment was based on achievement of a minimum EBITDA amount and a multiple of EBITDA, for EBITDA exceeding a higher threshold for calendar year 2018. Based on the formula, the potential minimum of the contingent payment was zero and the potential maximum was $30.0 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, the Company paid the former owners of Ultralox $2.0 million as partial settlement of the original contingent liability. At the acquisition date, the fair value was estimated to be $5.3 million. Of the fair value, $2.8 million is accounted for as contingent consideration in conjunction with the acquisition related to the non-employee owners, and the remaining $2.5 million (which was subsequently adjusted downward to $0.9 million due to changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent payment) was recognized as compensation expense from date of acquisition through June 30, 2018 related to the employee owners, who forfeit their share of the contingent payment if not employed through that date. The contingent payment made was based on achievement of a minimum EBITDA amount and a multiple of EBITDA, for EBITDA exceeding a higher threshold for calendar 2018. The Company classified the contingent liability as Level 3, due to the lack of observable inputs. Significant assumptions made by the Company included a central estimate of EBITDA and EBITDA volatility of 39%. Changes in assumptions could have an impact on the payout of the contingent consideration payout amount.

The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-16, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory, on October 1, 2019. The updated guidance requires companies to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. Income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of inventory will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a third party. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

In connection with a contingent liability assumed by the Company in the acquisition, the Company recorded a contingent liability of $5.8 million as a measurement period adjustment to the opening balance sheet related to the assumption of a contingency related to an automobile accident involving a Versatex employee prior to the acquisition. During 2019, the case was in discovery and has progressed to settlement discussions. As such, the Company recorded a $5.8 million accrual and a $5.8 million contingent insurance recovery as the insurance carrier verified the loss was covered under the related automobile insurance policy. Both the reserve and the recovery receivable were recorded in the opening balance sheet, as the liability and recovery was known at the date of the acquisition. There was no impact to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) during the year ended September 30, 2018. The contingent liability is classified as Accrued expenses and other liabilities, and the contingent receivable is classified as Other current assets in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019. During the year ended September 30, 2019, the Company was made aware of a workers compensation case that became reasonably possible to incur a liability. The case is in discovery as the nature and extent of the Company’s exposure is currently being determined. The Company expects a range of loss of $0.4 million to $0.5 million. As of December 31, 2019, there are various other worker’s compensation and personal injury claims that have been made against the Company. All such claims are being contested and the Company does not believe a loss is probable; therefore, no reserve has been recorded related to these matters. In addition, the Company carries insurance for these types of matters and is expecting to recover thereon. The Company is a party to various legal proceedings and claims, which arise in the ordinary course of business. As of December 31, 2019, the Company determined that there was not at least a reasonable possibility that it had incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to such proceedings. -----",,as_expected,2020,252,,

The Company assigns goodwill to four reporting units based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the business combination as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is not subject to ----- amortization; rather, the Company tests goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30 and whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. Impairment testing is performed for each of the reporting units by first assessing qualitative factors to see if further testing of goodwill is required. If the Company concludes that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount based on the qualitative assessment, then a quantitative test is required. The Company may also choose to bypass the qualitative assessment and perform the quantitative test. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the Company considers that goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value, there is an impairment of goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded. The Company calculates the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit less the carrying amount, including goodwill. Goodwill impairment would be limited to the carrying value of the goodwill. In performing the quantitative test, the Company measures the fair value of the reporting units to which goodwill is allocated using an income-based approach, a generally accepted valuation methodology, and relevant data available through and as of August 1, for the year ended September 30, 2019, and through and as of September 30, for the year ended September 30, 2018. Under the income approach, fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow method, projecting future cash flows of each reporting unit, as well as a terminal value, and discounting such cash flows at a rate of return that reflects the relative risk of the cash flows. The key estimates and factors used in this approach include, but are not limited to, revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal Company forecasts, discount rates, perpetuity growth rates, future capital expenditures, and working capital requirements, among others, and a review of comparable market multiples for the industry segment as well as historical operating trends for the Company. The Company completed the annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 1, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively, using a quantitative assessment approach. As a result of these respective annual assessments, the Company noted that the fair value of each reporting unit was determined to be in excess of the carrying value and as such, there were no impairment charges for the years ended September 30, 2019 or 2018.

The Company does not have any indefinite lived intangible assets other than goodwill. The intangible assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis using the sum of the years’ digits method over their estimated useful lives, which range from 3 to 20 years, reflecting the pattern in which the economic benefits are consumed or otherwise used up. The Company evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives of intangible assets. In cases where a revision is deemed appropriate, the remaining carrying amounts of the intangible assets are amortized over the revised remaining useful lives. The Company evaluates amortizable intangible assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable. If a triggering event suggests that a potential impairment has occurred, recoverability of these assets is assessed by evaluating the probability that future estimated undiscounted net cash flows will be less than the carrying amount of the long-lived assets.

A valuation allowance is established whenever management believes that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets may not be realizable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled. The realization of the net deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on estimated future taxable income. A change in the Company’s estimate of future taxable income may require an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance. A liability for uncertain tax positions is recorded whenever management believes it is not more-likely-than-not the position will be sustained on examination based solely on its technical merits. Interest and penalties related to underpayment of income taxes are classified as income tax expense. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as the Company has to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. The Company reevaluates these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit, voluntary settlements and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision. On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed and enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law in the form of H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Except for certain provisions, the Tax Act is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. As a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer, the majority of the provisions applied to the Company’s fiscal 2019, such as new limitations on certain business deductions, including the limitation on the Company’s interest expense deduction. For fiscal 2018 and effective in the three months ended December 31, 2017, the most significant impact included: lowering of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and remeasuring the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities. The phase in of the lower federal income tax rate resulted in a blended rate of 24.5% for fiscal 2018, as compared to the previous rate of 35%. The federal income tax rate was reduced to 21% in subsequent fiscal years. Because the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards and was not expected to owe federal tax in its fiscal year 2018 tax return, the remeasurement of deferred taxes recognized for the period was calculated using the future federal tax rate of 21%. During the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a $22.5 million net income tax benefit for the remeasurement of its deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company’s effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the recognition of this remeasurement.

In November 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-10, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815), and Leases (Topic 842), deferring the adoption date for private entities by an additional year. Therefore, the standard is effective for private entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021. Early application continues to be allowed. The standard requires lessees to present right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet.

The Company anticipates adopting the standard using the option provided by ASU 2018-11 and is evaluating the impact of the adoption of these ASU’s on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13- Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326). This ASU sets forth an expected credit loss model which requires the measurement of expected credit losses for financial instruments based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. This replaces the existing incurred loss model and is applicable to the measurement of credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost, and certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. For public entities, the updated standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal year. This ASU is effective for the Company as an EGC for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2022 and interim reporting periods beginning October 1, 2022. Early adoption is permitted. Assuming the Company remains an EGC, it intends to adopt the updated standard during its fiscal year ending September 30, 2022 and for interim periods within fiscal year beginning October 1, 2022. Adoption will require a modified retrospective transition. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of this ASU on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In May 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-05, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326), which provided certain improvements to ASU No. 2016-13.

The fair value option election does not apply to held-to-maturity debt securities. An entity that elects the fair value option should subsequently apply the guidance in Subtopics 820-10, Fair Value Measurement—Overall, and 825-10. For entities that have adopted the amendments in ASU No. 2016-13, the amendments in ASU No. 2019-05 are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years.

For public entities, the updated standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within that fiscal year. For the Company, as an EGC, the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim reporting periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption is permitted for all entities as of the beginning of an annual reporting period for which financial statements (interim or annual) have not been issued. Assuming the Company remains an EGC, it intends to adopt the updated standard during its fiscal year beginning October 1, 2019 and for interim periods within fiscal year beginning October 1, 2020. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the amendment and the impact it will have on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-13, Disclosure Framework—Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement, which amends Topic 820, Fair Value Measurement. ASU 2018-13 modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying, or adding certain disclosures. For all entities, this standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company intends to adopt the updated standard during its fiscal year beginning October 1, 2020 and for interim periods within fiscal year beginning in that fiscal year. The removed and modified disclosures will be adopted on a retrospective basis and the new disclosures will be adopted on a prospective basis. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this adoption will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other—Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That is a Service Contract. This ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. For public entities, the updated standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within that fiscal year. The amendments in this ASU are effective for the Company, as an EGC, for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020 and interim periods within annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The standard can be adopted either retrospectively or prospectively to all implementation costs incurred after the date of adoption. Early adoption is permitted. Assuming the Company remains an EGC, it intends to adopt the updated standard during its fiscal year beginning October 1, 2021 and for interim periods within fiscal year beginning October 1, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impact this adoption will have on its Consolidated Financial Statements.",,as_expected,2020,252,,

As of September 30, 2019, and 2018, unamortized deferred financing fees related to the Term Loan Agreement consisted of $9.1 million and $11.1 million, respectively. The Term Loan Agreement may be voluntarily prepaid in whole, or in part, in each case without premium or penalty (other than the Prepayment Premium (as defined in the Term Loan Agreement), if applicable), subject to certain customary conditions. The obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are secured by a first priority security interest in the membership interests of CPG International LLC owned by CPG Newco LLC and substantially all of the present and future assets of the borrowers and guarantors including equity interests of their domestic subsidiaries, subject to certain exceptions, (the “Term Loan Priority Collateral”) and a second priority lien on current assets. The obligations under the Term Loan Agreement are guaranteed by the Company and the wholly owned domestic subsidiaries of CPG International LLC other than certain immaterial subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries. The Term Loan Agreement requires mandatory prepayments of the term loans thereunder from certain debt issuances, certain asset dispositions (subject to certain reinvestment rights) and a percentage of excess cash flow (subject to step-downs upon CPG International LLC achieving certain leverage ratios). The estimated prepayment of excess cash flow was $6.4 million and zero at September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

The Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of (i) March 9, 2022 and (ii) 91 days prior to the maturity of the Term Loan Agreement, or the maturity of the Senior Notes, whichever occurs first. The Revolving Credit Facility provides for maximum aggregate borrowings of up to $150 million, subject to an asset-based borrowing base. The borrowing base is limited to a set percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory, less reserves that may be established by the administrative agent and the collateral agent in the exercise of their reasonable credit judgment. At September 30, 2019 and 2018, CPG International LLC had no outstanding borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility and had $3.0 million and $3.1 million of outstanding letters of credit held against the Revolving Credit, respectively. Deferred financing costs, net of accumulated amortization, related to the Revolving Credit Facility at September 30, 2019 and 2018 were $0.9 million and $1.2 million, respectively. CPG International LLC had approximately $113.7 million available under the borrowing base for future borrowings as of September 30, 2019. CPG International LLC also has the option to increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Agreement by up to $100.0 million, subject to certain conditions. ----- The Revolving Credit Facility provides for an interest rate on outstanding principal thereunder at a fluctuating rate, at CPG International LLC’s option, at (i) for ABR borrowings, the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate plus 50 basis points, (b) the prime rate and (c) the LIBOR as of such date for a deposit in U.S. dollars with a maturity of one month plus 100 basis points, plus, in each case, a spread of 50 to 100 basis points, based on average historical availability, or (ii) for Eurocurrency borrowings, adjusted LIBOR plus a spread of 150 to 200 basis points, based on average historical availability. A “commitment fee” accrues on any unused portion of the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility during the preceding three calendar month period. If the average daily used percentage is greater than 50%, the commitment fee equals 25 basis points, and if the average daily used percentage is less than or equal to 50%, the commitment fee equals 37.5 basis points. The commitment fees expenses were $0.5 million and $0.6 million for years ended September 30, 2019 and 2018. The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are guaranteed by CPG Newco LLC and its wholly owned domestic subsidiaries other than certain immaterial subsidiaries and other excluded subsidiaries. The obligations under the Revolving Credit Facility are secured by a first priority security interest in substantially all of the accounts receivable, inventory, deposit accounts, securities accounts and cash assets of CPG Newco LLC, CPG International LLC and the subsidiaries of CPG International LLC that are guarantors under the Revolving Credit Agreement, and the proceeds thereof (subject to certain exceptions) (the “Revolver Priority Collateral”), plus a second priority security interest in all of the Term Loan Priority Collateral. The Revolving Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid in whole, or in part, in each case without premium or penalty. CPG International LLC is also required to make mandatory prepayments (i) when aggregate borrowings exceed commitments or the applicable borrowing base and (ii) during “cash dominion,” which occurs if (a) the availability under the Revolving Credit Agreement is less than the greater of (i) $12.5 million and (ii) 10% of the lesser of (x) $150.0 million and (y) the borrowing base, for five consecutive business days or (b) certain events of default have occurred and are continuing. The Revolving Credit Facility contains affirmative covenants that are customary for financings of this type, including allowing the Revolver Administrative Agent to perform periodic field exams and appraisals to evaluate the borrowing base. The Revolving Credit Facility contains various negative covenants, including limitations on, subject to certain exceptions, the incurrence of indebtedness, the incurrence of liens, dispositions, investments, acquisitions, restricted payments, transactions with affiliates, as well as other negative covenants customary for financings of this type. The Revolving Credit Facility also includes a financial maintenance covenant, applicable only when the excess availability is less than the greater of (i) 10% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility and the borrowing base, and (ii) $12.5 million. In such circumstances, CPG International LLC would be required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Facility) for the trailing four quarters equal to at least 1.0 to 1.0; subject to CPG International LLC’s ability to make an equity cure (no more than twice in any four quarter period and up to five times over the life of the facility).

The Company records accretion expense in Cost of Sales in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss) in order to increase the value of the liability to reflect the future value of the warranty claims when they are actually settled. In addition, the Company records estimated warranty claims obligations related to current sales on an ongoing basis for the TimberTech product line. Pursuant to the TimberTech purchase agreement, the seller, Crane Group Companies Limited (“Crane”), also agreed to indemnify the Company for claims made up to seven years after the acquisition date for the majority of the costs to settle warranty claims for certain identified problems related to two products which have exhibited a high number of claims related to scorching and fading defects. The products were produced between 2010 and 2011 and have not been sold by the Company since 2011. Similar to its recognition of the warranty liability, the Company recorded an indemnification receivable from Crane on the acquisition date equal to the fair value of the indemnification calculated as the net present value of the expected indemnification payments to be received in the future.

The contingent payment was based on achievement of a minimum EBITDA amount and a multiple of EBITDA, for EBITDA exceeding a higher threshold for calendar year 2018. The potential minimum of the contingent payment would have been zero and the potential maximum would have been $30.0 million. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company paid the former owners of Ultralox $2.0 million as settlement of the contingent payment liability. At the date of acquisition (Note 3) the fair value was estimated to be $5.3 million. Of the fair value, $2.8 million is accounted for as contingent consideration in conjunction with the acquisition related to the non-employee owners, and the remaining $2.5 million (which was subsequently adjusted downward to $0.9 million due to changes in the estimated fair value of the contingent payment) has been recognized as compensation expense to the employee-owners from the date of acquisition through June 30, 2018 as the employee-owners forfeit their share of the contingent payment if they are not employed through that date. The contingent payment made was based on achievement of a minimum EBITDA amount and a multiple of EBITDA, for EBITDA exceeding a higher threshold for calendar 2018. The Company classified the contingent liability as Level 3, due to the lack of observable inputs. The significant assumptions made by the Company included a central estimate of EBITDA and EBITDA volatility of 39%. Changes in assumptions could have an impact on the payout of the contingent consideration payout amount. During the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company amended the earnout agreement to include two additional payments totaling $3.4 million to the former owners of Ultralox that are contingent upon the former owners continued employment through December 31, 2018 and 2019. These additional earnout payments are recognized as compensation expense over the required employment periods, since they are contingent upon future service from the date of the amendment. In addition, during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, the Company paid the former owners of Ultralox $1.7 million as partial settlement of the amended earnout agreement.

The estimated grant date fair values of both time vested and performance vested Profits Interests granted during 2019 and 2018, was derived using the option pricing method, which treats the various interests in the Partnership as call options with exercise prices determined based on their respective rights to participate in distributions by the Partnership. The values attributable to these implicit call options were determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The estimated grant date fair values of a time vested Profits Interests granted during 2019 and 2018, and the assumptions used for the Black-Scholes fair value model were as follows: ----- **2019** **2018** Estimated weighted average grant date fair value per Profits Interests granted .................... $399 $ 448 Assumptions: Risk-free interest rate ............................................................................................................ 1.75 - 2.81% 0.88 - 2.81% Expected term ....................................................................................................................... 2 years 2 - 3 years Expected volatility ................................................................................................................ 45.00% - 50.00% 45.00% - 55.00% Dividend yield....................................................................................................................... 0.00% 0.00% The expected term was based on the anticipated time to liquidity. The risk-free interest rate has been determined on the yields for U.S. Treasury securities for a period approximating the expected term. The expected volatility has been estimated based on the volatilities using a weighted peer group of companies that are deemed to be similar to the Company and is calculated using the expected term of the profit interests granted. Time vested Profits Interests generally vest in 20% increments on each of the first five anniversaries following the vesting commencement date, subject to continued employment; provided that the time vested Profits Interests may be redeemed by the Partnership for no value in the event that the awardee’s employment is terminated for cause or the awardee resigns without good reason prior to the third anniversary of the award’s grant date. In the event of a change in control, the vesting of outstanding time vested Profits Interests is accelerated. The compensation cost of time vested Profits Interests is determined based on the number of units granted and the fair value of the units at the grant date. That cost is expensed on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Information on time vested Profit Interests activity is as follows:",,as_expected,2020,252,,

The total liabilities associated with the unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the Company’s effective tax rate were $1.0 million and $0.9 million at September 30, 2019 and 2018, respectively. It is not anticipated that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits will change significantly over the next twelve months. When applicable, the Company’s practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions in income tax expense. For the years ended September 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 the amounts recognized by the Company for interest and penalties were not material. The corresponding liability recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2019 and 2018 was also not material. ----- The Company and its subsidiaries file U.S. federal income tax returns. The Company and its subsidiaries’ federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 and beyond are open tax years subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). The Company also has net operating loss carry-forwards from prior to 2013, which are subject to examination upon future utilization of such losses. The Company and its subsidiaries also file income tax returns in various state jurisdictions, as appropriate, with varying statutes of limitation. Certain subsidiaries file federal and provincial income tax returns in Canada. These returns are not material to the consolidated income tax provision. _US Tax Reform Legislation_ On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed into law H.R. 1, comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Except for certain provisions, the Tax Act is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. As a fiscal year U.S. taxpayer, the majority of the provisions, such as new limitations on certain business deductions, including the limitation on the Company’s interest expense deduction, applied to the Company beginning in fiscal 2019. For fiscal 2018 and effective in the three months ended December 31, 2017, the most significant impact included: lowering of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate and remeasuring certain net deferred tax assets and liabilities. The phase in of the lower corporate income tax rate resulted in a blended rate of 24.5% for fiscal 2018, as compared to the previous rate of 35%. The tax rate was reduced to 21% in subsequent fiscal years. Because the Company has net operating loss carry-forwards and was not expected to owe federal tax in the fiscal year 2018 tax return, the remeasurement of deferred taxes and the annual effective tax rate for the period are calculated using the future federal tax rate of 21%. In the year ended September 30, 2018, the Company recorded a $22.5 million net income tax benefit for the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. The Company’s effective tax rate was significantly impacted by the recognition of this remeasurement. In December 2017, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) which provided guidance on how companies should account for the tax effects related to the Tax Act. According to SAB 118, companies were to make a good faith effort to compute the impact of the Tax Act in a timely manner once the company obtained, prepared, and analyzed the information needed to complete their accounting requirements under ASC 740. The measurement period for SAB 118 ended December 22, 2018, and companies are now required to report the impact of the Tax Act using existing tax law and other sources of authority. The Company was able to record the impact of the Tax Act without using the measurement period provisions of the Tax Act. The material elements of the Tax Act are reflected in the rate reconciliation as final. Certain law changes from the Tax Act require the Company to analyze new items including, but not limited to, limitations on interest deductions and accelerated cost recovery of fixed assets. The Company has made policy decisions as to how to account for the tax effects of these items, as required by authoritative regulatory guidance, and will continue to analyze the impact as additional authoritative and technical guidance is issued and finalized at the federal and state levels. The Tax Act also revised the definition of “covered employees” who are subject to the $1.0 million limitation imposed on deductions for executive compensation paid by publicly-traded corporations. As a result, the limitation now applies to the chief executive officer, the chief financial officer, the three other highest- compensated employees and any employee who was a covered employee for any taxable year beginning after 2016. The Tax Act also eliminated the exception to this rule for commission or performance-based compensation paid to these covered employees. This new provision generally does not apply to compensation paid pursuant to a written contract in effect on or before November 3, 2017 that is not materially modified or renewed. Based on this new provision, if and when the Company becomes publicly traded, it will adjust its Deferred Tax Asset related to future stock compensation deductions for amounts that it does not expect it will be able to deduct in the future. The Company will continue to analyze executive compensation in future periods and adjust the Deferred Tax Asset for limitations of estimated future compensation deductions as information becomes available.",,as_expected,2020,252,,
