**Financial Information**

The audited consolidated annual financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements of Telenet Group Holding as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the nine months ended
September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, have in each case been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The
audited consolidated annual financial statements of Telenet Bidco as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001
have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The annual financial statements were audited under Belgian
generally accepted auditing standards. We have not included financial statements for Telenet Holding for the year
ended December 31, 2000 in this offering memorandum, but have prepared certain unaudited U.S. GAAP information
for Telenet Holding, which is included herein.

The audited consolidated annual financial statements of Telenet Bidco as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2001, reflect the results of Telenet Holding for the predecessor period prior to its acquisition by Telenet
Bidco in March 2001. The audited consolidated annual financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated
interim financial statements of Telenet Group Holding as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002 and the nine
months ended September 30, 2003 are not directly comparable to the audited consolidated annual financial statements
and unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Telenet Group Holding as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2001 and the nine months ended September 30, 2002 because of our acquisition of the cable
television businesses of the Mixed Intercommunales (the "MixtICS Acquisition") in August 2002. In addition, our
financial statements do not necessarily reflect what our financial results and positions may be in the future given,
among other things, our rapid growth to date, the continuing integration of MixtICS (including the related transfer of
certain personnel of Electrabel NV), our acquisition of Codenet NV and our pending acquisition of certain assets from
the Canal+ group. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—

-----

Current Developments."

Telenet Group Holding, which is the direct parent company of the Issuer, the Issuer and Telenet Bidco are
holding companies that do not conduct any business operations of their own. Substantially all the assets of Telenet
Group Holding consist of shares of the Issuer and intercompany loans originally made to the Issuer in connection with
the MixtICS Acquisition. These intercompany loans bear interest at a rate that mirrors the rate at which debt incurred
by Telenet Group Holding bears interest (historically, the shareholder funded debt incurred in connection with the
MixtICS Acquisition). Except for the impact of presenting as equity certain detachable warrants issued by Telenet
Group Holding, the financial position and results of operations of Telenet Group Holding are substantially the same as
the financial position and results of operations of the Issuer for relevant periods. Telenet Group Holding will not be
subject to the covenants or other provisions of the indenture governing the Notes, except that Telenet Group Holding
will guarantee the Notes on a senior basis.

The financial information included in this offering memorandum is not intended to comply with SEC reporting
requirements. Compliance with such requirements would require the modification or exclusion of certain financial
measures, including EBITDA, EBITDA margin, average revenue per subscriber, our annualized and pro forma data
and the presentation of certain other information not included herein including financial information for each of the
guarantors and historical and pro forma financial information for the MixtICS Acquisition.

EBITDA, EBITDA margin, average revenue per subscriber, cash interest expense, net cash pay debt and
certain other items included herein are non-GAAP measures and you should not consider such items as an alternative
to the applicable GAAP measures.

**Subscriber Data**

Each subscriber is counted as a revenue generating unit, or "RGU," for each service subscribed, regardless of
the number of services that customer receives from us. Thus, a subscriber who receives from us cable television,
broadband Internet and telephony services (regardless of their number of telephony access lines) would be counted as
three RGUs. The subscriber data included in this offering memorandum, including penetration rates, average revenue
per subscriber, market shares and churn rates, are derived from management estimates, are not part of our financial
statements and have not been audited or otherwise reviewed by an outside auditor, consultant or expert.

**Industry Data**

Certain economic and industry data used throughout this offering memorandum are derived from European
Union, Belgian government and various other industry data sources, which we believe to be reliable. Industry
publications generally state that the information they contain has been obtained from sources believed to be reliable, but
that the accuracy and completeness of such information is not guaranteed. We have not independently verified such
data.

Elsewhere in this offering memorandum, statements regarding our industry and our position in the industry are
based solely on our experience, our internal studies and estimates, studies done by third parties on our request and our
own investigation of market conditions. We cannot assure you that any of these assumptions are accurate or correctly
reflect our position in the industry, and none of our internal surveys or information has been verified by any independent
sources.

**Other Data**

Certain numerical figures included in this offering memorandum have been subject to rounding adjustments;
accordingly, numerical figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures
which precede them.

      - our ability to access the financial markets in order to refinance our debt;

      - unfavorable market pricing conditions for our existing and planned services and for competing
services;

      - increasing subscriber acquisition costs;

and digital television, or respond to technological developments;

      - our inability to market our existing and planned services to current and new customers;

      - difficulties and higher costs as we complete the integration of our recently acquired cable television
business into our operations;

      - the failure to maintain and upgrade the network we own or use or the occurrence of events that result
in damage to such networks;

      - our inability to obtain adequate supplies of telephony modems;

      - delays in the timing of the development and launch of our planned services;

      - difficulties as we integrate our acquisition of Codenet NV or complete or integrate our acquisition of
certain Flemish assets of the Canal+ group, or the failure to complete the Canal+ Acquisition;

      - upon completion of the acquisition of certain Flemish assets of Canal+ group, the failure to ensure
sufficient access to premium programming;

vii


-----

      - a restructuring of Cable Partners, which may result in a change of ownership of Cable Partners in the
near future;

      - conflicts of interest with our shareholders;

      - the significant litigation we are involved in with respect to interconnection and copyright fees;

      - adverse regulatory, legislative, tax or other judicial developments; and

      - factors that are not known to us at this time.

The cautionary statements set forth above should be considered in connection with any subsequent written or
oral forward-looking statements that we, or persons acting on our behalf, may issue. We do not undertake any
obligation to review or confirm analyst expectations or estimates or to release publicly any revisions to any
forward-looking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that arise after the date of this offering
memorandum.

We urge you to read the sections of this offering memorandum entitled "Risk Factors," "Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and "Business" for a more complete
discussion of the factors that could affect our future performance and the industry in which we operate. In light of
these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the forward-looking events described in this offering memorandum may not
occur.

**SUMMARY**

_This section contains a general summary of the more detailed information contained elsewhere in this_
_offering memorandum. You should read carefully the entire offering memorandum to understand our business,_
_the terms of the Notes, and the tax and other considerations that are important to your decision to invest in the_
_Notes. You should pay special attention to the "Risk Factors" section._

**Our Business**

We are the largest provider of broadband cable services in Belgium. Through our broadband network in the
Flanders region, we offer analog cable television, broadband Internet and telephony services, primarily to residential
subscribers.

      - **_Cable Television. Cable television is the principal medium for the provision of television services in_**
Flanders, and there is currently limited competition from satellite or terrestrial transmission of television signals in
Flanders or elsewhere in Belgium. Approximately 95% of television households in Belgium are passed by a cable
network. As of September 30, 2003, we had approximately 1.6 million subscribers to our analog cable television service
(receiving between 32 and 35 television channels), representing a penetration rate of approximately 94% of the homes
and businesses in Flanders passed by our network. As a result of our high penetration, our cable television business has
been stable and has provided us with a predictable source of revenues and cash flow.

      - **_Broadband Internet. We are the leading provider of residential broadband Internet services in_**
Flanders. As of September 30, 2003, we had approximately 368,000 residential broadband Internet subscribers which
contributed to our estimated market share of 53% and penetration rate of 15.5% in Flanders. We have grown from
approximately 253,000 subscribers and a penetration rate of 10.6% as of September 30, 2002. Through our hybrid fiber
coaxial-upgraded network, we offer our residential subscribers an "always on" broadband Internet service at a
downstream data transfer speed of up to 4 megabits per second, which is among the fastest speeds available to
residential customers in western Europe. We believe that the combination of the speed, stability and pricing of our
Internet offering has enabled us to grow faster than our competitors in Flanders.

      - **_Telephony. We offer our residential subscribers local, national and international long distance_**
telephony services as well as a variety of other related value-added services. As of September 30, 2003, we had
approximately 241,000 residential subscribers, which contributed to an estimated market share of 10% in Flanders
(based on number of lines). These results compared to approximately 221,000 residential subscribers as of
September 30, 2002. We achieved a penetration rate of 9.8% as of September 30, 2003, compared to a penetration
rate of 9.1% as of September 30, 2002. We believe that we are currently the largest competitor to Belgacom, the
Belgian incumbent, in Flanders.

For the three months ended September 30, 2003, our residential analog cable, broadband Internet and telephony
services (including interconnection revenues relating to both residential subscribers and business customers) accounted
for approximately 39%, 30% and 24% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. In addition, we offer our business
customers a range of Internet, data and voice services, which accounted for approximately 7% of our consolidated
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2003.

For the three months ended September 30, 2003, we generated annualized consolidated revenues and EBITDA
of [€506.8 million and € 252.8 million, respectively. See "]—Summary Financial Information and Operating Data."

Our broadband network passes approximately 1.7 million homes and businesses in Flanders. We are able to
offer cable television, broadband Internet and telephony services to subscribers whose homes are passed by our
network. In addition, we are also able to offer broadband Internet and telephony services to subscribers whose homes
are passed by the cable network of five publicly owned utilities (the pure intercommunales or "PICs") that operate in
Flanders (the "PICs Network" and, together with our owned network, the "Combined Network") pursuant to 50-year
usage rights, of which 43 years remain. The PICs Network passes approximately 800,000 additional homes and
businesses. Our network covers approximately 68% of homes and businesses passed by the Combined Network in
Flanders. We, in cooperation with our local municipal partners, recently completed the upgrade of the Combined
Network to a hybrid fiber coaxial ("HFC") standard that provides bi-directional capability, enabling us to transmit and
receive digital signals.

1


-----

Our high performance optical fiber network extends over 10,000 kilometers and the coaxial local loops of the
Combined Network reach over 52,000 kilometers throughout Flanders. We use our network to transmit television
signals and the Combined Network to carry telephony and Internet traffic to and from end users. We believe that we
have significant unutilized backbone capacity.

**Our Strengths**

      - **_High Penetration of Cable Television. Following an early introduction in the 1960s and 1970s, cable_**
television enjoys broad acceptance in Belgium. Approximately 95% of television households across Belgium are passed
by a cable network, compared to an average of approximately 43% of all television households across the European
Union. As of September 30, 2003, we provided cable television to approximately 94% of the homes and businesses in
Flanders passed by our network. These high penetration rates have allowed our cable television business to generate
relatively stable and predictable cash flows. Our cable television revenues have been enhanced by recent increases in
the fees charged to our subscribers.

      - **_Leader in Broadband Internet. We are the leading provider of residential broadband Internet_**
services in Flanders. As of September 30, 2003, we had approximately 368,000 residential subscribers, which
contributed to our estimated market share of 53% of all broadband Internet subscribers in Flanders. During the three
months ended September 30, 2003, we increased our market position by adding more than 26,000 net new subscribers.
We currently provide broadband Internet subscribers a downstream data transfer speed of up to 4 megabits per second
for a price of approximately [€42 per month (including VAT). We believe that the combination of speed, stability and]
pricing of our Internet offering compares favorably to other broadband Internet products such as digital subscriber
lines, or "DSL."

      - **_Fully Built-out and Recently Upgraded Network. The Combined Network has an extensive reach_**
in Flanders, passing approximately 2.5 million, or 94%, of the homes and businesses in Flanders. The Combined
Network includes our 10,000 kilometer high-capacity fiber backbone that spans Flanders. This backbone is linked via
head end stations and nodes to end users by local loops owned by us and the PICs that consist of 52,000 kilometers of
coaxial cable. The Combined Network has been upgraded to an HFC standard capable of transmitting bi-directional
digital data and offering a minimum capacity of 450MHz.

      - **_Strong Brand Recognition. Telenet is a well recognized brand in Flanders. Third-party research_**
commissioned by us indicates that consumers had over 95% aided brand awareness of Telenet as a provider of
Internet and fixed telephony services, and unaided brand awareness that varied between 60% and 80% depending on
the level of Telenet's promotional activities. A third-party customer survey that we commissioned also indicated that
customers recognize us for the quality of the products we offer.

      - **_Strong Management Team. Our management team has extensive experience in managing_**
technology businesses in competitive markets. Management is supported by a diverse group of shareholders, which
bring a combination of international telecommunications experience and local relationships to our operations. Our
shareholders include 15 Flemish intercommunales that have experience running local cable television networks, have
strong local relationships and an understanding of the Belgian regulatory environment.

**Our Strategy**

We seek to build on the existing reach of our cable television network to increase penetration rates of our
broadband Internet and telephony services. Our strategy is to continue to add value for our end users by providing high
quality products and superior levels of customer service. We aim to increase our operating cash flow by increasing our
subscriber base and the amount of revenue generated by each customer and by implementing cost-saving initiatives. To
achieve these objectives, we are pursuing the following strategies:

      - **_Continue to Grow our Subscriber Base. We aim to maintain our strong presence in cable television_**
and continue to increase our subscriber base and expand our market share in broadband Internet and telephony
services. We are especially focused on the residential broadband Internet market, which contributes incremental
revenues while generating low incremental costs. We utilize a range of promotions and brand marketing activities to
attract new subscribers.

-----

      - **_Prudent Deployment of Capital. We seek to make prudent capital expenditures and to deploy_**
proven technologies. The Combined Network has recently been upgraded to an HFC standard with bidirectional digital capability and passes approximately 2.5 million homes and businesses in Flanders.
We believe that the HFC upgrade and the reach of the Combined Network should limit the need for a
significant amount of capital expenditure for future upgrades. In addition, to reduce the risks frequently
associated with new product launches we seek to invest in proven products and technologies. We aim
to use technologies that operate on "open standards" in order to increase the compatibility of various
network components.

      - **_Improve Cash Flow and EBITDA Margin. We seek to improve our cash flow and EBITDA_**
margin primarily by growing our subscriber base and maximizing the amount of revenue generated by
each subscriber. In addition, we continue to focus on reducing our operating costs. We measure our
EBITDA margin as revenues net of operating expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) and
selling, general and administrative expenses taken as a percentage of revenues. Our EBITDA margin
increased from 18.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, to 46.6% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2003. We have reduced the amount of our bad debts, lowered network repair
and maintenance expenses and controlled the growth of our workforce. In the future, we plan to
improve our EBITDA margin by lowering the cost of customer acquisitions and customer service.

      - **_Continue to Focus on Quality and Customer Service. We view customer satisfaction as essential_**
to the maintenance of our existing subscriber base and pricing levels and our future prospects. We rely
on a number of metrics to evaluate the level of our customer service. One key factor is the average
time that our residential Internet and telephony subscribers wait to have their calls answered, which
was an average of approximately 30 seconds for the three months ended September 30, 2003. In order
to continue to reduce churn and enhance the quality of services we provide our subscribers, we have
customer retention teams that assist in the resolution of subscriber problems. We also intend to
introduce programs such as Telenet EasyCare™, which is a customer care computer program
designed to help subscribers find answers to certain common questions more quickly without having to
seek help from our call center. In addition, we regularly conduct customer surveys using internal and
third-party research organizations and continuously monitor competitor activity. We continuously invest
in product development to make our products and services more attractive. For example, we are in the
process of developing ExpressNet™, a high-speed broadband Internet product that we anticipate will
permit access to the Internet at speeds significantly faster than those we currently offer.

**Our History**

Our predecessor parent company, Telenet Holding, was incorporated in September 1996 to deliver telephony
services to residential subscribers in Flanders. In 1998 we began to deliver Internet services to residential subscribers
in Flanders. Since our acquisition of the cable television business from ten utility companies owned by municipalities
and Electrabel NV (mixed intercommunales or "MICs") in August 2002 (the "MixtICS Acquisition"), we have also
provided cable television to residential subscribers in Flanders connected to our network.

**Refinancing**

We are issuing the Notes as part of a refinancing plan, which we refer to as the "Refinancing." The
Refinancing includes:

      - the offering of the Notes and the application of the proceeds thereof as described in "Use of
Proceeds,"

      - the drawdown of a new, non-amortizing [€300] million tranche E under our senior credit facility to pay
down amortizing tranches A and B under our senior credit facility,

      - the drawdown of [€20] million under tranche C-2 of our senior credit facility to pay certain deferred
payment obligations, and

3


-----

            - the issuance of U.S. dollar denominated senior discount notes due 2014 by Telenet Group
Holding (the "Senior Discount Notes"), resulting in net proceeds in cash of approximately [€239.4]
million based on an exchange rate of $1.2382 = [€1.00.]

Such borrowings and Senior Discount Notes offering will happen concurrently with the issuance of the Notes. Prior to
the Refinancing, on November 3, 2003, Telenet Bidco drew an additional [€40] million on our senior credit facility,
€20 million of which was used to pay down tranche C-1 of the senior credit facility and €20 million of which was used
to repay certain deferred payment obligations. See "Use of Proceeds," "Capitalization" and "Description of Other
Indebtedness."

The following chart summarizes the expected sources and uses of the funds for the Refinancing:

**Amount** **Amount**

**Sources** **(euro in** **Uses** **(euro in**
**millions)** **millions)**
Funding under senior credit facility[(1)] ........ 320.0 Senior credit facility[(1)] .................................. 455.0

**Total.....................................................** 1,078.2 **Total..........................................................** 1,078.2

___________

(1) Includes the [€20] million that we intend to draw under tranche C-2 of our senior credit facility concurrently with the closing of this
offering and the creation of a new, non-amortizing tranche E under the senior credit facility which we intend to fully draw concurrently with the
closing of this offering and which will provide [€300] million to pay down amortizing tranches A and B under our senior credit facility. Excludes
€140 million of additional available borrowing capacity under our senior credit facility.

(2) Telenet Group Holding's Senior Discount Notes will be denominated in U.S. dollars and the amount of proceeds received therefrom will
be converted to euro at an exchange rate of U.S.$1.2382 = [€ 1.00.]

(3) €455.2 million includes the impact of accrued interest and deferred charges of approximately €20.0 million on the deferred payment
obligations and subordinated shareholder loans subsequent to September 30, 2003. We expect that [€205 million of the deferred payment]

obligations and subordinated shareholder loans will be paid through the proceeds of this offering with a further [€20 million repaid from amounts]

drawn under our senior credit facility. The remainder of the deferred payment obligations, together with subordinated shareholder loans, will be
repaid from the proceeds of the issuance of the Senior Discount Notes.

(4) We intend to apply [€100 million of the net cash proceeds of the Notes offered hereby to reduce our cash pay debt. To the extent that]

we do not use those proceeds to repay bank debt within 120 days after the completion of this offering, we will be obligated to offer to purchase
Notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. See "Description of the Notes—Par Offer."

(5) Includes approximately [€30 million of estimated fees and expenses related to this offering, approximately €18.8 million of estimated]

fees and expenses related to the offering of the Senior Discount Notes and a redemption premium of approximately [€9.2] million paid upon
repayment of certain of the subordinated shareholder loans and deferred payment obligations.

basis. As of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, the Subsidiary Guarantors, together with the Issuer and Telenet Group Holding,
would have represented 63.9%, 61.9% and 50.6% of our total assets, revenue and EBITDA, respectively. See "Annex C—Summary Guarantor
Financial Information."

**The Offering**

_The following summary contains basic information about the Notes. It may not contain all the information_
_that is important to you. For a more complete understanding of the terms of the Notes, please refer to the section_
_of this offering memorandum entitled "Description of the Notes" and particularly to those sub-sections to which_
_we have referred you._

Issuer............................................ Telenet Communications NV, a limited liability company organized under the laws
of Belgium.
Notes Offered................................ [€500,000,000 principal amount of 9% Senior Notes due 2013.]
Maturity Date ................................ December 15, 2013.
Interest.......................................... We will pay interest on the Notes at a rate of 9% per year, on June 15 and
December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2004.
Ranking of the Notes...................... The Notes will be secured senior indebtedness of the Issuer, will rank equally in
right of payment with all existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer and
will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future subordinated obligations
of the Issuer. The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any secured
indebtedness of the Issuer and its subsidiaries, including borrowings under the
senior credit facility, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such
indebtedness (other than to the extent that such assets also secure the Notes on an
equal and ratable or priority basis). The Notes will be effectively subordinated to all
indebtedness of the Issuer's subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors.
As of September 30, 2003, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing, the
Issuer had no indebtedness other than the Notes and intercompany indebtedness
owed to Telenet Group Holding.
The Issuer has no revenue-generating operations of its own and will depend upon
payments from Telenet Bidco (i) under an intercompany loan the Issuer will make
to it using a portion of the proceeds of the Notes offered by this offering
memorandum (the "Bidco Proceeds Loan"), (ii) under existing intercompany loans
that the Issuer has made to it (the "Existing Intercompany Loan") and (iii) in the
form of other loans, dividends and other distributions, to make payments on the
Notes. Bidco has no revenue-generating operations of its own and will depend on
cash flows received from its subsidiaries and payments under intercompany loans
made by Telenet Bidco to Telenet Operaties (the "Operaties Proceeds Loan") and
made by Telenet Operaties to MixtICS (the "MixtICS Proceeds Loan" and,
together with the Bidco Proceeds Loan, the Operaties Proceeds Loan and the
Existing Intercompany Loan, the "Proceeds Loans") to make payments to the
Issuer under the Bidco Proceeds Loan and the Existing Intercompany Loan.
Guarantors and Security.................. The Notes will be guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis (the "Subsidiary
Guarantees") by certain subsidiaries of the Issuer (the "Subsidiary Guarantors")
and on a senior basis by Telenet Group Holding. The Subsidiary Guarantors will
consist of our principal operating subsidiaries, other than MixtICS, which provides
our cable television services. MixtICS will guarantee the obligations of Telenet
Operaties under the Operaties Proceeds Loan. As of and for the nine months
ended September 30, 2003, the Subsidiary Guarantors, together with the Issuer and
Telenet Group Holding, would have represented 63.9%, 61.9% and 50.6% of our
total assets, revenue and EBITDA, respectively. See "Annex C—Summary
Guarantor Financial Information."
The Issuer's obligations under the Notes and the indenture and the obligations of
the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Subsidiary Guarantees and the indenture will
be secured by a second priority security interest in the shares of Telenet Bidco,
Telenet Operaties and MixtICS, respectively, pursuant to share pledges and by
second ranking pledges of receivables arising under the Proceeds Loans. These
security interests will be held by the Junior Security Agent as joint creditor,
together with the holders of the Notes, pursuant to an intercreditor agreement (the
"Intercreditor Agreement"). The Junior Security Agent for the Notes will hold the

9


-----

security and any proceeds of the security in trust for the benefit of the holders of
the Notes and the Trustee under the indenture governing the Notes. This security
will be pledged to the lenders under the senior credit facility on a first priority basis.
The second priority security interests under the share pledges and the pledges of
receivables arising under the Proceeds Loans will be subject to release under
certain circumstances. The Notes will also be secured by a first priority security
interest in receivables arising under a junior subordinated intercompany loan from
Telenet Group Holding to the Issuer. Subject to certain conditions, the indenture
governing the Notes will permit the Issuer and certain of its subsidiaries to secure
additional debt that the Issuer or such subsidiaries may issue, including any
additional Notes, with all or a portion of the security that secures the Notes.
Ranking of the Guarantees.............. Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be a senior subordinated obligation of the relevant
Subsidiary Guarantor. Accordingly, the Subsidiary Guarantees will:

                          - rank junior in right of payment to each Subsidiary Guarantor's existing and

ding any obligations in respect of the senior credit facility);

                          - rank pari passu in right of payment with any future senior subordinated

uarantors; and

                          - rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated indebtedness of the

In addition, each Subsidiary Guarantee of each Subsidiary Guarantor will
effectively rank junior in right of payment to its existing and future secured
obligations to the extent of the value of the collateral securing those obligations
(other than to the extent that such assets also secure the Notes on an equal and
ratable or priority basis) and the existing and future indebtedness and other
liabilities of its subsidiaries that are not Subsidiary Guarantors, except to the extent
of any debt owed to it by one of those subsidiaries, such as the MixtICS Proceeds
Loan and the guarantee of the Operaties Proceeds Loan by MixtICS. The
guarantee of the Operaties Proceeds Loan by MixtICS has a similar ranking to the
Subsidiary Guarantees.
The terms of the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that the Subsidiary
Guarantors will not be permitted to make payments in respect of their Subsidiary
Guarantees if a payment default has occurred and is continuing under the senior
credit facility or during the continuation of a payment blockage period.
Enforcement actions in respect of the Subsidiary Guarantees are also subject to a
standstill period imposed by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement. The
Subsidiary Guarantees will be subject to release under certain circumstances,
subject to compliance with certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement relating to procedures to be followed in connection with enforcement
sales.
As of September 30, 2003, after giving pro forma effect to the Refinancing, the
Subsidiary Guarantors would have had approximately [€840] million of indebtedness
under the senior credit facility (exclusive of undrawn facilities) that was senior in
right of payment to the Subsidiary Guarantees (approximately [€701] million of which
we anticipate would have been guaranteed by MixtICS on a basis that is senior in
right of payment to MixtICS's guarantee of the Operaties Proceeds Loan). The
indenture governing the Notes will permit the Issuer and its subsidiaries to incur a
significant amount of additional indebtedness, including senior indebtedness.
Additional Amounts........................ Subject to limited exceptions, the Issuer and each Subsidiary Guarantor will make
all payments in respect of the Notes, including principal and interest payments,
without deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes
or other governmental charges in Belgium, Luxembourg or any other relevant
taxing jurisdiction, unless it is obligated by law to deduct or withhold taxes or
governmental charges.
If the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor is obligated by law to deduct or withhold
taxes or government charges in respect of the Notes, the Issuer or the relevant
Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, will pay, subject to certain exceptions, the
holders of the Notes such additional amounts so that the net amount received by

10


-----

the holders after such deduction or withholding will not be less than the amount the
holders would have received if such taxes or government charges had not been
withheld or deducted.
Optional Redemption ...................... The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time before
December 15, 2008, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of the Notes to be redeemed, plus the applicable "make-whole" premium described
in this offering memorandum and accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.
The Issuer may redeem the Notes in whole or in part at any time on or after
December 15, 2008, at the redemption prices described under the heading
"Description of the Notes—Optional Redemption," plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption.
At any time prior to December 15, 2006, the Issuer may, on one or more
occasions, redeem up to 35% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes using
the net cash proceeds from certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to
109% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of redemption, so long as at least 65% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes remains outstanding after the redemption.
Optional Redemption for Tax
Reasons ...................................... If the Issuer becomes obligated to pay any additional amounts as a result of any
change in law of any relevant taxing jurisdiction which becomes effective after the
date on which the Notes are issued, the Issuer may redeem the Notes at its option
in whole, but not in part, at any time at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if
any, to the date of redemption.
Par Offer....................................... In the event that we do not apply at least [€100] million of the net cash proceeds of
the Notes offered hereby within 120 days after the date of the issuance of the
Notes to permanently prepay or repay certain bank indebtedness under the senior
credit facility, the Issuer will be obligated to make an offer to purchase Notes at
100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional
amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, to the extent of the amount by which the
reduction is less than [€100] million.
Certain Covenants.......................... The indenture governing the Notes and the guarantees of the Notes will, among
other things, restrict the ability of the Issuer and its restricted subsidiaries to:

                   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness,

                   - pay dividends or make other distributions, or redeem or repurchase equity
interests or subordinated obligations,

                  - make investments,

                     - sell assets, including the capital stock of subsidiaries,

                    - enter into sale/leaseback transactions,

                    - create liens,

                     - enter into agreements that restrict the restricted subsidiaries' ability to pay
dividends, transfer assets or make intercompany loans,

                     - merge or consolidate or transfer all or substantially all of its assets, and

                     - enter into transactions with affiliates.
All of these covenants are subject to a number of important qualifications. For
more details, see "Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants."
Change of Control.......................... If the Issuer experiences specific kinds of changes of control, you will have the
right to require the Issuer to repurchase your Notes at 101% of their principal
amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, to the date
of redemption. For more details, see "Description of the Notes—Change of
Control."

-----

Form of Notes................................ On the issue date, the Notes will be represented by one or more global notes in
bearer form. The global notes will be deposited with, and held by, the National
Bank of Belgium (the "NBB"), as operator of the X/N System, and 100% of the
interests therein will be held through the X/N System and its participants (including
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg). Definitive registered notes will be
issued in exchange for interests in the global notes held through the X/N System,
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg only under the circumstances set out under
"Book-Entry, Form, Clearance and Settlement—Issuance of Definitive Registered
Notes." Any such definitive registered notes issued in exchange for interests in the
global notes will not be eligible for settlement through the X/N System, Euroclear
or Clearstream, Luxembourg. Under no circumstances will definitive bearer notes
be issued to individual holders of interests in the global notes.
Clearance and Settlement ............... The Notes will be admitted for clearance and settlement in the X/N System. The
X/N System is accessible to investors and financial intermediaries through the X/N
System's participants, which include, among others, Euroclear, Clearstream,
Luxembourg and most credit institutions and securities firms established in
Belgium.
Transfers of book-entry interests in the Notes will be effected through the
book-entry facilities of the X/N System and its participants. Such transfers will be
conducted and settled in accordance with the usual rules and operating procedures
of the X/N System and its participants. When conducted through the X/N System,
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, such transfers will be settled in same-day
funds in the same manner as conventional eurobonds.
Interests in the Notes may be held only by eligible investors referred to in Article 4
of the Belgian Royal Decree of May 26, 1994 holding their Notes in an exempt
account with the X/N System or with a direct or indirect participant in such system,
as further described in "Certain Income Tax Considerations."
In order for the Notes to be traded on a fungible basis, each holder of Notes will be
deemed to agree to the application of the fungibility system provided for in Belgian
Royal Decree No. 62 of November 10, 1967 for the promotion of the circulation of
securities, as amended.
Disclosure of Certain Information
by the NBB................................. In principle, the NBB is bound by a duty of confidentiality. However, the NBB
may, to the extent required by U.S. or international regulations or treaties or
otherwise, disclose certain information relating to the identity of the holders of book
entry interests in the Notes and the amount of interests held in the X/N System
(through Euroclear, Clearstream, Luxembourg or directly).
No Prior Market............................. The Notes will be new securities for which there is currently no market. Although
the initial purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the
Notes, they are not obligated to do so and they may discontinue market-making at
any time without notice. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid market for
the Notes will develop or be maintained.
Listing ........................................... Application has been made to list the Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.
Governing Law for the Notes and
Guarantees.................................. The Notes and the guarantees of the Notes will be governed by the laws of the
State of New York.
Governing Law for the Intercreditor
Agreement and the Security
Documents.................................. The Intercreditor Agreement will be governed by English law. The share pledges
over the shares of Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties and MixtICS and the pledges
of the receivables arising under the Proceeds Loans and a junior subordinated
intercompany loan from Telenet Group Holding to the Issuer will be governed by
the laws of the Kingdom of Belgium.
Use of Proceeds ............................ We will use the proceeds from the offering of the Notes (i) to repay a portion of
our senior credit facility, (ii) to repay deferred payment obligations owed to certain
shareholders of Telenet Group Holding, (iii) for general corporate purposes and (iv)
to pay expenses of this offering. See "Use of Proceeds."

Telenet Bidco's acquisition of Telenet Holding in March 2001) and Telenet Group Holding is the successor company for the year
ended December 31, 2002.

(2) Includes interconnection fees generated by residential and business customers.

(3) Income tax expense was nil for the years ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001 and the nine months ended September 30,
2002, [€6,000 for the year ended December] 31, 2002 and [€26,000 for the nine months ended September] 30, 2003.

(4) Capital expenditure as presented here includes purchases of property and equipment, intangibles, and other investments, but excludes
the acquisition of network user rights under the Clientele Agreements and the Annuity Agreement. See "Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Liquidity and Capital Resources."

(5) Cash interest expense excludes non-cash items such as amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs and excludes expenses
such as currency hedging costs and other borrowing expenses, such as withholding tax and commitment fees. Cash pay debt includes
third party debt on which cash interest is payable from the date of issuance, and excludes the Senior Discount Notes on which interest
is accruing on a discounted basis and for which cash interest is not payable on issuance. _Pro forma cash interest expense is calculated_
assuming the following pro forma cash pay debt balances were outstanding for an annual period at rates in effect or assumed to be in
effect at September 30, 2003:


**_Pro forma_**
**principal**


**Annual pro forma cash**

**interest expense**

Cash and cash equivalents[(d)].................................................................................. (163.7)
Net cash pay debt ................................................................................................ 1,295.9

Senior Discount Notes[(e)]........................................................................................ 258.2

(a) The interest rate is calculated using the EURIBOR rate at September 30, 2003 of 2.128% plus the applicable margin,
excluding withholding tax, commitment fees on undrawn facilities and other borrowing expenses. Interest on tranches at
EURIBOR +3.50% has also been adjusted to reflect the impact of notional [€380.9] million of interest rate swaps, whereby
EURIBOR is received and a blended 4.24% fixed interest rate (as at September 30, 2003) is paid.

(b) Based on a rate of 9% for the Notes offered hereby.

(c) Interest is calculated using a blended rate of 7.13%, reflecting the profile of the components of these obligations which
include capital leases and clientele and annuity fees.

(d) We intend to apply [€100] million of the net cash proceeds of the Notes offered hereby to reduce our cash pay debt. To the
extent that we do not use those proceeds to repay bank debt within 120 days after the completion of this offering, we will be
obligated to offer to purchase the Notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
purchase. See "Description of the Notes—Par Offer."

(e) The Senior Discount Notes will accrete at the rate of 11.5% per annum to but excluding December 15, 2008, with cash
interest accruing on the Senior Discount Notes thereafter at a rate of 11.5% per annum, which would be approximately [€52]

million cash interest payable per annum (using an exchange rate of U.S.$1.2382 = [€1.00). Telenet G]roup Holding's Senior
Discount Notes will be denominated in U.S. dollars and the amount of proceeds received therefrom will be converted to euro
at an exchange rate of U.S.$1.2382 = [€1.00.]

Assuming an unfavorable 0.25% increase in interest applicable to the _pro forma balance of the senior credit facility, cash interest_
expense would increase by approximately [€2.1 million on an annual basis.]

(6) Annualized EBITDA is calculated by multiplying by four our EBITDA of [€63.2] million for the three months ended September 30,
2003. We believe this is a more useful measure of performance than our last twelve month or annual EBITDA, because it reflects the
benefit of cable subscriber price increases implemented during the past year and growth in our Internet and telephony businesses. See

cable television, broadband Internet and telephony services (regardless of their number of telephony access lines) would be counted as
three RGUs. RGUs are presented as of the relevant period end date.

(3) Our residential broadband Internet and telephony RGUs include households and small businesses with between one and four
employees ("SoHo"s) that receive our services through a coaxial connection.

(4) These amounts also include 7,500, 21,300 and 35,000 RGUs who used our carrier preselection services at December 31, 2000,
December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, respectively. These amounts also include 33,000, 32,000 and 29,000 RGUs who used our

SME telephony customers, respectively, at December 31, 2000, December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002, respectively. We
estimated that we had 15,000, 16,000 and 17,000 SME broadband Internet customers, and 4,000 SME telephony customers,
respectively, at March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003, respectively. SME and corporate RGUs that receive our
services using a fiber connection are not included in the above RGU statistics.

(6) Includes interconnection fees generated by residential and business customers.

(7) Number of RGUs at the end of the relevant period as a percentage of the number of homes and businesses, as applicable, passed by our

case of residential broadband Internet and telephony).

(8) Penetration rates estimated where limited data available.

(9) Includes SMEs that receive our broadband Internet and telephony services through a coaxial connection.

(10) Revenue earned for the period divided by the number of months in the period and divided by the average number of RGUs for the
period (which average number of RGUs may vary from the number of RGUs presented above at the period end date).

(11) Average monthly revenue per subscriber includes copyright fees and other revenue earned from carriage fees.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. Before purchasing the Notes, you should_
_consider carefully the specific risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this_
_offering memorandum. Any of the risks described below could have a material adverse impact on our business,_
_prospects, results of operations and financial condition and could therefore have a negative effect on the_
_trading price of the Notes and our ability to pay all or part of the interest or principal on the Notes. Additional_
_risks not currently known to us or that we now deem immaterial may also harm us and affect your investment._

**Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile**

**_Our substantial leverage and debt service obligations could materially adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_condition and results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under the Notes._**

We have substantial debt and debt service requirements and may incur additional debt in the future. As of
September 30, 2003, after giving effect to the Refinancing, we would have had total cash pay debt of [€ 1,459.6] million
on a consolidated basis (excluding available capacity under our senior credit facility and the Senior Discount Notes) as
compared to shareholders' equity of approximately [€718.4] million, and we are therefore considered highly leveraged.
As of that date, after giving effect to the Refinancing, [€840] million of debt would have been outstanding under our
senior credit facility, which debt is secured and guaranteed on a senior basis by our subsidiaries. We are also the
borrower under an intercompany loan of approximately $290 million from Telenet Group Holding, the economic terms
of which are substantially similar to the economic terms of the Senior Discount Notes, including payments of cash
interest beginning on June 15, 2009, subject to compliance with the terms of the indenture governing the Notes. You
should read the discussions under the headings "Capitalization" and "Description of Other Indebtedness" for further
information about our debt and the terms of the Senior Discount Notes.

Our high level of debt could have important consequences for you, including, but not limited to, the following:

      - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes, the senior credit
facility and other debt and liabilities;

      - requiring that a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations be dedicated to servicing debt,
thereby reducing the funds available to us to finance our operations, capital expenditures, research and
development and other business activities, including maintaining the quality of our network and the
network on which the PICs have granted us usage rights (the "PICs Network" and, together with our
network, the "Combined Network") and product performance;

      - impeding our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing, including financing for capital
expenditures, and increasing the cost of any such borrowing, particularly due to the financial and other
restrictive covenants contained in the agreements governing our debt;

      - impeding our ability to compete with other providers of cable television, Internet and data and
telephony services in Flanders or elsewhere in Belgium;

      - adversely affecting public perception of us and our brand; and

      - making us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments and giving us less
flexibility to react to changes in our business.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy our
debt obligations, including the Notes.

A portion of our debt, including all of our debt under the senior credit facility, bears interest at variable rates.
An increase in the interest rates on our debt will reduce the funds available to repay the Notes and our other debt and
to finance our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities and, as a result, will intensify the
consequences of our leveraged capital structure. In addition, under the terms of our existing interest rate hedging
arrangements, our effective interest rates may be higher than actual interest rates, resulting in increased costs for us.

23


-----

See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."

A portion of the proceeds from this offering will be used to repay our outstanding indebtedness, including
certain deferred payment obligations relating to our acquisition of the cable television business of the MICs in
August 2002. Although the Notes carry an interest rate that is lower than the weighted-average interest rate on these
deferred obligations, these deferred obligations allow for payment of interest in kind, through an increase in the principal
amount of the obligations, until July 1, 2005. Because interest under the Notes must be paid in cash, even though our
total interest expense will decrease, the amount of cash interest that we will be required to pay will increase. If the
Refinancing had been completed as of January 1, 2003, we estimate that we would have paid additional cash interest of
approximately [€29] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, excluding interest income generated on the
incremental cash balance resulting from the Refinancing and withholding tax, commitment fees, currency hedging costs
and other borrowing expenses.

Under the terms of tranches A and B of our senior credit facility, beginning on December 31, 2005 (after
giving effect to the Refinancing), we will be required to make quarterly payments of principal on loans representing an
aggregate principal amount of [€430] million, with the principal amounts to be repaid increasing over time and the final
payment, including all accrued interest, being due on December 31, 2009. In addition, any amounts outstanding under
tranche D of the senior credit facility, which is a [€100] million revolving facility, are payable in full on December 31,
2009, together with [€300] million under tranche E of the senior credit facility. Loans in an aggregate principal amount of
€150 million (€110 million drawn) under tranche C-2 of the senior credit facility are repayable in two equal installments
on June 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010. See "Description of Other Indebtedness—Senior Credit Facility."

Under the terms of our senior credit facility, we are required, among other things, to make gross-up payments
to non-resident lenders for interest payments made under the facility that are subject to Belgian withholding tax. For the
nine months ended September 30, 2003, we paid approximately [€2] million in gross-up payments. If we had been
required to make gross-up payments on interest paid to all of the lenders under our senior credit facility at the highest
withholding rate currently applicable under Belgian law, we would have paid approximately [€8] million in gross-up
payments for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. Our senior credit facility does not restrict transfers of
interests in the facility to non-residents of Belgium. If we had been required to make gross-up payments on interest
paid to all of the lenders under our senior credit facility at the highest withholding rate currently applicable under
Belgian law and if the Refinancing had taken place on January 1, 2003, we would have made payments of
approximately [€7] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—
Interest Rate and Related Risk."

If we cannot repay the loans under our senior credit facility when they become due, make the required
gross-up payments or refinance the loans on sufficiently favorable terms, we are unlikely to be able to make payments
of principal and interest on the Notes as they become due and payable.

The terms of the indenture governing the Notes will restrict, but will not prohibit, us from incurring additional
debt in the future. The terms of our senior credit facility also restrict, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional
debt. Those new borrowings could be senior to our obligations under the Notes. If new debt is added to our
consolidated debt described above, the related risks that we now face will intensify.

**_We may not generate sufficient cash flow to fund our capital expenditures, ongoing operations and debt_**
**_obligations, including our obligations under the Notes._**

Our ability to service our debt (including payments on the Notes) and to fund our ongoing operations will
depend on our ability to generate cash. We cannot assure you that our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow
from operations or that future debt or equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay
our debt obligations, including the Notes, when due. Our ability to generate cash flow is dependent on many factors,
including:

      - our future operating performance;

      - the demand and price levels for our current and planned products and services;

24


-----

      - general economic conditions and conditions affecting customer spending;

      - competition;

      - our ability to make use of our carry-forward tax losses;

      - the outcome of certain litigation in which we are involved; and

      - legal, tax and regulatory factors affecting our business.

Some of these factors are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not
be able to repay our debt, grow our business, respond to competitive challenges or fund our other liquidity and capital
needs, including capital expenditures. If we are unable to meet our debt service obligations, we may have to sell assets,
attempt to restructure or refinance our existing indebtedness or seek additional funding in the form of debt or equity
capital. We may not be able to do so on satisfactory terms, if at all.

Belgian tax law does not allow for group-wide consolidation. Each group member is deemed a separate entity
for tax purposes and intercompany transactions must be executed at arm's length conditions. Mismatches between
taxable income and deductible expenses (including interest on our debt) could adversely influence our ability to
generate cash flow. Likewise, changes in Belgian tax law or the interpretation of permitted transactions could
adversely affect our tax position and ability to utilize our carry-forward tax losses.

**_The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could adversely_**
**_affect our ability to operate our business and repay the Notes._**

The terms of our senior credit facility, the terms of our other outstanding debt and the indenture governing the
Notes contain a number of significant covenants or other provisions that could adversely affect the holders of the
Notes and our ability to operate our business. These covenants will restrict our ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries,
to, among other things:

      - pay dividends or make other distributions;

      - make certain investments or acquisitions, including participating in joint ventures;

      - make capital expenditures;

      - engage in transactions with affiliates and other related parties;

      - dispose of assets other than in the ordinary course of business;

      - merge with other companies;

      - incur additional debt and grant guarantees;

      - repurchase or redeem equity interests and subordinated debt;

      - grant liens and pledge assets; and

      - change our business plan.

Furthermore, our senior credit facility requires us to maintain specified financial ratios and meet financial tests.
Notwithstanding our intent to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to repay our indebtedness, these financial
ratios will tighten and may become more difficult to maintain over time. Our ability to comply with these provisions may
be affected by events beyond our control. If we cannot comply with these tests or are otherwise in default, our group
may not be able to borrow under the senior credit facility, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to
operate our business and to make payments under our debt instruments.

25


-----

In addition to limiting our flexibility in operating our business, the breach of any covenants or obligations under
the agreements and instruments governing our debt will result in a default under the applicable debt agreement or
instrument and could trigger acceleration of the related debt, which in turn could trigger defaults under other
agreements governing our debt. In addition, the lenders under our senior credit facility could foreclose on their
collateral, which includes equity interests in our operating subsidiaries, exercise other rights of secured creditors and
deny us access to any unused amounts under the facility. A default under our senior credit facility or under the
agreements governing our other debt could materially adversely affect our growth, our financial condition and results of
operations and result in our not having sufficient assets to make payments on the Notes and other debt. See
"Description of Other Indebtedness."

**_We have incurred negative cash flow after interest and taxes and substantial operating and net losses to date_**
**_and expect to continue to report losses for the foreseeable future._**

We have not made a profit since the Telenet group was formed in 1996 and expect to continue to report losses
for the foreseeable future. We have a history of negative net cash flows after deducting interest and taxes, and we
may not generate positive cash flows in the future. On a consolidated basis, we reported net losses of [€327.8] million in
2001, [€864.4] million in 2002 and [€430.4] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. Although a substantial
portion of these losses consists of depreciation and amortization expenses that do not directly impact our cash flow,
continued losses may limit our ability to engage in equity or debt financings in the future. In addition, we made cash
payments as part of our acquisition of Codenet NV ("Codenet") and expect to make payments in connection with our
pending acquisition of the Flemish assets from the Canal+ group (the "Canal+ Assets"), which have had and will have a
negative impact on our cash flow, and we cannot guarantee that these operations will generate positive cash flows in
the future. For more information about our recent results, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations."

**_Our historical financial information may not be representative of our actual results, given the recent MixtICS_**
**_Acquisition, its pending integration with Telenet and other factors._**

We completed the MixtICS Acquisition in August 2002 and our financial statements only reflect the results of
MixtICS since that date. We have not presented the MixtICS historical results on a stand-alone basis given that, prior
to its acquisition, the MixtICS business was separately owned by different municipalities and operated on their behalf
by Electrabel NV ("Electrabel"). In addition, the integration of MixtICS into Telenet has not been completed, and many
of the operations of MixtICS are conducted on our behalf by Electrabel employees pursuant to a services and transfer
agreement entered into at the time of the acquisition. The cost allocations by Electrabel under this agreement may not
accurately reflect what we would have had to pay for Electrabel's services if we had obtained them from third parties
or what we will have to pay for these services in the future if we obtain them from third parties. We expect to
experience a slight increase in certain costs (such as for insurance) following the integration of the cable television
business into our operations. Accordingly, you should not rely on our historical financial statements as indicative of our
actual financial results or condition. In addition, our financial statements do not necessarily reflect what our financial
results and condition may be in the future given, among other things, our rapid growth to date, the continuing integration
of the MixtICS Acquisition (including the assumption of liabilities associated with the transfer of employees to MixtICS
from Electrabel) and our acquisition of Codenet and our pending acquisition of the Canal+ Assets, which we expect
may negatively affect our financial results beginning for the three months ended December 31, 2003. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Current Developments"
and "Our History—MixtICS Acquisition."

**_We are contractually obligated to commercially launch a digital television platform by March 2005, and our_**
**_financial condition and cash flows may be impaired by our efforts to launch digital television and any_**
**_liability we incur if we fail to launch digital television._**

At the time of our acquisition by Cable Partners Europe, LLC, we agreed with the MICs to launch a digital
platform. It was agreed that this would be done in phases. The first phase, which was to last 12 months, required us to
develop products, build the digital platform and prepare back and front office processes and systems for digital
television ("DTV") operations. The second phase was to last six months, during which time we were to conduct DTV
trials in a part of our network in order to gather market acceptance and information and further tailor our DTV
commercial strategy. The third phase, initially due to begin at the end of 2002 and to last for 12 months, required us to

26


-----

achieve a full commercial launch of DTV products. In addition we are required to comply with certain subscriber
penetration requirements.

Although we believe we have completed the first phase and are now engaged in the second phase and our
obligation is being amended to extend the time for completion of all three phases to March 2005, we may not be able to
launch DTV by that date. Our senior credit facility includes limits on both the amount and nature of any funding of
DTV and also requires the development of a business plan. As DTV is not currently included in our business plan, we
may not be able to develop a feasible business plan for the launch of DTV. Further, if the launch requires funding
beyond the limited amounts permitted by our senior credit facility we would need the approval of the senior banks. Our
financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected by our efforts to launch DTV. See "—Risks Related to
Our Business—If we fail to successfully introduce new technologies or services, such as VoIP telephony, or to
respond to technological developments, our business and level of revenues may be adversely affected."

If we fail to successfully launch DTV in the required timeframe we will be liable to the MICs for all
foreseeable liabilities and losses they incur as a result of breach of contract subject to a maximum amount of [€]
80 million. This will be so even if the banks have effectively blocked our ability to finance and launch DTV.

**_Termination of our rights of usage of the cable network in Flanders owned by five pure intercommunales (the_**
**_"PICs") may adversely affect our operations and substantially lower the value of our assets in case of a_**
**_bankruptcy or liquidation._**

In September 1996, the PICs, through Interkabel Vlaanderen CVBA ("Interkabel"), granted Telenet
Vlaanderen certain usage rights to their cable networks in return for shares in Telenet Vlaanderen (which have since
been exchanged for shares of Telenet Group Holding). In turn, Telenet Vlaanderen has granted Telenet Operaties the
exclusive rights to use Telenet Vlaanderen's rights to the cable network, through which Telenet Operaties is able to sell
telephony and broadband Internet services to homes passed by the PICs Network. Under the terms of the deed by
which Interkabel contributed these rights to Telenet Vlaanderen, the rights will automatically terminate if, among other
things, either Telenet Holding, Telenet Vlaanderen or Telenet Operaties is declared bankrupt or put into liquidation. See
"Business—The Combined Network—Our Usage Rights on the PICs Network." Consequently, there is a risk that we
will no longer be able to use the PICs Network, which allows us to reach approximately 32% of the homes and
businesses passed by the Combined Network. If we do not have access to the PICs Network, our operations, the value
of our assets or business in a sale thereof and your ability to recover your investment in the Notes may be negatively
affected.

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_The Belgian Internet, data and telephony industries are highly competitive and the television industry may_**
**_become more competitive in the future, which could result in lower prices and the loss of subscribers._**

We face significant competition from established and new competitors who provide Internet, data and
telephony services. In some instances, we compete against companies with fewer regulatory burdens, easier access to
financing, more comprehensive product ranges, greater personnel resources, wider geographical coverage, greater
brand name recognition and experience or longer-established relationships with regulatory authorities and customers.
Such competition may create downward pressure on prices similar to that experienced elsewhere in Europe, which
may result in a decrease of our average revenue per subscriber, as well as a loss of subscribers, and increased content
costs for cable television.

_Internet. Our residential high-speed broadband Internet service competes with companies that provide lower-_
cost (or even free), slower connections to the Internet over traditional telephone lines as well as with competitors,
including Belgacom (the telephony incumbent in Belgium), that provide high-speed broadband access over digital
subscriber lines ("DSL "). Belgium has recently seen the introduction of new competition from "light" DSL Internet
services that were launched in December 2003. These services, which have already been introduced in other European
countries, offer connectivity at slower speeds in exchange for significantly lower prices than we charge for the service
that we currently offer. Such products may prove effective, which could adversely affect our sales and churn and
create greater price competition in the Belgian market. Additional competition may come from satellite and wireless
technologies. We expect competition, including price competition, from current providers, new startups and other
companies to increase in the future.

27


-----

_Telephony. Competition in providing residential telephony service is intense. Our principal competitor in the_
Flemish residential market is Belgacom, which has an extensive telephone network throughout Belgium, strong market
knowledge, high brand recognition and substantial capital resources. As of September 30, 2003, Belgacom had
approximately 80% of the fixed-line telephony market in Flanders. Belgacom may use its substantial capital resources
to aggressively reduce prices. In addition, Belgacom recently announced the planned merger of its retail and wholesale
divisions, which we believe may lead to lower retail prices. While Belgacom is our major competitor, we depend on
Belgacom to provide certain services to our customers, including number portability, and to connect calls made by our
customers to customers of Belgacom. Belgacom is subject to extensive regulation due to its dominant position in the
fixed telephony market; however, our current proceedings against Belgacom or other factors may adversely affect our
relations with Belgacom and negatively impact our competitive position. We also face growing competition from new
competitors entering the telephony market, such as Tele 2, which offers a carrier preselect service. Many of these
entrants have substantial resources and experience conducting telephony operations elsewhere in Europe.

Mobile telephony services, including planned third generation technology, and wireless local loop operators
contribute to the competitive pressures that we face. Increasing numbers of users are substituting mobile telephone
lines for fixed telephone lines, which may negatively affect our call usage volumes and subscriber growth. As
interconnection rates for calls made to mobile networks are significantly higher than rates for calls that terminate on
fixed lines, increased usage of mobile lines may also decrease the profitability of our residential telephony business.

The ongoing unbundling of the Belgacom local loop and the potential unbundling of the cable network, the use
of carrier preselect services that allow entities to provide telephony services over the networks of other operators and
the introduction of new technologies such as Voice over Internet Protocol ("VoIP") may also increase the number of
competitors. As new competitors enter the market and prices decrease in line with the downward pressure on
telephony prices experienced elsewhere in Europe, our telephony business may become less profitable and experience
a decline in revenues and market share.

Certain of our telephony competitors, including Belgacom, engage in "tromboning," a practice which consists of
diverting abroad calls that originate in Belgium and then routing the calls back to Belgium in order to qualify for reduced
international interconnection fees. Increased tromboning by competitors could have an adverse impact on our revenues
and profitability. See “Regulation—Telephony Regulation—Interconnection” for more information. We have recently
sought to include prohibitions on tromboning in interconnection agreements that we enter with certain other telephony
providers, but because of the difficulty in proving that tromboning has occurred, the effectiveness of these contractual
restrictions is uncertain.

_Cable Television. Our cable television service does not currently compete with other television and video_
services on a significant scale, due in part to the high penetration rate of cable in Flanders. In the future, however, we
believe it is likely that Belgacom will introduce a streaming video on demand product over its established telephone
network. In addition, we may face increased competition from DSL, multi-channel satellite, digital terrestrial and other
means of delivering multiple programming. Although none of these options has been deployed on a commercial scale in
Belgium to date, many of these technologies have been effectively deployed elsewhere in Europe and may allow
better-capitalized competitors to enter the market and offer a greater variety of channel packages and programming
than we currently provide on our analog network. In addition, future legislation may require us to provide competitors
access to our network for purposes of providing broadcasting services at regulated prices, which would strengthen our
competitors by granting them access and lowering their costs to enter into the cable television business. See "—Risks
Related to Regulatory and Legislative Matters—We may become subject to more extensive regulation if we are
deemed to possess significant market power in any of the markets in which we operate."

_Business Services. Competition in the provision of Internet, data and voice products to business customers is_
intense, with Belgacom and major international companies with established market presences, such as Colt, MCI,
Versatel and BT, being the primary competitors. We have previously been limited in competing for business customers
because the Combined Network does not reach outside Flanders. Although we believe that our acquisition of Codenet
will provide us with the scale and geographic scope necessary to compete more effectively, we have not previously
operated a network in the French-speaking region of Belgium and have limited experience providing Internet, data and
voice services on a national level. We may experience unanticipated difficulties in establishing and maintaining a
nationwide market presence in light of the substantial competition.

Our business is characterized by rapid technological change and the introduction of new products and services.
If any new or enhanced technologies, products or services that we introduce, such as those associated with the
deployment of VoIP telephony or digital television, fail to achieve market acceptance or experience technical
difficulties, our revenue growth, margins and cash flows may be adversely affected. As a result, we may not recover
investments that we make in order to deploy these technologies and services. In addition, enhanced television,
telephony, Internet and data services provided by competing operators may be more appealing to customers. See "—
The Belgian Internet, data and telephony industries are highly competitive and the television industry may become more
competitive in the future, which could result in lower prices and the loss of subscribers." New or existing competitors
may also rely on new or enhanced technologies, such as telephony based on VoIP technology, to offer standard
services at lower prices or to offer new, more attractive services. We may not be able to fund the capital expenditures
necessary to keep pace with technological developments. Our inability to obtain the funding or other resources
necessary to expand or further upgrade our systems and provide advanced services in a timely manner, or successfully
anticipate the demands of the marketplace, could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and
generate revenue.

In particular, we expect to introduce VoIP telephony by the fourth quarter of 2004 in order, among other
things, to address a supply shortage of certain telephony modems that we use. See "—The Combined Network and
systems depend on equipment and service suppliers that may discontinue their products or seek to charge us prices that
are not competitive, either of which may adversely affect our business and profitability." Although other operators have
commercially deployed VoIP telephony on a limited basis, it has yet to be used on a substantial scale and various
difficulties have been encountered. Scalability, network compatibility or other practical problems may arise that could
interfere with or delay our planned roll-out of VoIP telephony. We expect to begin conducting VoIP trials in the second
quarter of 2004.

We are also conducting trials in anticipation of launching an interactive digital television ("iDTV") service in
conjunction with certain broadcasters, the Flemish government and other potential partners. We face significant
technological, operational and market risks that may limit a successful launch of iDTV in Flanders. It is difficult to
predict how subscribers will respond to and how to price new interactive features and other products and services that
can be offered with iDTV. The cost structure of an iDTV offering is also uncertain, particularly in terms of access to,
and prices for, content. The commercial launch by us of any iDTV platform would require additional funding and is
subject to the approval of two-thirds of the lenders under our senior credit facility, as it would involve capital
expenditures on network equipment and set-top boxes. In addition, if we plan to offer iDTV to subscribers on the PICs
Network, we will need to negotiate with the PICs the terms and conditions on which such services are supplied. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
Resources—Capital Expenditure." See "—Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile—Termination of our rights of usage
of the cable network in Flanders owned by five pure intercommunales (the "PICs") may adversely affect our
operations and substantially lower the value of our assets in case of a bankruptcy or liquidation."

**_The Combined Network and systems depend on equipment and service suppliers that may discontinue their_**
**_products or seek to charge us prices that are not competitive, either of which may adversely affect our_**
**_business and profitability._**

We have important relationships with several suppliers of hardware and services that we use to operate the
Combined Network and systems. In many cases, we have made substantial investments in the equipment or software
of a particular supplier, making it difficult for us to change supply and maintenance relationships in the event that our
initial supplier refuses to offer us favorable prices or ceases to produce equipment or provide the support that the
Combined Network requires.

Approximately 60% of our residential telephony subscribers are served by Motorola modems that use a
proprietary technology to communicate between the end user and our head end stations. Motorola has discontinued
production of those telephony modems, depriving us of hardware that we will need to continue to grow our telephony
subscriber base. Meanwhile, the principal supplier of our remaining residential telephony modems, Terayon, has ceased
development activities with respect to these modems, although it has not discontinued production. In each case, in order
to move to other modem suppliers, we need to install additional equipment in our head end stations. Although we have

29


-----

obtained additional Motorola modems from the excess inventory of other telephony service providers (for an aggregate
per unit price exceeding the price we previously paid to Motorola, however) and are beginning to retrieve and recycle
Motorola modems from subscribers who no longer use our telephony services, we anticipate that even with these
alternative sources of supply, by the third quarter of 2004 we will no longer be able to connect new telephony
subscribers in those areas served by Motorola modems. This supply shortfall would limit our ability to grow our
telephony business.

By the fourth quarter of 2004, we expect to introduce VoIP technology based on an open standards platform
that will significantly reduce our reliance on proprietary technologies. We may, however, experience difficulties or
delays in introducing this technology, which would heighten the impact of the shortage of Motorola telephony modems
and any future shortage of telephony modems provided by our other principal supplier. Although VoIP has been
commercially deployed on a limited basis by a few operators, we may not be successful in deploying VoIP on time and
at our expected cost. The operating results of our telephony business will likely be negatively impacted if VoIP is not
successfully introduced within our projected timeframe.

Furthermore, we are also dependent on Motorola for a significant portion of our other equipment. Under a
framework agreement with Motorola, we have designated Motorola as our preferred supplier of high-speed data
modems, digital set top boxes and related head end equipment and we have agreed to purchase from Motorola on an
annual basis at least 30%, and over the term of the framework agreement, at least 50%, of our requirements for
modems (including VoIP modems) and any set top boxes required for iDTV until March 29, 2006. We cannot use
digital set top boxes from any other vendor until at least six months after we have deployed Motorola's boxes. We have
also agreed to deploy Motorola's proprietary conditional access system across the Combined Network. See
"Business—Supply and Installation." If for any reason Motorola does not continue to supply such products or
proprietary technology to us, we may have to find alternate suppliers, which could result in higher costs than those
under our current arrangement with Motorola. Furthermore, Motorola's equipment, which we must purchase, may not
be optimal for our purposes or may be more expensive than equipment available from other suppliers, which can put us
at a competitive disadvantage and harm our business.

**_We may experience difficulties and higher costs as we complete the integration of our recently acquired cable_**
**_television business into our operations._**

Our ability to effectively integrate the cable television business into our operations is essential to our future
success. We are focused on incorporating the customer service, maintenance, repair, installation, employee, financial
control, information technology, know-how, subscriber data, billing and other aspects of MixtICS into our operations by
the middle of 2004, in accordance with an integration plan that groups functions according to scheduled phase-in dates.
In line with this plan, we are already managing the MixtICS business and have mostly integrated the network
maintenance and repair functions and are in the process of integrating the remaining services in further stages. To date,
most of the cable business services have been provided to us by Electrabel, the former operator of the MICs cable
systems, pursuant to a services and transfer agreement between Electrabel and MixtICS. As we complete the
integration of MixtICS, we anticipate incurring some additional costs as compared with expenses charged by Electrabel
under the services and transfer agreement. The level of additional costs may be higher than we expect.

The outstanding tasks involved in the integration of MixtICS with our other operations remains a substantial
undertaking, which may result in unexpected difficulties and cost more than we expect. In particular, the migration of
subscriber data and billing for cable television services currently provided by Electrabel to us, and the combination of
our subscriber data and billing systems into a uniform platform, may result in a loss of subscriber data, billing errors and
delays, which could negatively impact our cash flows and customer relationships. The integration of financial control
systems and the standardization of accounting practices between our business and that of MixtICS may present
additional challenges.

Concurrently with the integration of MixtICS, we plan to migrate all of our businesses, including MixtICS, to an
integrated data management and reporting platform using Oracle enterprise resource planning ("ERP") software. The
initial introduction of an ERP system increases the potential for losses, errors and delays in our data collection and
customer services, any of which could adversely affect our business.

Under the services and transfer agreement between Electrabel and MixtICS, the portion of Electrabel's
existing employee base that was assigned to MixtICS is scheduled to be transferred to us during the first quarter of

30


-----

2004, although we may seek to extend the transfer date to the start of the second quarter of 2004 based on operational
considerations. Because these employees have been part of a different work culture, their continued integration into
Telenet may present complications that affect our operations and will require us to incur additional training costs.
Integration difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business and on our ability to make payments on the
Notes.

**_Failure to maintain and upgrade the Combined Network or make other network improvements, or the_**
**_occurrence of events that result in damage to the Combined Network, could have a material adverse_**
**_effect on our operations and impair our financial condition._**

We and our local municipal partners recently upgraded the Combined Network to a hybrid fiber coaxial
("HFC") standard with bi-directional digital capabilities. In 2004, we anticipate capital expenditure of between [€]
140 million to [€160] million. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditure." Our assumptions regarding the costs associated
with maintenance and upgrades of the Combined Network and our coaxial network may prove to be inaccurate,
including if we are unable in the future to effectively reduce the number of homes served by each node in our network,
which should enable us to relieve local network capacity constraints. If capital expenditure exceeds our projections or
our operating cash flow is lower than expected, we may be required to seek additional financing. Our inability to secure
additional financing may adversely affect capital expenditure and operational plans. As part of our upstream capacity
upgrade, our subscribers will have to retune their television sets. Subscribers may have difficulty doing this, which could
result in negative publicity and greater expense associated with the upgrade.

If any part of the Combined Network is subject to a flood, fire or other natural disaster, terrorism, a power loss,
or other catastrophe, our operations and customer relations could be materially adversely affected. Although our
network is built in resilient rings to ensure the continuity of network availability in the event of any damage to our
underground fibers, if any ring is cut twice in different locations, transmission signals will not be able to pass through,
which could cause significant damage to our business. Disaster recovery, security and service continuity protection
measures that we have or may in the future undertake, and our monitoring of network performance from our network
operating center in Mechelen, may be insufficient to prevent losses. In the event of a power outage or other shortage,
we do not have a back-up or alternative supply source. A power outage in one segment of the network could cause the
entire network to shut down. In addition, our business is dependent on certain sophisticated critical systems, including
our switches, billing and customer service systems. The hardware supporting those systems is housed in a relatively
small number of locations and if damage were to occur to any of such locations, or if those systems develop other
problems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not insure the coaxial portion of our network.
Any catastrophe or other damage that affects our coaxial network could result in substantial uninsured losses.

**_Our pending acquisition of the Canal+ Assets and our acquisition of Codenet pose significant challenges, and_**
**_difficulties integrating either acquisition may adversely affect our operating results._**

Our pending acquisition of the Canal+ Assets and our recent acquisition of Codenet pose significant
management and financial challenges. These include:

      - integration of the acquired businesses in a cost-effective manner, including network infrastructure,
management information and financial control systems, marketing, customer service and product
offerings;

      - outstanding or unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual, labor or other issues arising from the
acquisitions;

      - retention of customers and maintenance of brand recognition;

      - integration of different company and management cultures; and

      - retention, hiring and training of key personnel, particularly because we may need to hire additional
employees to help operate the Flemish Canal+ Assets (in addition to the Canal+ employees being
transferred to Telenet).

31


-----

These challenges could strain our management and financial resources. If we cannot successfully integrate
these acquisitions on a timely and efficient basis and retain or hire key personnel, we may incur higher than expected
costs and not realize all the benefits of these acquisitions. Integration or other acquisition difficulties could have a
material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our operating margins will be
lower following the completion of the acquisitions. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Current Developments."

**_Conditions imposed on the Canal+ Acquisition, a failure to complete the Canal+ Acquisition or the inability to_**
**_ensure sufficient access to premium programming could have an adverse effect on our operating_**
**_results._**

Although the Belgian competition authority (Raad voor de Mededinging) has approved our acquisition of the
Canal+ Assets (the "Canal+ Acquisition"), it has imposed several conditions on its implementation that require us,
among other things, to grant other premium television service providers access to our network on commercially
reasonable terms and to offer the Canal+ premium service to other television network operators which could be our
competitors. We also cannot enter into contracts with broadcasters that make us the exclusive distributor of their
signal. These requirements may constrain our ability to market the Canal+ offering and to maximize the use of our
network by requiring us to devote bandwidth to services of competing providers. In addition, the decision of the Belgian
competition authority authorizing our acquisition of the Canal+ Assets may be appealed within 30 days from the
publication of the decision in the Belgian Official Gazette (Belgisch Staatsblad). Such an appeal, if successful, could
increase the number of conditions to which we would be subject in connection with our operation of the Canal+ Assets,
or could even disallow the acquisition altogether. See "Business—Our Products and Services—Cable Television—
Premium Services."

Our acquisition of the Canal+ Assets is also subject to a number of contractual conditions, including the sale to
other third parties of the assets of Canal+ in the French-speaking region of Belgium. In addition, we need to obtain
consents from the relevant movie studios and certain other suppliers of programming rights to Canal+. These parties
may not provide such consents, or may renegotiate the terms of the contracts in connection with granting the required
consents. As our core business is content distribution and not content programming, in the longer term we may transfer
the programming rights to a third party, although we would expect to retain access to the transferred content. Any such
transfer would also require consent from the relevant movie studios and other suppliers of programming rights, as well
as the consent of the Belgian competition authority.

A failure to complete the Canal+ Acquisition may adversely affect our business. For example, if the Canal+
Assets are sold to another party, that new owner could elect not to distribute Canal+'s premium channels to Telenet
subscribers but instead distribute those channels to the subscribers of our competitors. Alternatively, the new owner
could offer those channels to us at higher prices than we currently pay. In addition, if we do not acquire Canal+, we
may not be able to offer digital television, as we would fail to regain and more efficiently allocate the nine channels of
our network currently used by the Canal+ group, acquire certain digital equipment and gain access to Canal+
employees with digital expertise. Also, our pending dispute with Canal+ regarding the termination of our contractual
arrangements would be less likely to be favorably resolved if the acquisition is not completed. See "Business—Legal
Proceedings—Canal+ Litigation."

If the Canal+ Acquisition is successful, the renewal of Canal+'s programming contracts on favorable terms
cannot be assured. Canal+ provides premium and pay-per-view programming to our subscribers but does not produce
or own its own content, and we do not otherwise offer any such programming. A major factor in Canal+'s ability to
attract and retain subscribers is its movie, sports and other programming, including the televising of the Belgian soccer
premier league. Our inability to obtain enough attractively priced competitive programming to meet our needs, owing to
the inability of Canal+ to renew programming contracts or otherwise, could reduce demand for our television services
and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, some of the programming contracts require Canal+, and would
require us upon completion of the Canal+ Acquisition, to pay prices for the programming based on a guaranteed
minimum number of subscribers, notwithstanding a lower number of actual subscribers. Therefore, if Canal+ or we
misjudge anticipated demand for the programming, the profitability of our service may be impaired.

**Risks Relating to Our Management and Principal Shareholders**

**_Our controlling shareholder, Cable Partners, is likely to undergo a restructuring, which may result in a change_**
**_of ownership in the near future that could give a third party a significant degree of control over Telenet._**

Pursuant to the shareholders' agreement among our shareholders, Cable Partners Europe, LLC ("Cable
Partners") has the indirect right to appoint half the members of our board of principal directors and the board of
directors of each of our subsidiaries. One of the directors appointed by Cable Partners is the chairman of each board
of directors and has the casting vote on all matters. Consequently, Cable Partners has control at our board of directors
and the boards of directors of our subsidiaries, subject to certain supermajority voting requirements. Cable Partners'
right to appoint half of the board of directors will end on December 31, 2004 or earlier if any of the following events
occur:

      - the consortium led by Cable Partners (the "Cable Partners Consortium") (which includes Cable
Partners, Evercore and CDPQ) ceases to own at least 17.2% of our shares; or

      - a change of control of Cable Partners occurs and a majority of our shareholders decide to terminate
Cable Partners' control of our board of directors.

A change of control of Cable Partners under the shareholders' agreement can arise if:

      - Richard J. Callahan and Andrew J. Sukawaty both cease to be actively engaged in the management
and leadership of Cable Partners;

      - Cable Partners ceases to own and control 50.1% of the voting equity of Callahan Investco Belgium 1
S.à R.L. ("CAI Belgium"); or

      - a competitive investor obtains control over Cable Partners.

Cable Partners' investment in us is indirect. Cable Partners owns all of Callahan Associates Holding Belgium
LLC, which entity in turn owns approximately 66% of CAI Belgium and 82% of Callahan Investco Belgium 2 S.à R.L.
("Investco2"), both of which are direct investors in us and collectively own approximately 19% of our outstanding
shares. Cable Partners pledged all of the shares of Callahan Associates Holdings Belgium ("CAMB") and CAMB
pledged all the shares of CAI Belgium and Investco2 to Merrill Lynch as collateral for an approximately [€70] million
loan from Merrill Lynch Capital Corporation ("Merrill Lynch") that matures on February 9, 2004. An affiliate of Merrill
Lynch is one of the initial purchasers of the Notes offered hereby and the Senior Discount Notes. Merrill Lynch
recently sold the loan and related collateral, including the share pledges, to an affiliate of Liberty Media Corporation
("Liberty Media"). CAI Belgium has pledged certain of its shares in us to Motorola as collateral for an approximately
€15 million loan to CAI Belgium that matures on February 9, 2004.

Cable Partners is actively attempting to restructure its debt and equity interests. The restructuring may be
effected as soon as January 2004 and would likely involve Liberty Media and/or another third party acquiring a
significant equity interest in CAMB, CAI Belgium and Investco2 or Cable Partners. It is currently anticipated that
under the restructuring Mr. Callahan and Mr. Sukawaty would remain involved in the management and leadership of
Cable Partners, and that CAI Belgium would retain its governance rights with respect to our group (which expire on
December 31, 2004, at the latest). We have also received expressions of interest in acquiring a direct stake in our
group, although we are not considering any such transactions currently.

Liberty Media will have the right to exercise the share pledge over CAMB and CAI Belgium and Investco2
beginning on February 9, 2004. If the share pledges are exercised, a change of control would be triggered under the
shareholders' agreement and Cable Partners could lose its governance rights over our group. Alternatively, Liberty
Media or any other entity could acquire control of Cable Partners and, depending on the terms of the acquisition, retain
Cable Partners' governance rights with respect to our group. Motorola, a significant supplier to our group, may enforce
its share pledge beginning on February 9, 2004, although the other investors in CAI Belgium have the right to repay this
loan and retain ownership of the pledged Telenet shares.

The interests of Cable Partners, Liberty Media or any other third party who may become a party to the

33


-----

restructuring of Cable Partners may conflict with your interests. Whoever is controlling us might cause us to pursue
business combinations, acquisitions, divestitures, financings and other transactions that could enhance the value of their
equity investment, even though those transactions might involve risks to you as holders of the Notes. Certain decisions
of our board of directors, including with respect to business combinations, acquisitions, debt financings and affiliate
transactions, are subject to supermajority voting requirements, which means that some of our directors other than those
appointed by Cable Partners must also vote in favor of such decisions. A restructuring of Cable Partners and related
changes to our board of directors would not trigger the change of control repurchase obligation under the indenture
governing the Notes. Likewise, a change of control under the shareholders' agreement would not necessarily constitute
a change of control under the indenture.

See "Management and Governance—Shareholders' Agreement—Composition of the Boards of Directors—
Governance Period," "Description of the Notes—Change of Control" and "Plan of Distribution."

**_We may have conflicts of interest with our principal shareholders, which could adversely affect our business_**
**_and your investment in the Notes._**

The principal shareholders of Telenet Group Holding, our parent company, are: the MICs, the Cable Partners
Consortium, GIMV NV, a consortium of regional financial institutions (the "Financial Consortium"), the PICs/Interkabel
CVBA and Electrabel, which own 33.3%, 21.6%, 15.1%, 15.1%, 9.3% and 4.9% of our shares, respectively. See
"Principal Shareholders."

The Cable Partners Consortium will exercise significant control over the Board of Directors of all of the
companies in our group until December 31, 2004, unless the Cable Partners Consortium ceases to own at least 17.2%
in our parent company or certain other changes of control occur. Cable Partners has in the past acquired, and may in
the future acquire, other cable television, Internet, data and telephony businesses, which may reduce the attention that
directors appointed by Cable Partners can devote to our business and the level of management resources that Cable
Partners can provide us. See "Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."

We may also have conflicts of interest if we engage in commercial transactions with other entities controlled
by any of our principal shareholders or if there are business opportunities that both we and another entity controlled by
a principal shareholder would like to pursue. Transactions that we enter into with these entities may not be the result of
arm's length negotiations. Consequently, such agreements may be less favorable than agreements we otherwise would
have entered into with unaffiliated third parties. In addition, our shareholders' agreement requires us to grant
preferential treatment to shareholders who are party to the agreement when we contract out certain services provided
that all agreements between us and the shareholder are concluded on an arm's-length basis and equivalent in all
material respects to the best offers received from third parties. We currently have management and technical service
contracts with Cable Partners, Electrabel, Interkabel and the PICs or their affiliates. See "Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions." Although we have implemented policies to prevent conflicts of interest from arising with our
principal shareholders, we cannot guarantee that conflicts will not in some instances arise. If they do, your investment
in the Notes may be adversely affected.

In addition, the principal shareholders of Telenet Group Holding have entered a shareholders' agreement that,
among other things, imposes supermajority voting requirements for certain decisions of the boards of directors,
including decisions to make certain acquisitions, approve (or make certain deviations from) our group's annual budget
and to appoint or remove our chief executive officer. These voting requirements may allow directors appointed by
minority shareholders to in effect block votes on certain matters that could impair our group's ability to operate. See
"Management and Governance—Shareholders' Agreement—Votes of the Boards of Directors."

**_The loss of any of our key executives could adversely affect our ability to manage our business._**

Our success is substantially dependent upon the retention and the continued performance of our key
executives, including Duco Sickinghe, our Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director; Leo Steenbergen, our Chief
Financial Officer; Paul Van Cotthem, our Senior Vice President—Residential Markets; and Jan Vorstermans, our
Senior Vice President—Technology, Engineering and Network Operations. The loss of the services of any of our key
executives could adversely affect our growth, financial condition and results of operations.

**Risks Related to Regulatory and Legislative Matters**

34


-----

**_We are subject to significant government regulation, which could require us to make additional expenditures or_**
**_limit our revenues._**

Our activities as a cable television and telephony operator in Flanders are subject to extensive regulation and
supervision by various regulatory bodies, including local, Flemish and national authorities and the European Union.
These regulations may increase our administrative and operational expenses and limit our revenues. Our Internet and
data businesses are not currently subject to extensive regulation, but could be in the future. You should review the
information contained in "Regulation" carefully before deciding to invest in the Notes.

We are subject to, among other things:

      - price regulation for certain services that we provide;

      - rules governing the interconnection between different telephone networks and the interconnection
rates that we can charge and that we pay;

      - marketing restrictions that limit how we can sell, among other things, combined Internet and telephony
products;

      - requirements that, under specified circumstances, a cable system carry certain broadcast stations or
obtain consent to carry a broadcast station;

      - rules for license renewals and transfers;

      - rules and regulations relating to subscriber privacy;

      - taxes imposed on our public rights of way; and

      - other requirements covering a variety of operational areas such as land use and environmental
protection, equal employment opportunity, technical standards and subscriber service requirements.

Changes in applicable law, regulations or government policy (or in the interpretation of existing laws or
regulations) could greatly influence our viability and how we operate our business and introduce new products and
services. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by any changes in relevant laws or regulations (or in
their interpretation) regarding, for example, licensing requirements, access and price regulation, interconnection
arrangements or the imposition of universal service obligations, or any change in policy allowing more favorable
conditions for other operators. Our ability to introduce new products and services may also be affected if we cannot
predict how existing or future laws, regulations or policies would apply to such product or service.

**_Pending legislation may significantly alter the regulatory regime applicable to us, which could adversely affect_**
**_our competitive position and profitability._**

The Belgian government is currently considering significant changes to the current regulatory regime applicable
to the provision of telephony, Internet and broadcasting services in order to implement the European Union's new
Community Electronic Communications Regulatory Framework and the related Universal Service Directive, the
Access Directive, the Authorization Directive and the Data Protection Directive (collectively, the "New Framework").
As explained in "Regulation—The New Framework," the New Framework is expected to replace our current
telephony and broadcasting licenses with general authorizations and could impose pricing and service restrictions on
entities deemed to have "significant market power" in any market in which they operate. See "—We may become
subject to more extensive regulation if we are deemed to possess significant market power in any of the markets in
which we operate." Although provisions of the New Framework will reduce the number of conditions with which we
must currently comply under our licenses, other aspects of the New Framework may adversely affect us. See
"Regulation—The New Framework." In addition, other provisions of relevant laws and regulations may be reviewed as
the New Framework is implemented. Legislators could decide, for example, to allow local municipalities to tax the
rights of way over which the Combined Network runs, as the municipalities have requested before. Such a tax liability
could be substantial. These potential changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of

35


-----

operations and financial condition.

**_We may become subject to more extensive regulation if we are deemed to possess significant market power in_**
**_any of the markets in which we operate._**

The New Framework imposes pricing and service restrictions on entities deemed to have significant market
power in any of the markets in which they operate. The European Commission has identified "wholesale broadband
access" and "broadcasting transmission services to deliver broadcast content to end-users" as candidate markets.
There is a risk that we could be found to have significant market power in these markets if Belgian authorities identify
these areas as relevant markets in which there is not sufficient competition. Such a determination could require us to
provide other service providers access to our network for purposes of providing competing broadband and broadcasting
services at regulated prices, and impose other restrictions on how we operate the Combined Network and market our
services. Granting such access would limit the bandwidth available for us to provide other products and services to the
customers served by the Combined Network. Such regulation could:

      - impair our ability to use our bandwidth in ways that would generate maximum revenue;

      - create a shortage of capacity on the Combined Network, which could limit the types and variety of
services we seek to provide our customers;

      - strengthen our competitors by granting them access and lowering their costs to enter into our markets;
and

      - have a significant adverse impact on our profitability.

The European Commission has also identified the termination of calls from one telephony network to end users
on another network as a market that may be regulated by the Belgian authorities. Under this defined market, whether a
network operator would have significant market power in terminating calls on its own network depends, among other
things, on the relative market position of the operator and the other operators seeking to interconnect to its network. If
an operator is found to have significant power in this market, it can be required to charge interconnection termination
rates that reflect its cost of providing the service. If we are found to have significant market power we may be
required to reduce our interconnection termination rates.

**_We do not have complete control over the prices that we charge or the programming that we provide, which_**
**_exposes us to third-party risks and may adversely affect our business and results of operations._**

The Belgian Ministry for Economic Affairs and the regional program council must consent to any increase in
the prices that we charge our subscribers for providing cable television. At the beginning of 2003, we received
permission from these entities to increase our subscription fees by an average of approximately 25% (an average of
approximately 15% in January 2003 and an additional 10% of the original price in July 2003). Prior to this increase,
subscription prices for our overall cable television subscriber base had not changed since 1994. We may not receive
approval for additional cable television subscription price increases in the future, which may have an adverse impact on
our revenues, profitability of new products and services and ability to respond to market changes.

We are also required to carry certain broadcast and other channels on our cable system that we would not
necessarily carry voluntarily. These "must carry" obligations currently apply to 15 of the television channels that we
deliver to any specific end user. We must carry the channels from the regional public broadcasters for no fee and also
do not charge a carriage fee to the other public broadcasters, but can charge commercial rates to other channels we
are required to carry. The New Framework will permit these "must carry" obligations to remain in effect, and will allow
Belgian authorities to set "appropriate remuneration" to cover the costs we incur as a result of being required to carry
these channels. We cannot guarantee that the remuneration that we receive for providing these required channels will
cover our actual costs of broadcasting these channels, or provide the return that we would otherwise receive if we
were allowed to freely choose the programming we offer on our system. Under the "must carry" regulations currently
in force, broadcasters can apply for "must carry" status, and it is possible that we may be required to carry additional
channels in the future. Increasing the number of channels that we must carry on our network would use valuable
network capacity that we could otherwise use to deliver alternative channels or services that may be profitable.

**Litigation Risks**

**_We face various litigation risks that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations._**

You should review "Business—Legal Proceedings" for a summary of some significant litigation and
investigations that you should carefully consider before making a decision to invest in the Notes.

**_We are currently involved in a significant dispute with Belgacom relating to the price we charge competitors to_**
**_interconnect to our telephony network, and an unfavorable outcome for us in this dispute would reduce_**
**_the profitability of our telephony business._**

In a series of rulings in June and August of 2002, the regulator of the Belgian telephony industry, the Belgian
Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications (Belgisch Instituut voor Postdiensten en Telecommunicatie)
(the "BIPT"), approved, over the protest of Belgacom, our request to increase the rates we charge other telephone
operators to terminate domestic calls on the Combined Network. We then raised our interconnection termination rates
and Belgacom appealed the BIPT's decision to the Council of State (Raad van State), the highest administrative court
in Belgium. Separately, Belgacom has challenged the new rates before the commercial court (Rechtbank van
_Koophandel) of Mechelen, alleging that the new rates constitute abusive pricing. Although the case before the Council_
of State may not be decided for several years, we have been informed that the commercial court may issue a decision
before the end of 2003, and we cannot ensure that the court will uphold our rate increases. An adverse decision from
the commercial court may force us to reduce the interconnection rates we charge and could prevent us from raising
our interconnection rates above their pre-August 2002 level altogether. If we cannot continue to charge our current
interconnection rates, our revenues would decline, and our telephony operations could experience a significant decline
in profitability. If the commercial or administrative courts were to require us to charge the original average
interconnection termination rate of [€0.009 per minute, we estimate that our annual revenues from interconnection]
would be reduced by approximately [€20 million. In addition, if we are required to reduce our interconnection rates, we]
may be required to refund the excess amounts that we have collected since August 2002. See "Business—Legal
Proceedings—Interconnection Litigation."

**_Failure to settle existing copyright claims of certain broadcasters and copyright collection agencies may have a_**
**_material adverse effect on our cash flow and financial condition._**

We, together with the other cable television operators in Belgium, have been engaged in extended litigation
with copyright collection agencies and broadcasters regarding the fees we pay to transmit content over our cable
networks. We have entered into settlement agreements with several of the copyright agencies and broadcasters
pursuant to which we have had to pay additional amounts for the period from 1996-2002 and pursuant to which we will
have to pay increased fees going forward. We have not yet entered into settlement agreements with several of the
other copyright agencies and broadcasters.

The foreign public broadcasters have obtained a judgment of approximately [€47.7] million against us and the
other Belgian cable operators for additional copyright fees owed for the period from 1996-2001. The Belgian cable
operators have appealed the judgment. We are jointly and severally liable for the full amount of the foreign public
broadcasters judgment, which means that we may be liable for approximately [€47.7] million if the other cable television
operators do not pay their proportional share of the damages. Interest on outstanding amounts owed under the
judgment will be payable from June 1, 2002 at the legal interest rate which is currently 7%. In addition to the litigation
with the foreign public broadcasters, we together with the other Belgian cable companies are involved in ongoing
litigation with other broadcasters and copyright collection agencies. We have set aside total provisions for copyright
litigation in the amount of [€43.3] million as of September 30, 2003. This amount includes [€25.4] million for our share of
the [€47.7] million judgment relating to the foreign public broadcasters (and [€22.2] million for other broadcasters and
copyright collection agencies).

In order to meet the increased copyright fees that we will have to bear, we increased the copyright fees we
charge our cable television subscribers in August 2003 from an average of [€1.08 per month to an average of €1.81 per]
month. As part of the group of Belgian cable television operators, we plan to negotiate settlement agreements with the
remaining copyright agencies and broadcasters. We cannot assure you, however, that we will be able to settle the
outstanding case with the foreign public broadcasters and the other remaining parties, or that we will be able to spread
the cost of the foreign public broadcasters judgment over future periods. A failure to achieve these objectives could

have a substantial negative effect on our cash flows and results of operations. See "Business—Legal Proceedings—
Copyright Litigation."

**Risks Relating to the Issuer and the Intercompany Loans**

**_The Issuer conducts no business operations of its own and will depend on payments from its subsidiaries to_**
**_make payments on the Notes; the Issuer's subsidiaries will be subject to restrictions on making any such_**
**_payments._**

The Issuer's assets consist of shares in and loans to Telenet Bidco issued under the Bidco Proceeds Loan, the
Existing Intercompany Loan and other intercompany loans. The Issuer conducts no business operations of its own and
will have to rely on payments under these loans and dividends and other distributions from Telenet Bidco to pay the
principal and interest due on the Notes. In addition, Telenet Bidco's assets consist of shares in and loans to its
subsidiaries. Telenet Bidco conducts no business operations of its own and will have to rely on payments under these
loans, including the Operaties Proceeds Loan, other loans, dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries, to
make payments on the Bidco Proceeds Loan and the Existing Intercompany Loan and to pay dividends and
distributions to the Issuer. Telenet Operaties will rely in part on payments under the MixtICS Proceeds Loan and
dividends and other distributions from MixtICS to make payments on the Operaties Proceeds Loan and to pay
dividends and other distributions to Telenet Bidco. The Proceeds Loans and other intercompany loans among the Issuer
and its subsidiaries are subordinated to the obligations of our subsidiaries to the lenders under the senior credit facility
and may in the future be subordinated to other indebtedness of our subsidiaries. The terms of the senior credit facility
and the Intercreditor Agreement and applicable law also restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments and
other distributions to the Issuer. Except for limited payments by Telenet Bidco under the Bidco Proceeds Loan and the
Existing Intercompany Loan and for the Subsidiary Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors, the Issuer's subsidiaries
have no obligation to make payments to the Issuer to enable it to satisfy its obligations under the Notes or to make
funds available for these payments, whether in the form of loans, dividends or otherwise. The Issuer is therefore
subject to all risks to which our group is subject, to the extent such risks may affect the ability of its subsidiaries to
make distributions to the Issuer.

If the subsidiaries of the Issuer are unable to distribute sufficient funds to it, the Issuer may not be able to
make the required payments under the Notes when they become due. A default under the Notes would cause certain
of our subsidiaries to be in default under the senior credit facility, which could materially adversely affect our growth,
our financial condition and results of operations and result in our not having sufficient assets to make payments on the
Notes. See "Description of Other Indebtedness."

Telenet Group Holding, the parent of the Issuer, has guaranteed the Notes on a senior basis although it is not
subject to the covenants applicable to the Notes. Telenet Group Holding is a holding company and subject to risks
similar to those identified above for the Issuer, which may affect the ability of Telenet Group Holding to make any
payments that may become due and payable under its guarantee of the Notes.

**_The lenders under the Proceeds Loans may not be able to recover any amounts under the Proceeds Loans_**
**_because of limitations on the lender's ability to receive payments thereunder._**

The ability of the Issuer to take enforcement action against Telenet Bidco under the Bidco Proceeds Loan or
the Existing Intercompany Loan is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement. In
addition, in order to facilitate the consummation of an enforcement sale with respect to Telenet Bidco's shares by the
security agent for the senior credit facility, all the Issuer's right, title and interest in the Bidco Proceeds Loan and the
Existing Intercompany Loan, all of Telenet Bidco's right, title and interest in the Operaties Proceeds Loan and all of
Telenet Operaties' right, title and interest in the MixtICS Proceeds Loan, have been pledged to the security agent on a
first priority basis as security for the repayment in full of the senior credit facility. As a result of the foregoing:

      - in the event of a liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or similar proceeding
involving Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties or MixtICS, (i) the lenders under the senior credit facility
will be entitled to payment in full of all amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility before the
Issuer would be entitled to payments under the Bidco Proceeds Loan or the Existing Intercompany
Loan and, as a result, before you would ultimately receive any payments on the Notes, and (ii) the
Issuer will be required to turnover any amounts it receives under the Bidco Proceeds Loan or the

38


-----

Existing Intercompany Loan, in each case, to the security agent for the senior credit facility until all
amounts outstanding under the senior credit facility are paid in full;

      - Telenet Bidco may not make payments in respect of the Bidco Proceeds Loans or the Existing
Intercompany Loan in the event that any payment has not been made when due in respect of the
senior credit facility, and this prohibition will continue until there is no outstanding payment default
under the senior credit facility;

      - the lenders under the senior credit facility may prevent Telenet Bidco from making payments to the
Issuer (including in respect of the Bidco Proceeds Loan and the Existing Intercompany Loan) for a
period of up to 179 days in the event that there exists any event of default under the senior credit
facility;

      - the Bidco Proceeds Loan and the Existing Intercompany Loan are subject to a 179-day standstill
period on enforcement actions that could otherwise be taken if there is an event of default under the
Notes;

      - in the event that the lenders under the senior credit facility enforce their first priority pledge of
receivables arising under the Bidco Proceeds Loan and the Existing Intercompany Loan, the Issuer's
rights under the Bidco Proceeds Loan and the Existing Intercompany Loan may be assigned to a third
party, and the Issuer would have no right, title or interest thereunder;

      - in the event that the lenders under the senior credit facility enforce their first priority security interest
with respect to the Operaties Proceeds Loan, Telenet Bidco's rights under the Operaties Proceeds
Loan may be assigned to a third party, and Telenet Bidco would have no right, title or interest
thereunder; and

      - in the event that the lenders under the senior credit facility enforce their first priority security interest
with respect to the MixtICS Proceeds Loan, Telenet Operaties' rights under the MixtICS Proceeds
Loan may be assigned to a third party, and Telenet Operaties would have no right, title or interest
thereunder.

**Risks Related to the Subsidiary Guarantees, Pledges and Belgian Law**

**_Your right to receive payment under the Subsidiary Guarantees will be junior in right of payment to other_**
**_obligations of the Subsidiary Guarantors._**

Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties, Telenet Holding and Telenet Vlaanderen will guarantee the Notes, jointly
and severally, on a senior subordinated basis. Accordingly, to the extent that the Subsidiary Guarantees are
enforceable, you would have a direct senior subordinated claim based on Subsidiary Guarantees against the Subsidiary
Guarantors. However, the Subsidiary Guarantees are subject to subordination provisions similar to those described
above with respect to the Bidco Proceeds Loan and the Existing Intercompany Loan and each subsidiary's guarantee
will be junior in right of payment to the guarantee that subsidiary has given to the lenders under the senior credit facility
and guarantees of other senior indebtedness of that subsidiary. As of September 30, 2003, after giving effect to the
Refinancing, the Subsidiary Guarantors would have had approximately [€ 840] million of indebtedness outstanding under
the senior credit facility that was senior in right of payment to the Subsidiary Guarantees (we estimate that
approximately [€701] million of indebtedness would have been guaranteed by MixtICS on a basis that is senior in right of
payment to MixtICS's guarantee of the Operaties Proceeds Loan). As a result, you will not be able to collect under the
Subsidiary Guarantees from the Subsidiary Guarantors until the guaranteed claims of the lenders under the senior credit
facility and other senior indebtedness of that subsidiary have been satisfied in full. The subsidiaries granting these
Subsidiary Guarantees may not have sufficient funds remaining to pay all amounts owing under the Subsidiary
Guarantees after satisfying these more senior claims.

**_The Subsidiary Guarantees are subject to a standstill on enforcement and may be released in certain_**
**_circumstances._**

The Subsidiary Guarantees are subject to a 179-day standstill period in favor of the lenders under the senior

39


-----

credit facility, which may disadvantage you in the event that we are in financial difficulties and it would be
advantageous to you to enforce the Subsidiary Guarantees immediately. The Subsidiary Guarantees may also be
released in the event that the lenders under the senior credit facility enforce their security and sell one or more of our
subsidiaries who granted a Subsidiary Guarantee or its parent, or in the event of certain disposals by our group. See
"Description of the Notes—Subsidiary Guarantees." If this were to happen, you would not be entitled to enforce any
Subsidiary Guarantee that had been released.

**_The guarantees of the Notes and the pledges may each be limited by applicable law or subject to certain_**
**_limitations or defenses that limit the right to receive payment under the guarantees or to take_**
**_enforcement action under the pledges._**

The guarantees of the Notes by Telenet Group Holding and the Subsidiary Guarantors provide the holders of
the Notes with a direct claim against the assets of the guarantors. Each of the guarantees, however, will be limited to
the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular guarantor without rendering the guarantee, as it relates to
that guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law. In addition, enforcement of any of these
guarantees against any guarantor would be subject to certain defenses available to guarantors generally. These laws
and defenses include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial assistance,
corporate purpose or benefit and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If these laws and
defenses are applicable, a guarantor may have no liability under its guarantee.

In particular, Belgian case law requires that a guarantee by a Belgian company of third-party obligations satisfy
the following conditions: (i) it must be part of the corporate purposes of the guarantor, as provided for in its by-laws
(statuten); (ii) the guarantor must derive an actual corporate benefit, consideration or advantage from the transaction
secured by the guarantee, taken as a whole; and (iii) the guarantee must not be in an amount which is not
commensurate with the financial capabilities of the company or its assets. The presence of an actual corporate benefit
to a Belgian guarantor is a matter of fact and Belgian case law provides no clear definition of what constitutes an
actual corporate benefit. The boards of directors of each of Telenet Group Holding and the Subsidiary Guarantors have
resolved that the issuance of the Notes and its guarantee of the Notes confers an actual corporate benefit on
themselves pursuant to the terms of their respective guarantees of the Notes. However, due to the absence of case
law, we cannot assure you that a court in Belgium would agree with this determination. If a court in Belgium
determined that actual corporate benefit is not established as to a guarantor, then the guarantee given by that guarantor
could be declared void upon request of the guarantor (or its bankruptcy trustee). In addition, enforcement in Belgium of
the guarantees is subject to authorization by the Belgian courts.

It is possible that a guarantor, a creditor of a guarantor or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of
a guarantor, may contest the validity and enforceability of the guarantor's guarantee and that the applicable court may
determine that the guarantee should be voided or declared unenforceable. For a description of the enforceability of
obligations, including guarantees, in bankruptcy and judicial composition proceedings, see "—Belgian insolvency laws
may adversely affect a recovery by the holders of the Notes."

The share charges and pledges of receivables are subject to similar limitations and defenses.

**_MixtICS has not directly guaranteed the Notes and the ability to recover on its guarantee of the Operaties_**
**_Proceeds Loans is subject to significant limitations._**

MixtICS, our cable television operating subsidiary, has not directly guaranteed the Notes, although MixtICS has
guaranteed the obligations of Telenet Operaties under the Operaties Proceeds Loan and receivables arising under the
MixtICS Proceeds Loan and the entire share capital of MixtICS have been pledged to secure the Notes. Accordingly,
holders of the Notes will not have a direct contractual claim against MixtICS and the MixtICS Guarantee will be limited
to the amount of the Operaties Proceeds Loan, which will be approximately [€275] million. In addition, MixtICS's
guarantee of the Operaties Proceeds Loan is subject to similar limitations on enforcement actions upon an event of
default under the Notes as the Subsidiary Guarantees as well as similar subordination provisions.

The guarantee of MixtICS of the obligations of Telenet Operaties also will be subject to similar legal limitations
as the guarantees of the Notes.

**_Your ability to recover under the share pledges and pledges of receivables under the Proceeds Loans is limited._**

40


-----

Under the share pledges, all the shares of Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties and MixtICS are pledged on a
second priority basis to the Junior Security Agent for the Notes as joint creditor together with Holders to secure
obligations under the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees and the indenture governing the Notes. Receivables arising
under the Proceeds Loans will also be pledged on a second priority basis to the Junior Security Agent to secure the
same obligations. The shares of each of these companies and all these receivables are pledged to secure obligations
under the senior credit facility on a first priority basis. The priority of the share pledges is a function of their recording
in the shareholders' register of the relevant company, and the priority of the receivables pledges is a function of when
notice of the pledge is delivered to the debtor under the pledged receivable. These priorities are also contractually
provided for in the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, some claims (voorrechten) may rank by operation of law
before any other claim that may be secured by the share pledges and pledges of receivables. These claims include,
among others, court costs (gerechtskosten) and costs incurred for the preservation of the pledged assets.

You may not be able to recover on the share pledges or the pledges of receivables under the Proceeds Loans
because the lenders under the senior credit facility will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any
enforcement of these pledges and an enforcement sale with respect to the shares of any of Telenet Bidco, Telenet
Operaties and MixtICS, which would be subject to compliance with certain provisions contained in the Intercreditor
Agreement relating to procedures to be followed in connection with enforcement sales. If the proceeds realized from
such sales of collateral exceed the amount owed under the senior credit facility, any excess amount of such proceeds
will be paid to the Junior Security Agent for its own benefit and for benefit of owners of the Notes and other creditors
permitted by the indenture governing the Notes to share in the collateral on an equal and ratable basis with the Notes.
If there are no excess proceeds from sales of collateral, or if the amount of such excess proceeds is less than the
aggregate amount of the obligations under the Notes and other obligations that share in the collateral on an equal and
ratable basis with the Notes, you will not recover some or all of the amounts owed to you under the Notes. The
Subsidiary Guarantees will be automatically released at the time of an enforcement sale with respect to Telenet Bidco
shares, so the Trustee and the holders of the Notes will have no claims under the Subsidiary Guarantees following an
enforcement sale. In addition, the Subsidiary Guarantee of Telenet Operaties and the guarantee of the Operaties
Proceeds Loan by MixtICS will be automatically released at the time of an enforcement sale with respect to the shares
of Telenet Operaties, and MixtICS will be automatically released from its guarantee of the Operaties Proceeds Loan at
the time of an enforcement sale with respect to the shares of MixtICS. The ability of the holders of the Notes to
require the security agent to take enforcement action under the share pledges or the pledges of receivables under the
Proceeds Loans is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement. The Intercreditor
Agreement provides for a 179-day standstill period on enforcement of the share pledges and the pledges of receivables
under the Proceeds Loans after an event of default under the Notes.

**_The share pledges and pledges of receivables will not be granted directly to the holders of Notes._**

The share pledges and pledges of receivables that will constitute security for obligations of the Issuer and the
guarantors of the Notes, under the Notes and the indenture governing the Notes, will not be granted directly to the
holders of the Notes but will be granted only in favor of the Junior Security Agent for the Notes, acting as joint creditor
together with the holders of the Notes, of all such obligations. As a consequence, holders of the Notes will not have
direct security and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the security for the Notes and the
guarantees of the Notes, except through the Junior Security Agent for the Notes, which has agreed to apply any
proceeds of enforcement on such security towards such obligations. The Junior Security Agent for the Notes will agree
with the Trustee for the Notes that the Junior Security Agent will hold the security and any proceeds of the security in
trust for the benefit of holders of the Notes and the trustee under the Notes. However, as the Junior Security Agent
has, as joint creditor together with the holders of the Notes, a claim against the Issuer and the guarantors of the Notes
for the full principal amount of the Notes, holders of the Notes bear some risks associated with a possible insolvency or
bankruptcy of the Junior Security Agent. The indenture governing the Notes will provide that the Junior Security Agent
will be replaced if it ceases to be rated at least "A" by Standard & Poor's Ratings Service or Moody's Investors
Service Inc (or an equivalent rating). The Junior Security Agent for the Notes will agree that it will only proceed
against the security with the approval of the trustee for the Notes and for the purpose of recovery against the pledged
shares and receivables. Nonetheless, there can be no assurance that, in the event of an insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Junior Security Agent, a trustee in bankruptcy, receiver or similar entity would not assert rights as a joint creditor for
the full amount of the Notes.

**_Belgian fraudulent conveyance law may adversely affect the enforceability of the Notes, the guarantees of the_**

41


-----

**_Notes, the MixtICS Guarantee, the share pledges and pledges of receivables under the Proceeds Loans._**

The issuance of the Notes, the guarantees of the Notes, the guarantee by MixtICS of the Operaties Proceeds
Loan, the pledges of the shares of Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties and MixtICS and the pledge of receivables arising
under the Proceeds Loans may be subject to review under the Belgian fraudulent conveyance law (actio pauliana)
enacted for the protection of creditors. Under the Belgian fraudulent conveyance law, a creditor could bring a claim
and a court could declare the Notes or any of the guarantees or pledges ineffective (niet-tegenstelbaar) with respect
to the creditor bringing the claim if the following conditions are met:

      - the creditor's claim arose before the challenged transaction, commitment or agreement;

      - the challenged transaction, commitment or agreement has caused a financial prejudice to the creditor
or has a material adverse effect on the possibility that the creditor will recover its claim;

      - the debtor entered into the transaction, commitment or agreement knowing that it would financially
prejudice the creditor; and

      - the party entering the challenged transaction, commitment or agreement with the debtor, knew or
should have known, that the transaction was abnormal, causing a financial prejudice to other creditors
of the debtor. In the case of gratuitous acts (such as, arguably, providing a guarantee or other security
for third-party obligations), it has been held that this knowledge test does not apply.

When successful, the plaintiff-creditor will receive a court ruling holding that the challenged transaction,
commitment or agreement is ineffective with respect to such plaintiff-creditor, the debtor and the beneficiary of the
challenged transaction, commitment or agreement.

In insolvency proceedings, Belgian bankruptcy law has specific provisions relating to fraudulent conveyance
and voidable preferences. See "—Belgian insolvency laws may adversely affect a recovery by the holders of the
Notes."

If a court were to find that the issuance of the Notes, a guarantee of the Notes, the guarantee by MixtICS of
the Operaties Proceeds Loan, a pledge of shares or a pledge of receivables was a fraudulent conveyance, the court
could hold that the payment obligations under the Notes, such guarantee or such pledge are ineffective, or require the
holders of the Notes to repay any amounts received with respect to the Notes or such guarantee. In the event of a
finding that a fraudulent conveyance occurred, you may not receive any repayment on the Notes or the guarantees of
the Notes.

**_Belgian insolvency laws may adversely affect a recovery by the holders of the Notes._**

The Issuer of the Notes, the guarantors of the Notes and MixtICS are incorporated, and have their principal
place of business, in Belgium and, consequently, may be subject to insolvency laws and proceedings in Belgium.

There are two types of insolvency procedures under Belgian law:

      - the judicial composition (gerechtelijk akkoord) procedure; and

      - the bankruptcy (faillissement) procedure.

_Judicial Composition_

A proceeding for a judicial composition may be commenced if either:

      - the debtor is temporarily unable to meet its payment obligations; or

      - if certain difficulties jeopardize the continuation of the debtor's business which could lead to cessation
of payments in the short run. The continuation of the debtor's business is in any event deemed to be
jeopardized if, as a result of losses, the debtor's net assets have declined to less than 50% of its stated

42


-----

capital.

A debtor is only eligible for judicial composition if its financial position can be restructured and if economic
recovery (i.e., a continuation of the business in the long-term) is possible. A request for a judicial composition can be
filed either on the initiative of the debtor (by a petition) or on the initiative of the public prosecutor. During an initial
request period, the debtor cannot be dissolved and cannot be adjudicated into bankruptcy. The court can consider a
preliminary suspension of payments during an initial period of six months, which can be extended by up to a maximum
period of three months at the request of the company. As a rule, creditors cannot enforce their rights against the
debtor's assets during the period of preliminary suspension of payments, except in the following circumstances:

      - failure by the debtor to pay interest or charges falling due in the course of the preliminary suspension
period; or

      - failure by the debtor to pay any new debts (i.e., debts which have arisen after the date of the judicial
composition).

Creditors have to file their claims within the period indicated in the judgment.

During the preliminary suspension period, the debtor must draw up an installment plan or a reorganization plan
which must be approved by a majority of its creditors (having filed their claims with the court), who were present at a
meeting of creditors and whose aggregate claims represent over half of all outstanding claims of the debtor. This plan
will be approved by the court provided it does not violate public policy and that the company's management offers
sufficient guarantees of integrity. The plan will be binding on all creditors listed in the plan. The court can then award a
final suspension of payments for a maximum period of 24 months as from the date of the judgment. This term can be
extended by up to a maximum of 12 months. Enforcement rights of creditors whose claims are secured by an _in rem_
right, such as a share pledge, are as a rule not bound by the plan. Such creditors may, as a result, enforce their security
from the beginning of the final suspension period. Under certain conditions, enforcement by such creditors can be
suspended for up to 18 months from the date that the court approves the plan.

Any provision providing that an agreement would be terminated as the result of a debtor entering a judicial
composition is ineffective.

_Bankruptcy_

A company which, on a sustained basis, ceases to make payments and whose credit is impaired, will be
deemed to be in a state of bankruptcy. Within one month after the cessation of payments, the company must file for
bankruptcy. If the company is late in filing for bankruptcy, its directors could be held liable for damages to creditors as
a result thereof. Bankruptcy procedures may also be initiated on the request of unpaid creditors or on the initiative of
the public prosecutor.

Once the court decides that the requirements for bankruptcy are met, the court will establish a date before
which claims for all unpaid debts must be filed by creditors. A bankruptcy trustee will be appointed to assume the
operation of the business and to organize a sale of the debtor's assets, the distribution of the proceeds thereof to
creditors and the liquidation of the debtor.

Payments or other transactions (as listed below) made by a company during a certain period of time prior to
that company being declared bankrupt (the "suspect period") (verdachte periode) can be voided for the benefit of the
creditors. The court will determine the date of commencement and the duration of the suspect period. This period
starts on the date of sustained cessation of payment of debts by the debtor. Usually, the court will establish this date in
a separate judgment after the bankruptcy judgment, but this date cannot be earlier than six months before the date of
the bankruptcy judgment, unless a decision to dissolve the company was made more than six months before the date of
the bankruptcy judgment, in which case the date could be the date of such decision to dissolve the company. Creditors
can start proceedings to determine the date of commencement of the suspect period within six months following the
bankruptcy judgment. The ruling determining the date of commencement of the suspect period or the bankruptcy
judgment itself can be opposed by third parties, such as other creditors, within 15 days following the publication of that
ruling in the Belgian Official Gazette.

43


-----

The rules on transactions which can or must be voided for the benefit of the bankrupt estate in the event of
bankruptcy are as follows:

      - Any transaction entered into by a Belgian company during the suspect period is ineffective if the value
given to such creditors significantly exceeded the value the company received in consideration.

      - Any transaction entered into by a company which has stopped making payments may be voided upon
the subsequent bankruptcy of such company if the counter party to the transaction was aware of the
suspension of payments.

      - Security interests granted during the suspect period must be declared ineffective if they intend to
secure a debt which existed prior to the date on which the security interest was granted.

      - Any payments (in whatever form, i.e. money or in kind or by way of set-off) made during the suspect
period of any debt which was not yet due as well as all payments made during the suspect period other
than with money or monetary instruments (checks, promissory notes, etc.) must be declared
ineffective.

      - Any transaction or payment effected with fraudulent intent will be set aside irrespective of its date.

Following a judgment commencing a bankruptcy proceeding, enforcement rights of individual creditors are
suspended. Creditors secured by _in rem rights, such as share pledges, will regain their ability to enforce their rights_
under the security after the bankruptcy trustee has verified the creditors claims.

**_It is possible that a court may apply voting and meeting provisions of Belgian law which are different than the_**
**_requirements in the indenture which may prejudice your interests._**

The terms of the indenture governing the Notes allow for amendments and modifications to certain terms of
the Notes without the approval of the holders of Notes and require the approval of each holder of Notes affected by an
amendment or modification for certain other terms. Under Belgian law, the minimum requirement for certain
amendments or modifications to the terms of "bonds" (within the meaning of Article 568 of the Belgian Company
Code) is the approval of holders of 75% in principal amount of the bonds held by holders present (in person or by
proxy) at a duly convened bondholders' meeting. In addition, the precise scope of Article 568 of the Belgian Company
Code, which specifies the amendments and modifications that are required to be approved at a bondholders' meeting, is
not entirely clear. Although we believe that the provisions of the indenture governing the Notes that relate to
amendments should apply, it is possible that a court might apply Belgian law and recognize amendments or
modifications to the terms of the Notes, including changes related to interest rates and the maturity date of the Notes,
adopted in accordance with Belgian law even if the terms of the indenture governing the Notes require approval by a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding or the consent of each affected holder of Notes.

**Risks Related to the Offering**

**_United States securities laws restrict the circumstances under which you can transfer the Notes._**

We are offering the Notes in reliance upon exemptions from registration under the Securities Act and
applicable state securities laws. Therefore, the Notes may be transferred or resold only in transactions registered
under, exempt from or not subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act and all applicable state
securities laws. You should read the discussions under "Transfer Restrictions" for further information about these and
other transfer restrictions. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of Notes comply with applicable
law.

**_We cannot assure you that an active trading market will develop for the Notes._**

Prior to the offering, there was no market for the Notes. Although we have applied for listing of the Notes on
the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, we cannot assure you that the Notes will be or will remain listed on that stock
exchange or that active trading markets will develop for the Notes. The initial purchasers have informed the Issuer that
they intend to make a market in the Notes after the offering is completed. The initial purchasers, however, may cease

44


-----

their market-making at any time without notice. The price at which the Notes may trade will depend on many factors,
including, but not limited to, prevailing interest rates, general economic conditions, our performance and financial results
and markets for similar securities. Historically, the markets for non-investment grade debt such as the Notes have been
subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in their prices. The market, if any, for the Notes may be
subject to similar disruptions which may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes.

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore you may have to rely on the procedures of the_**
**_relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until Definitive Registered Notes are issued in exchange for book-entry interests in the Notes,
owners of the book-entry interests may not in all cases be considered owners or holders of Notes. The person shown
in the records of the NBB or the direct or indirect participants in the clearing system operated by the NBB (the "X/N
System") as the holder of a particular principal amount at maturity of the Global Notes will for all purposes be treated
by the Issuer and any paying agent as the holder of such principal amount of Global Notes other than with respect to
the payment of principal, premium (if any), interest on such Global Notes, the right to which will be vested, as against
the Issuer and the Trustee, solely in the person shown in the records of NBB as the holder of such principal amount at
maturity of the Global Notes. Under Belgian law, holders of book-entry interests in the Global Notes through the X/N
System will have a co-ownership right in the Global Notes held in custody by the NBB. Holders of book-entry interests
with Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg will have a co-ownership right in the Notes credited to Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg participants in the X/N System.

Payments of principal, interest and other amounts owing on or in respect of the Notes in global form will be
made to a Belgian paying agent, which will make payments to direct participants in the X/N System, including
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Thereafter, payments will be made by Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg to their accountholders. None of the Issuer nor any of its affiliates or subsidiaries, or the Trustee, will
have any responsibility or liability for any aspect of the records relating to, or payments of interest, principal or other
amounts to, the X/N System or its participants, including Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, or to owners of
book-entry interests.

Depending upon who is deemed to be the holder of the Notes for the purposes of consents and waivers, which
may depend upon whether New York, Belgian or other law is applicable, and, in practice, upon who is able to obtain a
holder certificate in accordance with the provisions in the Indenture for meetings holders of Notes or is otherwise able
to obtain a certificate or certify that it is the holder of the Notes to the satisfaction of the Trustee, owners of book-entry
interests may not have the direct right to act upon solicitations of proxies for meetings of holders of Notes or, in certain
circumstances, for consents from or requests for waivers by holders of the Notes. Instead, they may be able to act
only to the extent their instructions are given effect by direct and indirect participants in the X/N System, including
Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. We cannot assure you that procedures implemented for giving effect to such
instructions will be sufficient to enable you to vote on any requested actions on a timely basis.

**_You may have difficulty enforcing your rights against us, our directors and certain members of our senior_**
**_management._**

The Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors, MixtICS and Telenet Group Holding are limited liability companies
organized under the laws of Belgium. Most of our directors and members of our senior management entrusted with the
day-to-day management of our group ("executive officers"), are non-residents of the United States and substantially all
our assets and the assets of our directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States. As a result, it
may not be possible for investors to effect service of process within the United States upon us and most of our
directors and executive officers, or to enforce against us or them judgments obtained in U.S. courts predicated upon
civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States.

Furthermore, we have been advised by our Belgian counsel that the United States is not currently bound by a
treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, in civil and
commercial matters with Belgium. Therefore, enforcement in Belgium of any judgment obtained in a New York court
based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon the U.S. Federal securities laws, will be subject to
certain conditions.

There is also doubt whether a Belgian court would have the requisite power or authority to grant remedies

sought in an original action brought in Belgium on the basis of violations of the U.S. securities laws. See "Service of
Process and Enforcement of Liabilities."

**_The Issuer may not be able to obtain enough funds to repurchase your Notes if a change of control takes place._**

Upon a change of control (as defined in the indenture governing the Notes), you may require the Issuer to
purchase all or part of the Notes then outstanding at 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest
and additional amounts, if any, as applicable, to the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, we cannot
assure you that we would have sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes, and we expect that
we would require third-party financing to do so. We cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain this financing
on favorable terms, if at all. In addition, the senior credit facility imposes restrictions on distributions from our
subsidiaries that will restrict our ability to repurchase the Notes, including pursuant to an offer in connection with a
change of control. A change of control may result in an event of default under the senior credit facility and may cause
the acceleration of other indebtedness which may be senior to, or rank equally with, the Notes. Our future indebtedness
may also contain restrictions on repayment requirements with respect to certain events or transactions that could
constitute a change of control under the indenture. The inability to repay senior indebtedness, if accelerated, and to
purchase the tendered Notes, would each constitute an event of default under the indenture. See "Description of Other
Indebtedness—Senior Credit Facility" and "Description of the Notes—Change of Control."

**EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and other currencies may affect our business. The
following chart shows for the period from January 1, 1999 through December 15, 2003, the period end, average, high
and low noon buying rates in The City of New York for cable transfers of euro as certified for customs purposes by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York expressed as U.S. dollars per [€1.00. The euro did not exist as a currency]
prior to January 1, 1999. The rates below may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the consolidated
financial statements and other financial information appearing in this offering memorandum. Our inclusion of these
exchange rates does not mean that the euro amounts actually represent such U.S. dollar amounts or that such amounts
could have been converted into U.S. dollars at any particular rate, if at all. The noon buying rate of the euro on
December 15, 2003 was U.S.$1.23 = [€1.00.]

The exchange rates between the euro and the U.S. dollar for 1998 is derived from the exchange rate between
the Belgian Franc and the U.S. dollar, based on the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of
Belgian Franc as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the applicable period,
translated into euro at the fixed conversion rate of BEF40.3399 = [€1.00.]

**OUR HISTORY**

In September 1996, Telenet Holding NV ("Telenet Holding") was incorporated to deliver telephony and, later,
Internet services to residential subscribers in Flanders. Its operating subsidiaries included Telenet Operaties NV
("Telenet Operaties") and Telenet Vlaanderen NV ("Telenet Vlaanderen"). Telenet Holding's original shareholders
were:

      - the mixed intercommunales ("MICs") in Flanders, which are utility companies that are owned by both
municipalities and Electrabel, the former operator of the MICs cable systems;

      - a consortium of regional financial institutions (the "Financial Consortium");

      - GIMV NV ("GIMV"), a publicly listed company, of which a majority is owned by the Flemish
government;

      - six (now five) pure intercommunales ("PICs") in Flanders, utility companies wholly owned by
municipalities that hold their interest through Interkabel Vlaanderen CVBA ("Interkabel"); and

      - US West International Holdings, Inc. (which was subsequently renamed MediaOne International
Holdings, Inc.).

In July 1997, Telenet Holding and its subsidiaries completed construction of their fiber backbone in Flanders. In
order for Telenet Holding to be able to deliver services to its subscribers, it needed access to the "local loop" coaxial
network of the MICs and PICs, which connect Telenet's fiber network to homes and businesses in Flanders. The
MICs granted Telenet Vlaanderen a co-ownership right in their local loops, which allowed Telenet to provide certain
point-to-point telecommunications, video and multimedia services to its subscribers. The PICs granted co-ownership
rights in their local loops to Interkabel and Interkabel in turn granted to us rights to use the PICs' local loops to provide
certain point-to-point telecommunications, video and multimedia services pursuant to a contribution deed dated
September 23, 1996 (the "Interkabel Contribution Deed"). These usage rights continue for a period of 50-years, of
which 43 years remain, and are automatically renewable for successive 15-year periods unless terminated with ten
years prior notice. See "Business—The Combined Network—Our Usage Rights on the PICs Network." In
January 1998, the Telenet Holding group began providing Internet and telephony services to the public.

The Telenet group found a new strategic partner in 2001 when Callahan Investco Belgium 1 S.à R.L. ("CAI
Belgium"), a subsidiary of Callahan Associates International LLC ("CAI"), led a consortium of investors (the "Cable
Partners Consortium") to acquire a controlling interest in the Telenet group. The Cable Partners Consortium acquired a
controlling interest in Telenet Holding through Telenet Bidco NV ("Telenet Bidco"), which acquired its interest in
Telenet Holding in exchange for a mixture of cash, equity and debt. CAI subsequently changed its name to Cable
Partners Europe, LLC.

**MixtICS Acquisition**

In August 2002, the Telenet group acquired the cable television business of the MICs (the "MixtICS
Acquisition"). Each of the ten MICs contributed their cable television businesses, including their network assets and
subscribers, to a newly created vehicle, Mixt NV (which subsequently changed its name to MixtICS NV ("MixtICS")).
Telenet Bidco acquired the shares of MixtICS in exchange for a mixture of cash, debt, certain deferred payment and
other subordinated shareholder obligations and newly issued shares and warrants of certain members of the Telenet
group. As part of the acquisition, Telenet Vlaanderen also assumed the obligation to pay the MICs certain deferred
costs related to the upgrade of the MICs network. See "—Network Upgrade." Two new entities were also involved in
the closing process, Telenet Group Holding NV ("Telenet Group Holding") (the current parent company of our group)
and Telenet Holdco NV (now known as Telenet Communications NV, the "Issuer"). Telenet Group Holding owns all
of the shares of the Issuer, which in turn owns all of the shares of Telenet Bidco.

As a result of the MixtICS Acquisition, the MICs' interest in our group increased significantly. After the
closing of the acquisition, the principal shareholders of Telenet Group Holding were as follows: the MICs, 33.3%;
Cable Partners Consortium, 21.6%; GIMV, 15.1%; the Financial Consortium, 15.1%; Interkabel, 9.3%; and Electrabel,
4.9%. The Cable Partners Consortium retained certain governance and control rights with respect to the Telenet

group.

We plan to use a portion of proceeds from this offering to repay certain of the deferred payment and other
subordinated shareholder obligations incurred in connection with the MixtICS Acquisition. The remaining subordinated
obligations will be repaid from the proceeds of the issuance of the Senior Discount Notes. See "Use of Proceeds" and
"Capitalization."

**Network Upgrade**

Our access agreements with the MICs and the PICs provided for an upgrade of their networks to a hybrid
fiber coaxial ("HFC") standard with bi-directional digital transmission capabilities. This upgrade was substantially
completed by June 2002. See "Business—The Combined Network—HFC Upgrade."

The PICs prefinanced the full amount required to upgrade their networks and the MICs prefinanced 40% of
the amount required to upgrade their networks. The payments made pursuant to clientele agreements dated
September 23, 1996 (the "Clientele Agreements"), were intended to enable the MICs and PICs to recover
approximately 40% of these upgrade costs in exchange for access to their cable network subscriber databases (which
represented all the amounts prefinanced by the MICs). Our obligations under our Clientele Agreement with the MICs
expired after the MixtICS Acquisition, but our obligations to make payments to the PICs continue to exist. As part of
the Interkabel Contribution Deed we agreed to pay an annuity fee to the PICs (such agreement to pay such fee, the
"Annuity Agreement"), pursuant to which we agreed to reimburse the remaining 60% of the cost of the HFC upgrade
for the PICs through repayments made over a ten or 20 year period depending on the useful life of the underlying
assets that make up the HFC upgrade incurred by the PICs. Our outstanding obligations under the Clientele
Agreements and the Annuity Agreement equaled approximately [€92.2] million as of September 30, 2003. See
"Description of Other Indebtedness."

In addition to the payments under the Clientele Agreements and Annuity Agreement we also agreed to pay the
remaining 60% of the cost of the HFC upgrade to the MICs, which had not been prefinanced. These amounts were
invoiced by Electrabel, which performed the work associated with the HFC upgrade, to the MICs, who in turn passed
them to us. As of the closing of the MixtICS Acquisition, we had [€81.0] million of these deferred payment obligations
(the "HFC Deferrals"). A portion of the proceeds of this offering will be used to repay the HFC Deferrals.

**Recent and Pending Acquisitions**

We have entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets of the Canal+ group through our newly created
subsidiary PayTVCo NV ("PayTVCo"). The proposed acquisition has been approved, subject to conditions, by the
Belgian competition authority, although the decision is subject to appeal. We intend to complete the Canal+ Acquisition
at the end of December 2003, with financial effect from December 1, 2003. If we are able to complete the acquisition,
we intend to use the acquired assets to provide analog and digital premium programming directly to both our cable
television subscribers and those of the PICs. In the longer term, we may transfer the movie studio and other
programming contracts that we would acquire from this acquisition from the Canal+ group, although we would expect
to continue to have access to content generated under those contracts.

On December 9, 2003, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Codenet NV ("Codenet"), a provider of
broadband Internet, data and voice services to business customers. This acquisition provides us with access to a
network throughout Belgium and will enable us to provide our business customers a more comprehensive range of
products and services. The acquisition has been approved by the Belgian competition authority, although that decision
may be appealed within 30 days of the publication of the decision in the Belgian Official Gazette (Belgisch
_Staatsblad)._

For more information on the Canal+ and Codenet acquisitions, see "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Current Developments."

**Our Operating Subsidiaries**

Under our current structure, Telenet Operaties provides the commercial services, marketing, customer service
and network management for our broadband Internet and data and telephony services. We provide analog cable

-----

television service to the former cable subscribers of the MICs through our MixtICS subsidiary. Telenet Vlaanderen
holds a 50-year right to use the PICs Network, of which 43 years remain and which is automatically renewable for
successive 15-year periods unless terminated with ten years' prior notice. Telenet Vlaanderen has licensed this right to
Telenet Operaties, providing Telenet Operaties access to the PICs Network to provide certain point-to-point
telecommunications, video and multimedia services.

PayTVCo has been formed to acquire certain assets, subscribers and employees of the Canal+ group. If the
acquisition of the assets is consummated, PayTVCo would hold a separate license for the provision of premium pay
television services. Codenet, together with its Luxembourg subsidiary, will provide business services to our small and
medium size and corporate, carrier and institutional customers. Codenet's other subsidiary, Phone-Plus SPRL, offers
residential telephony using a carrier preselection service.

**USE OF PROCEEDS**

We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the Notes offered hereby will be approximately [€470.0]
million (after deducting the initial purchasers' discounts and estimated expenses incurred in connection with this
offering).

We intend to use [€155.0 million of the p]roceeds to reduce existing indebtedness under tranche A and
tranche B of our senior credit facility, which, as of September 30, 2003, bore a blended interest rate of approximately
6% and on which payments of principal and interest are paid on a quarterly basis, with the final payment due on
December 31, 2009. The initial purchasers or their affiliates are mandated lead arrangers, principal lenders and agents
under this facility. We plan to use an additional [€205.0 million to repay outstanding deferred payment obligations and]
subordinated shareholder loans owed to certain shareholders of Telenet Group Holding. As of September 30, 2003,
these deferred payment obligations and loans bore interest rates of between 13% and 14% and matured no later than
December 31, 2015. Interest on the deferred payment obligations and loans is paid in kind by adding to the principal
amount of the obligations. The senior credit facility borrowings and deferred payment obligations (other than the HFC
Deferrals) were undertaken in connection with the MixtICS Acquisition.

This offering is part of a larger Refinancing, which also includes:

       - the drawdown of [€20 million under tranche C]-2 of our senior credit facility to pay certain deferred
payment obligations;

       - the drawdown of a new, non-amortizing [€300] million tranche E under our senior credit facility to pay
down amortizing tranches A and B under our senior credit facility; and

       - the issuance of U.S. dollar denominated Senior Discount Notes, resulting in net proceeds in cash of
€239.4 million (based on an exchange rate of $1.2382 = €1.00) to repay the remainder of our deferred
payment obligations and subordinated shareholder loans owed to certain shareholders of Telenet Group
Holding.

payment obligations will be paid through the proceeds of this offering with a further [€20 million repaid from amounts drawn under our]

senior credit facility. The remainder of the deferred payment obligations, together with the subordinated shareholder loans, will be
repaid from the proceeds of the issuance of the Senior Discount Notes.

(4) We intend to apply [€100 million of the net cash proceeds of the Notes offered hereby to reduce our cash pay debt. To the extent that]

we do not use those proceeds to repay bank debt within 120 days after the completion of this offering, we will be obliged to offer to
purchase the Notes at 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of purchase. See "Description of
the Notes—Par Offer."

(5) Includes approximately [€30 million of est]imated fees and expenses related to this offering, approximately [€18.8 million of estimated]

**MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF**
**FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

**Introduction**

The following discussion and analysis is based on the (i) audited consolidated annual financial statements and
unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Telenet Group Holding as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2002 and the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002, in each case prepared in
accordance with U.S. GAAP, (ii) audited consolidated annual financial statements of Telenet Bidco as of and for the
year ended December 31, 2001 prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP (comprised of results for successor and
predecessor periods reflecting Telenet Bidco's acquisition of Telenet Holding, the previous parent company of our
group, in March 2001) and (iii) unaudited U.S. GAAP information of Telenet Holding as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2000. Telenet Bidco is now a direct subsidiary of the Issuer, which itself is a direct subsidiary of Telenet
Group Holding. We have included the financial statements of Telenet Group Holding as of and for all relevant periods,
and Telenet Bidco as of and for the year ended December 31, 2001, elsewhere in this offering memorandum. You
should read these financial statements, including the notes thereto, together with the following discussion and analysis.
A summary of the critical accounting policies that have been applied to these financial statements is set forth below in
"—Critical Accounting Policies."

Telenet Group Holding and Telenet Bidco are holding companies that do not conduct any business operations
of their own. Substantially all the assets of Telenet Group Holding consist of shares of the Issuer and intercompany
loans originally made to the Issuer in connection with the acquisition of our cable network from the MICs in
August 2002. These intercompany loans bear interest at a rate that is substantially similar to the rate at which debt
incurred by Telenet Group Holding bears interest (historically the shareholder funded debt incurred in connection with
the MixtICS Acquisition in 2002). Except for the impact of presenting as equity detachable warrants issued by Telenet
Group Holding, the financial position and results of operations of Telenet Group Holding is substantially the same as the
financial position and results of operations of the Issuer for relevant periods.

Due to the MixtICS Acquisition, the financial position and results of operations of Telenet Group Holding and
Telenet Bidco as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively, are not directly
comparable. Likewise, the financial positions and results of operations of Telenet Group Holding as of and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2003 and September 30, 2002 are not directly comparable. See "—Our History" and "—
Factors Affecting Results of Operations."

Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2002 are also not comparable with those for the
year ended December 31, 2001, because, upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142, we recognized a goodwill impairment of
€667.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. The impairment is presented as a cumulative effect of
accounting change.

We also recognized a goodwill impairment of [€336.0 million for the nine months ended September] 30, 2003,
which is included in amortization expense. Accordingly, our results of operations for the nine months ended
September 30, 2003 are not comparable to our results of operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2002.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains
forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those that we discuss in these
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to,
those discussed below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum, particularly under "Risk Factors" and "Information
Regarding Forward-Looking Statements."

**Our History**

We are the largest provider of broadband cable services in Belgium. We were incorporated in September 1996
to provide telecommunications services to residential customers in Flanders. From August 1997 to August 2002 we
offered broadband Internet and telephony services only. On August 9, 2002, we acquired our cable television business
from the MICs. Our broadband network passes approximately 1.7 million homes and businesses in Flanders, to which
we are able to offer cable television, broadband Internet and telephony services. In addition, we have access to the
PICs Network, for no ongoing charge, pursuant to 50-year usage rights, of which 43 years remain and which are

64


-----

automatically renewable for successive 15-year periods unless terminated with ten years prior notice. The PICs
Network passes an additional 800,000 homes and businesses, to which we have exclusive rights to offer broadband
Internet and telephony services. The Combined Network, consisting of our owned network and the PICs Network,
was recently upgraded to an HFC standard that provides bi-directional digital transmission capabilities. Work on the
upgrade started in 1996 and was substantially completed by June 2002. See "Our History."

Prior to the MixtICS Acquisition, each of the ten MICs independently owned a cable television system which
Electrabel operated on their behalf. Accordingly, we have not presented MixtICS historical results on a combined basis
or provided _pro forma financial statements for the acquisition of MixtICS. The MixtICS Acquisition introduced the_
operations of a significant new group of businesses into our company effective August 9, 2002. As a result, the
consolidated annual financial statements of Telenet Group Holding as of and for the year ended December 31, 2002
are not directly comparable to the consolidated annual financial statements of Telenet Bidco as of and for the year
ended December 31, 2001. Furthermore, the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Telenet Group
Holding as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 are not directly comparable to the condensed
consolidated interim financial statements of Telenet Group Holding as of and for the nine months ended September 30,
2002. Furthermore, none of these financial statements necessarily reflects what our financial results and condition may
be in the future given, among other things, our rapid growth to date, the on-going integration of MixtICS (including the
related transfer of certain personnel of Electrabel to MixtICS in the near future) and our recent and pending
acquisitions. See "—Current Developments."

**Factors Affecting Results of Operations**

**_Revenues_**

Our revenues consist of cable television revenue, residential broadband Internet revenue, residential telephony
revenue and business services revenue. Approximately 93.5% of our consolidated revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2003 was derived from our residential business, including interconnection fees generated by both
residential subscribers and business customers. The remaining 6.5% of our consolidated revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 2003 was derived from our provision of business services. Our residential subscribers include
individuals and families, as well as small businesses with between one and four employees ("SoHos") that receive our
services through a coaxial connection.

_Cable Television_

Our cable television business generated approximately 39.5% of our consolidated revenues for the three
months ended September 30, 2003. We derive the majority of our cable television revenues from fixed subscription
fees, most of which are paid annually in advance by residential subscribers throughout the year. Subscription fees were
responsible for 78.8% of our cable television revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2003. In the future,
we may seek periodic increases in subscription fees for basic television services in line with cost inflation and other
factors. All subscribers to our cable television services also pay a separate copyright fee for the content that they view,
which was responsible for 14.8% of our cable television revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2003. We
earn carriage fees, paid by broadcasters, to carry certain programs over our network. These fees were responsible for
6.4% of our cable television revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2003. See "Business—Our Products
and Services—Cable Television—Programming."

Our cable television business has generated a stable revenue stream as the Belgian cable television market has
been characterized by high and steady penetration rates, limited competition and low subscriber turnover (with most
turnover and new subscriber additions resulting from house moves). As of September 30, 2003, cable television was
available to approximately 95% of all television households across Belgium. We had approximately 1.6 million
subscribers and a 94% penetration rate with respect to households passed by our network as of that date.

We expect that our cable television revenue will expand upon the successful completion of the Canal+
Acquisition. See "—Current Developments—Canal+ Acquisition."

65


-----

_Residential Broadband Internet_

Our residential broadband Internet business generated approximately 29.9% of our consolidated revenues for
the three months ended September 30, 2003. This business generates revenue primarily from fixed monthly subscription
fees paid by subscribers. We generate limited additional fees for multiple connections, add-on services and late
payments. We may also earn installation revenue, although we have to date typically promoted our residential
broadband Internet service by offering discounted installation charges or waiving installation charges altogether. See
"Business—Our Products and Services—Residential Broadband Internet" for a detailed description of our residential
broadband Internet fee structure.

Revenue growth from our residential broadband Internet business is driven primarily by net subscriber growth,
which in turn is a function of gross subscriber additions and churn. We define churn as the total number of subscribers
disconnected during a relevant period, divided by the average number of subscribers during that period.

As of September 30, 2003, we had approximately 368,000 residential broadband Internet subscribers, which
contributed to our estimated market share of 53% and penetration rate of 15.5% in Flanders.

_Residential Telephony_

Our residential telephony business represented approximately 24.1% of our consolidated revenues for the three
months ended September 30, 2003. Our residential telephony business generates revenue from a combination of fixed
monthly line rental and usage fees (consisting of fixed call-set up fees and per-minute tariffs) and interconnection fees.
We charge additional monthly fees for value-added features. Line rental and usage fees were responsible for
approximately 78.4% of our residential telephony and interconnection revenues for the three months ended
September 30, 2003. See "Business—Our Products and Services—Residential Telephony" for a detailed description of
our residential telephony tariff and pricing options. We earn interconnection revenue from other network operators,
including fixed line and mobile operators, for the termination of inbound calls to subscribers on the Combined Network,
whether residential or business. We typically do not charge subscribers an installation fee to receive residential
telephony services.

Our increase in interconnection rates that we charge for the termination of calls on the Combined Network is
currently the subject of regulatory and court proceedings with Belgacom. See "Business—Legal Proceedings—
Interconnection Litigation" and "Risk Factors—Litigation Risks—We are currently involved in a significant dispute with
Belgacom relating to the price we charge competitors to interconnect to our telephony network, and an unfavorable
outcome for us in this dispute would reduce the profitability of our telephony business."

Revenue growth from line rental and usage fees in our residential telephony business is driven primarily by net
subscriber growth, which in turn is a function of gross subscriber additions and churn.

As of September 30, 2003, we had approximately 241,000 residential telephony subscribers, which contributed
to an estimated market share of 10% in Flanders (based on number of lines) and a penetration rate of 9.8%.

Motorola has historically supplied a majority of our telephony modems. Motorola has ceased production of
these modems and we are now faced with a supply shortage. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—
The Combined Network and systems depend on equipment and service suppliers that may discontinue their products or
seek to charge us prices that are not competitive, either of which may adversely affect our business and profitability."

_Business Services_

Sales of business services generated approximately 6.5% of our consolidated revenues for the three months
ended September 30, 2003. We generate revenue from these services primarily from fees paid by customers for
Internet, data and voice services, pursuant to standard conditions with smaller businesses (with fees typically generated
on a usage basis) and individually negotiated contracts with larger businesses. We expect revenues in this business to
increase with our recent acquisition of Codenet. See "—Current Developments—Codenet Acquisition" and
"Business—Our Products and Services—Business Services."

**_Expenses_**

Our principal expenses consist of operating expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses and
depreciation and amortization expenses.

_Operating Expenses_

Our operating expenses consist of interconnection costs, network operating and maintenance and repair costs,
cable programming costs and payroll expenses for operational staff. We present depreciation and amortization
separately from our operating expenses and capitalize most of our installation costs, including labor costs. See "—
Depreciation and Amortization Expenses."

Interconnection fees for calls made by our residential subscribers and business customers that terminate
outside the Combined Network constitute the majority of our operating expenses. Interconnection rates for calls made
to mobile networks are significantly higher than rates for calls that terminate on fixed lines. We expect interconnection
fees for calls made to mobile networks to increase in the future as our customer base grows and a greater proportion
of calls are terminated on mobile networks.

Network operating costs consist of infrastructure costs (including information technology, network and supplier
maintenance costs, payments under network operating agreements with the PICs, costs to supply electricity to our
network and internet connectivity costs), building costs, expenses associated with disconnecting cable television
services and pole rental fees paid to Electrabel. In addition, we incur expense for network repair and maintenance. We
also include bad debt expense within operating expenses.

Cable programming costs consist primarily of copyright fees paid to copyright beneficiaries and their agents.
Copyright fees were responsible for a substantial portion of our cable programming costs for the three months ended
September 30, 2003. The basis for our calculation of these fees is currently the subject of litigation. See "Business—
Legal Proceedings." Cable programming costs also consist of carriage fees paid to some commercial broadcasters to
distribute their cable television content. Our cable programming costs will increase, and our margins will be lower, upon
the successful completion of the Canal+ Acquisition. See "—Current Developments—Canal+ Acquisition."

_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_

Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist of payroll expenses for non-operational staff,
advertising, marketing, office, transport and external services costs (including management fees paid to Cable
Partners LLC and audit, legal and insurance fees). Selling, general and administrative costs also include sales
commissions payable to our retail and door-to-door salesforces and customer billing and administration costs. We
expect selling, general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as a consequence of subscriber growth.

_Depreciation and Amortization Expenses_

Depreciation and amortization expense is principally related to the depreciation of our broadband network and
capitalized installation, modem and network interface unit costs, and amortization of intangible assets. We capitalize
installation costs associated with the addition of new subscribers. Costs associated with subsequent installations of
additional services are capitalized to the extent that they are incremental and directly attributable to the installation of
expanded services. Installation costs include direct labor costs. We depreciate capitalized installation costs on a
straight-line basis over five to 20 year periods.

We compute depreciation on a straight-line basis using estimated useful lives of 33 years (for buildings and
improvements), three to 20 years (for operating facilities) and three to ten years (for other equipment). We amortize
intangible assets with a finite life (comprised primarily of network user rights, software development and acquisition
costs, customer lists and trademarks) on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which range from three
to 20 years.

For our residential broadband Internet and telephony businesses, we incur capital expenditure for Internet and
telephony modems and network interface units. We retain ownership of modems and network interface units and do
not charge customers rental fees for them. See "—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditure."

67


-----

We expect to introduce VoIP telephony by the fourth quarter of 2004. Among other things, VoIP offers the
potential for cost savings because it can be offered using significantly less expensive telephony modems than those we
currently use and it gives us the ability to install, where appropriate, a single modem for both Internet and telephony
service. The deployment of VoIP would also help address our current shortage of Motorola telephony modems
although problems may arise that could interfere with its planned roll-out. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Business—If we fail to successfully introduce new technologies or services, such as VoIP telephony, or to respond to
technological developments, our business and level of revenues may be adversely affected" and "Risks Related to Our
Business—The Combined Network and systems depend on equipment and service suppliers that may discontinue their
products or seek to charge us prices that are not competitive, either of which may adversely affect our business and
profitability."

We anticipate increases in depreciation and amortization expense in line with subscriber growth and following
currently planned capital expenditure related to subscriber growth, the upgrade of the upstream capacity of our coaxial
network and other network and information technology investments. See "—Liquidity and Capital Resources" and
"Business—The Combined Network—HFC Upgrade."

**_Other Income (Expense)_**

Other income (expense) consists of interest income (expense) and foreign exchange gain (loss). Interest
income is generated by cash balances and short-term liquid investments. Interest expense represents amounts payable
on our various debt obligations including, primarily, variable interest payments under our senior credit facility and on
certain deferred payment obligations incurred in connection with our acquisition of MixtICS. See note 7 to our annual
financial statements, "Our History—MixtICS Acquisition" and "Description of Other Indebtedness." Interest expense
also includes the interest portion of payments to Interkabel under the Clientele Agreements and Annuity Agreement
(and to the MICs under the Clientele Agreement prior to August 2002), the magnitude of which increased as the
completion of the upgrade of the PICs Network to the HFC standard progressed. As we substantially completed the
HFC upgrade in June 2002, we expect Clientele Agreement and Annuity Agreement interest expense to remain stable
in the future. However, the interest component of such agreements is, to an extent, variable depending upon levels of
inflation. See "Our History—Network Upgrade."

Our primary source of foreign exchange exposure has historically been vendor supply contracts denominated in
U.S. dollars, although over time we have been successful in reducing this exposure. We expect to experience greater
exposure to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/euro exchange rate following the offering of Notes (as a consequence of
Telenet Group Holding's obligations under the Senior Discount Notes) and upon the successful completion of the
Canal+ Acquisition (as most of Canal+'s programming contracts require payments in U.S. dollars).

Following the completion of the Refinancing, overall interest expense will decrease, although the cash portion
of our interest expense will increase substantially. Giving effect to the Refinancing, we estimate that we would have
paid additional cash interest (excluding withholding tax, commitment fees, currency hedging costs and other borrowing
expenses and interest income generated on the incremental cash balance resulting from the Refinancing) of
approximately [€29] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. This is because certain of our deferred
obligations that we intend to repay in connection with the Notes offered hereby and the related Refinancing provide for
in kind, and not cash, interest payments. This calculation assumes that interest payments on principal amounts under the
senior credit facility would have been payable at applicable margins and EURIBOR rates existing under the facility for
the nine months ended September 30, 2003. See "Description of Other Indebtedness" and " —Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Interest Rate and Related Risk." We incurred [€42.6] million in cash
interest payable to our lenders under the senior credit facility for the nine months ended September 30, 2003.

**Current Developments**

**_Canal+ Acquisition_**

Canal+ currently provides a choice of analog and digital premium movie, sports and other programming to
approximately 102,000 of our cable subscribers on our network, as well as approximately 44,000 subscribers on the
PICs Network, through a proprietary set top box connected to their televisions. Canal+ directly bills the cable users
who subscribe to its service and pays the PICs and us carriage fees equal to half of the profits generated by the

68


-----

relevant subscriber base. See "Business—Our Products and Services—Cable Television."

We have entered an agreement to acquire the Canal+ Assets. The Belgian competition authorities have
approved the acquisition subject to certain conditions, including the sale to other third parties of the assets of Canal+ in
the French-speaking region of Belgium and receipt of consents from the movie studios that supply programming to
Canal+. We intend to complete the Canal+ Acquisition at the end of December 2003, with financial effect from
December 1, 2003. See "Business—Our Products and Services—Cable Television—Premium Services" and
"Business—Legal Proceedings—Canal+ Litigation."

Upon completion, the Canal+ Acquisition will enable us to provide the same analog and digital premium
programming to our cable television subscribers as Canal+ has traditionally provided under our contractual
arrangements. We will also be able to offer such programming to cable television subscribers of the PICs with whom
we will seek to have direct relationships, in return for paying a carriage fee to the PICs to access their network. As our
core business is distribution, in the longer term we may transfer to a third party the programming contracts we will
acquire from Canal+. Once the acquisition is completed, we will become subject to the programming contracts to
which Canal+ is currently subject, obligating us to pay studios and others for content rights on a minimum guaranteed
subscriber basis irrespective of the actual numbers of subscribers purchasing content.

Our cable television revenue base will expand with sales of Canal+ premium movie, sports and other content to
our subscribers and those of the PICs. These revenues will be partially offset by the loss of the carriage fees we
currently receive from Canal+. We will also incur significant additional cable programming costs associated with the
acquired content rights and our margins will be negatively affected.

In addition, we anticipate that a successful completion of the Canal+ Acquisition will allow us to resolve
existing litigation with Canal+ concerning our termination of our contractual arrangements. See "Business—Legal
Proceedings—Canal+ Litigation." Because our ability to use nine 8 MHz channels provided to Canal+ under the
contractual arrangements that we have terminated would then be undisputed, we would not expect to incur in the
foreseeable future the capital expenditure that would otherwise be necessary to increase the downstream capacity of
our network for iDTV services.

**_Codenet Acquisition_**

On December 9, 2003, we acquired Codenet, a broadband Internet, data and voice provider operating primarily
in the business market throughout Belgium. The completion of this acquisition has been approved by the Belgian
competition authorities, subject to a possible appeal of the authority's decision within 30 days from publication of the
decision in the Belgian Official Gazette (Belgisch Staatsblad). This acquisition expands our backbone network across
all of Belgium and parts of Luxembourg, allowing us to directly provide business services throughout Belgium. We
expect that the transaction will further increase our ability to offer our business customers comprehensive product sets,
including leased lines and voice and data packages. Codenet's ATM network capabilities, for example, permit the
offering of frame relay technology, which businesses commonly use as a secure means of data transport. The
acquisition is therefore expected to allow us to more efficiently market to a broader base of small and medium sized
enterprises ("SMEs") and to companies operating on a national level with an enhanced product set and geographic
coverage. See "Business—Our Products and Services—Business Services—Codenet Acquisition."

We anticipate that the Codenet acquisition will allow us to generate additional customer revenue. However,
Codenet has lower operating margins than Telenet because of, among other things, Codenet's use of leased lines
provided by Belgacom. Over time, we expect to replace Belgacom as Codenet's provider of leased lines in Flanders, to
the extent possible.

In connection with the Canal+ Acquisition and our recent acquisition of Codenet, we have agreed to pay
combined purchase prices of approximately [€45] million in cash, including transaction expenses, and the acquired
business will have a negative cash impact on our financial position during the next two years. See "—Liquidity and
Capital Resources."

-----

**_MixtICS Integration_**

Under a services and transfer agreement entered into by Electrabel and MixtICS at the time of the MixtICS
Acquisition (the "Services and Transfer Agreement"), to be amended as of the closing of the offering, Electrabel
agreed to provide MixtICS with operational services following the acquisition. We subsequently have integrated many
of these services into our business (including network maintenance and repair) and are in the process of integrating the
remaining services (including network installation, payroll, billing, financial control and logistics). We plan to complete
this integration by the middle of 2004. As we continue to migrate the cable television functions from Electrabel, we
expect some increases in expenses for certain services as compared with fees charged by Electrabel for the relevant
services under the Services and Transfer Agreement. We also expect increased education and training costs
associated with the transfer of approximately 400 employees from Electrabel. See note 14 to our annual financial
statements. Management expects to offset the additional costs, in part, by improved efficiencies in network
maintenance and repair and employee utilization rates.

Concurrently with the integration of MixtICS, we plan to migrate all of our businesses, including MixtICS, to an
integrated data management and reporting platform using an Oracle enterprise resource planning ("ERP") system, for
which we expect to incur limited capital expenditure and which could initially result in difficulties in our data collection
and customer service.

___________

(1) Each subscriber is counted as a revenue generating unit, or "RGU," for each service subscribed. Thus, a subscriber who receives from us
cable television, broadband Internet and residential telephony services (regardless of its number of telephony access lines) would be
counted as three RGUs. RGUs are presented as at the relevant period end date.

(2) Includes households and SoHos that receive our broadband Internet and telephony services through a coaxial connection.

(3) These statistics also include approximately 35,000, 33,000, 32,000 and 29,000 RGUs who used our carrier preselection services at
December 31, 2002, March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003, respectively.

(4) Consists of SME RGUs that receive our broadband Internet and telephony services through a coaxial connection. We had
approximately 14,000, 15,000, 16,000 and 17,000 of such SME broadband Internet customers, and 3,000, 4,000, 4,000 and 4,000 of
such SME telephony customers, respectively, at December 31, 2002, March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003,
respectively. We also provide business services to SME and corporate RGUs that receive our services using a fiber connection, which
RGUs are not included in the above RGU calculations.

(5) Includes interconnection fees generated by residential and business customers.

(6) Defined as operating income before depreciation and amortization.

(7) Revenue earned for the period divided by the number of months in the period and divided by the average number of RGUs for the
period (which average number of RGUs may vary from the number of RGUs presented above at the period end date).

(8) Average monthly revenue per subscriber includes copyright fees and other revenue earned from carriage fees.

(9) Average monthly revenue per subscriber excludes interconnection revenue and installation fees, but includes revenue generated by
RGUs who use our carrier preselection services. See footnote 3. Average monthly revenue per subscriber excluding RGUs who use our
carrier preselection services was [€38.2, €38.1, €37.8 and €35.9 for the three months ended December] 31, 2002, March 31, 2003,
June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003, respectively.

(10) Total number of RGUs disconnected during the period divided by the average number of RGUs for the period, multiplied by four.

(11) Includes SMEs that receive our services through a coaxial connection.

(12) Excludes RGUs who use our carrier preselection services and includes SMEs that receive our services through a coaxial connection. See
footnote 3. We exclude RGUs who use our carrier preselection services from our residential telephony churn statistics because, for the
most part, these customers subscribe to our direct access telephony services upon ceasing to subscribe to our carrier preselection
services.

(13) Number of RGUs at the end of the relevant period as a percentage of the number of homes and businesses, as applicable, passed by our
network at the end of the relevant period (in the case of cable television) or by the Combined Network as of September 30, 2003 (in the
case of residential broadband Internet and telephony).

(14) Penetration rates estimated where limited data available.

(15) Includes SMEs that receive our broadband Internet and telephony services through a coaxial connection.

Our consolidated revenue and EBITDA increase during the Quarterly Periods reflects price increases in our
cable television business and subscriber growth across our residential broadband Internet and, to a lesser extent
residential telephony, businesses.

71


-----

Growth in our cable television revenues primarily reflects the recent increase in our cable television
subscription fees pursuant to an approval we received from the Pricing Commission of the Belgian Ministry of
Economic Affairs in response to cost inflation since the MICs' prior subscription fee increase in 1994. We increased
subscription fees, which we charge on a twelve-month rolling basis, by an average of 15% in January 2003 (from [€6.67]
to [€7.67, excluding VAT and copyright fees, as measured on a monthly basis) and by a further 10% of the original]
amount in July 2003 (to [€8.34, excluding VAT and copyright fees, as measured on a monthly basis). Cable television]
revenues also increased following our August 2003 increase in monthly copyright fees by [€0.73 pe]r subscriber (to [€]
1.81 per subscriber).

During the Quarterly Periods, we experienced steady net growth in our residential broadband Internet
subscriber base, from approximately 253,000 residential broadband Internet subscribers at September 30, 2002 to
approximately 368,000 residential broadband Internet subscribers at September 30, 2003. ARPU fluctuations are
mostly the result of promotions that impact revenue, such as the provision of limited periods of free residential
broadband Internet service. In part because of the scheduling of many marketing promotions in the fourth quarter of
the year and in part because of seasonal trends, commitments to purchase residential broadband Internet service by
new subscribers tend to be highest during the fourth quarter, and lowest during the second and third quarters, of each
year. We experienced a churn rate of 8.1% between September 30, 2002 and September 30, 2003, with churn
increasing in the fourth quarter of 2002 as we enhanced collection procedures (following interruptions in connection
with the implementation of our OASIS information technology platform during 2002) and measures to terminate
services of non-paying customers.

Our residential telephony subscriber base also grew during the Quarterly Periods, from approximately 221,000
subscribers at September 30, 2002 to approximately 241,000 subscribers at September 30, 2003. ARPU fluctuations
are the result of promotions that impact revenue (such as the provision of free telephony minutes and limited periods of
reduced monthly line rentals) as well as differences in usage-related fees generated by our residential telephony
business, which tend to be highest during the fourth quarter of the year and lowest in the summer months during the
third quarter. Usage-related fees also vary according to the number of business days in a particular month. ARPU
declined during the Quarterly Periods as a result of the impact of fixed to mobile telephony substitution on usage fees,
and promotional activities relating to the re-launch of our telephony product in the first quarter of 2003. Revenue was
basically steady during the Quarterly Periods as a result of the foregoing factors and the growth in our subscriber base.
We experienced a churn rate of 10.8% between September 30, 2002 and September 30, 2003, with churn increasing in
the fourth quarter of 2002 as a result of enhanced collection procedures (following interruptions in connection with the
implementation of our OASIS information technology platform during 2002) and measures to terminate services of nonpaying customers.

EBITDA during the Quarterly Periods was positively impacted by the growth of our customer base, as
described above. This subscriber growth, together with the fixed nature of many of our operating and selling, general
and administrative expenses and implementation of cost savings initiatives beginning in the first quarter of 2003, led to
an improvement in our profitability. Our EBITDA margin increased from 42.8% for the three months ended
December 31, 2002 to 49.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2003. Beginning with the three months ended
December 31, 2003, our EBITDA and EBITDA margin could be adversely affected by fluctuations in expenses
related to our acquisition of Codenet and our pending acquisition of the Canal+ Assets.

**Nine Months Ended September 30, 2002 Compared to Nine Months Ended September 30, 2003**

The financial information for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and September 30, 2003 included in
the discussion set forth below is derived from Telenet Group Holding's unaudited financial statements for the periods.

**_Revenues_**

Revenues increased by [€159.6] million, or 79.9%, from [€ 199.5] million for the nine months ended September 30,
2002 to [€ 359.1] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. Our cable television business, which we
acquired from the MICs and began operating in August 2002, generated [€137.0] million, or 38.2%, of our consolidated
revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, while our residential broadband Internet and telephony
businesses generated [€105.9] million and [€91.5] million, or 29.5% and 25.5%, of our consolidated revenues for the nine

75


-----

months ended September 30, 2003, respectively. Sales of business services were [€24.7] million, or 6.9% of our
consolidated revenues, for the nine months ended September 30, 2003.

_Cable Television_

Following the acquisition of our cable television business in August 2002, we generated [€137.0] million of cable
television revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, compared with [€25.4] million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2002. During that period, we increased our cable television subscription fees (by an average of
15% in January 2003 and a further 10% of the original amount in July 2003). We also increased copyright fees in
August 2003.

_Residential Broadband Internet_

Revenues generated by our residential broadband Internet business continued to grow, by 48.1%, from
€71.5 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 to €105.9 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2003. Increased residential broadband Internet revenues were primarily the result of net growth, at 45%, of residential
broadband Internet subscribers for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. ARPU remained static as a result of
increased promotional activities being offset by increased sales of value-added services.

_Residential Telephony_

Residential telephony revenue (including interconnection revenue for both residential subscribers and business
customers) increased for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, by 12.5%, from [€81.3] million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2002 to [€91.5] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. This increase was primarily
due to our August 2002 increase in interconnection fees and subscriber growth, at 9%, for the nine months ended
September 30, 2003. The fee increase is the subject of litigation. See "Business—Legal Proceedings—Interconnection
Litigation."

In the first half of 2002, management decided to de-emphasize marketing telephony during a period of limited
cash expenditure prior to the MixtICS Acquisition. We re-launched our residential telephony product in early 2003. The
promotions we employed as part of the re-launch, such as the provision of free telephony minutes and limited periods of
reduced monthly line rentals, and differences in usage-related fees, had a negative impact on ARPU. ARPU was also
reduced by the effects of fixed to mobile telephony substitution on call usage revenues.

Management believes that revenues were negatively affected by tromboning, a practice whereby certain
telephony operators divert abroad calls that originate in Belgium and then route the calls back to Belgium in order to
qualify for reduced international interconnection fees.

_Business Services_

Business services revenues increased by 15.6%, from [€21.3] million for the nine months ended September 30,
2002 to [€24.7] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. This increase reflects a balanced contribution
from growth in our business customer base and the reallocation of revenues generated by SME residential subscribers
that receive services through a coaxial connection to our business services operations.

**_Expenses_**

_Operating Expenses_

Operating expenses increased by [€19.8] million, or 20.2%, from [€ 97.9] million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2002 to [€ 117.7] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2003, operating expenses increased primarily as a result of the inclusion of cable programming costs in
our results of operations following the August 2002 MixtICS Acquisition. As a percentage of revenues, operating
expenses were 49.1% for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and 32.8% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2003.

Bad debt expense decreased substantially for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, as compared with

76


-----

higher amounts for the nine months ended September 30, 2002, following collection interruptions in connection with our
implementation of our OASIS information technology platform during 2002. We took steps to reduce bad debt in the
last quarter of 2002, including enhanced collection procedures and measures to terminate services of non-paying
customers beginning in the last quarter of 2002. On a per subscriber basis, operating costs improved for the nine
months ended September 30, 2003 as a result of increased efficiencies in subcontractor costs and reduced equipment
fault rates, among other factors.

_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by [€9.0] million, or 13.9%, from [€65.1] million for the nine
months ended September 30, 2002 to [€74.1] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. Expenses increased
due to our acquisition of our cable television business from the MICs and increased marketing and advertising
expenditure in line with revenue growth partially offset by certain cost savings initiatives.

Our EBITDA margin increased from 18.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 to 46.6% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2003.

_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_

Depreciation expense increased by [€29.6] million, from [€76.7] million for the nine months ended September 30,
2002 to [€106.3] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, following the August 2002 MixtICS Acquisition,
growth in our subscriber base and subscriber related capital expenditure. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation
expenses were 38.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and 29.6% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2003.

Amortization expense increased by [€328.9] million, from [€ 29.0] million for the nine months ended September 30,
2002 to [€ 357.9] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. This increase was caused primarily by a
€336 million impairment of our goodwill relating to an impairment analysis under SFAS No. 142 performed in the third
quarter of 2003. In addition, as of August 2002 we eliminated amortization of network user rights relating to our prior
co-ownership of the MICs cable television network. See note 6 to our interim financial statements.

**_Operating Loss_**

Operating loss increased by [€227.8] million, from [€69.2] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 to
€297.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, as a result of the factors described above.

**_Other Income (Expense)_**

_Interest Income (Expense)_

Net interest expense increased significantly, from [€94.0] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002
to [€133.5] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, primarily due to our increased debt level following the
completion of the MixtICS Acquisition in August 2002 and, to a lesser extent, more interest paid to Interkabel under the
Clientele and Annuity Agreements as fees payable increased in proportion to costs related to our HFC network
upgrade. This was partially offset by the termination of the interest component of payments to the MICs under the
Clientele Agreement following our acquisition of MixtICS. See "Our History—MixtICS Acquisition" and "Description
of Other Indebtedness." As a percentage of revenues, net interest expense was 47.1% for the nine months ended
September 30, 2002 and 37.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2003.

_Foreign Exchange Income (Expense)_

Net foreign exchange gain increased from approximately [€36,000 for the nine months ended September] 30,
2002 to approximately [€45,000 for the nine months ended September] 30, 2003, as we reduced our exposure to foreign
currency fluctuations and as the euro appreciated relative to the U.S. dollar.

**_Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change, Net of Taxes_**

77


-----

We did not record any cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the nine months ended
September 30, 2003. In connection with our adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2002, we determined that goodwill was
impaired and recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of [€ 668] million (net of taxes). See
note 6 to our annual financial statements.

**_Net Loss_**

Net loss decreased by [€400.3] million, from [€830.7] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 to
€430.4 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003, as a result of the factors described above.

**Year Ended December 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2002**

The financial information included in the discussion set forth below is derived from Telenet Bidco's audited
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2001 and Telenet Group Holding's audited financial statements
for the year ended December 31, 2002.

**_Revenues_**

Revenues increased in 2002 by [€134.8] million, or 78.2%, from [€ 172.3] million for the year ended December 31,
2001 to [€ 307.1] million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Our cable television business, which we acquired from
the MICs and began operating in August 2002, generated [€64.2] million, or 20.9%, of our consolidated revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2002, while our residential broadband Internet and telephony businesses generated [€]
101.1 million and [€112.4] million, or 32.9% and 36.6%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues for the year ended
December 31, 2002. Sales of business services represented [€29.4] million, or 9.6%, of our consolidated revenues for the
year ended December 31, 2002.

_Cable Television_

We acquired our cable television business in August 2002. We did not generate any cable television revenue
for the year ended December 31, 2001 or any other preceding period. Revenues for the year ended December 31,
2002 included cable television revenue from August 9, 2002.

_Residential Broadband Internet_

Revenues generated by our residential broadband Internet business grew significantly for the year ended
December 31, 2002, by 54.0%, from [€ 65.7] million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to [€ 101.1] million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. This growth was primarily a result of growth, at 47%, of residential broadband
Internet subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2002 and an increase in subscription fees in February 2002.
ARPU increased for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily as a result of this subscription fee increase. Churn
increased for the year ended December 31, 2002 as we enhanced our collection procedures and measures to terminate
services of non-paying customers.

_Residential Telephony_

Residential telephony revenue (including interconnection revenue for both residential subscribers and business
customers) increased by 36.3%, from [€82.5] million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to [€ 112.4] million for the
year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was attributable to 37% growth in average subscriptions for 2002 as
compared to 2001, an increase in subscription fees in February 2002 and our August 2002 increase in interconnection
fees. Our interconnection fee increase is the subject of litigation. See "Business—Legal Proceedings—Interconnection
Litigation." ARPU decreased, however, because of the effects of fixed to mobile telephony substitution on call usage
revenues. This decrease was partially offset by the increase in our interconnection and subscription fees. For the year
ended December 31, 2002, management believes that revenues were negatively impacted by tromboning. Churn
decreased for the year ended December 31, 2002 owing to improved customer care.

_Business Services_

Business services revenues increased by 21.8%, from [€24.1] million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to

78


-----

€29.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This increase was driven primarily by growth in our business
customer base.

**_Expenses_**

_Operating Expenses_

Operating expenses increased by [€25.8] million, or 24.1%, from [€ 107.2] million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 to [€133.0] million for the year ended December 31, 2002. As a percentage of revenues, operating
expenses were 62.2% for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 43.3% for the year ended December 31, 2002.

For the year ended December 31, 2002, we incurred higher bad debt expense and provisioning following
collection interruptions in connection with the implementation of our OASIS information technology platform during
2002. In addition, cable programming costs were included in our results of operations following the August 2002
MixtICS Acquisition. Although we experienced higher interconnection fees as our residential telephony subscriber base
grew, interconnection expense was negatively impacted by decreased interconnection rates.

Network repair and maintenance expenses were higher for the year ended December 31, 2002 compared to
the year ended December 31, 2001, primarily as a result of the impact of the acquisition of our cable television business
from the MICs.

_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by [€7.8] million, or 9.3%, from [€83.7] million for the year
ended December 31, 2001 to [€91.5] million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This growth was primarily the result
of increased payroll, marketing and advertising expenditure, in line with revenue growth during the year ended
December 31, 2002, together with costs associated with headcount reductions in 2002, offset by lower payroll expenses
following those headcount reductions.

Our EBITDA margin improved from (10.8)% for the year ended December 31, 2001 to 26.9% for the year
ended December 31, 2002.

_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_

Depreciation expense increased by [€41.5] million, or 61.1%, from [€ 67.9] million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 to [€109.4] million for the year ended December 31, 2002, following the August 2002 acquisition of
our network from the MICs and growth in our subscriber base and subscriber related capital expenditure. As a
percentage of revenues, depreciation expense was 39.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001 and 35.6% for the
year ended December 31, 2002.

Amortization expense decreased by [€78.1] million, or 68.2%, from [€114.5] million for the year ended
December 31, 2001 to [€ 36.5] million for the year ended December 31, 2002. This decrease was caused primarily by
the elimination, as of August 2002, of amortization of network user rights relating to our prior co-ownership of the
MICs cable television network and amortization of goodwill, following our adoption of SFAS No. 142 in January 2002.
See note 6 to our annual financial statements.

**_Operating Loss_**

Operating loss decreased by [€137.8] million, from [€ ] 201.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to
€63.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as a result of the factors described above.

**_Other Income (Expense)_**

_Interest Income (Expense)_

Net interest expense increased by 6.7%, from [€125.8] million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to
€134.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, primarily due to our increased debt level following the completion

79


-----

of the MixtICS Acquisition and, to a lesser extent, more interest paid to Interkabel and the MICs (until August 2002)
under the Clientele Agreements and Annuity Agreement as fees payable increased in proportion to costs related to our
HFC network upgrade. As a percentage of revenues, net interest expense was 73.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2001 and 43.7% for the year ended December 31, 2002.

_Foreign Exchange Income (Expense)_

For the year ended December 31, 2001, we had net foreign exchange loss of [€921,000, compared to net]
foreign exchange gain of approximately [€722,000 for the year ended December] 31, 2002, as we reduced our exposure
to foreign currency fluctuations, and as the euro appreciated relative to the U.S. dollar.

**_Cumulative Effect of Accounting Change, Net of Taxes_**

In connection with our adoption of SFAS No. 142 in 2002, we determined that goodwill was impaired and
recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of [€667.6] million (net of taxes). See note 6 to our
annual financial statements.

**_Net Loss_**

Net loss increased by [€536.7] million, from [€327.8] million for the year ended December 31, 2001 to
€864.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as a result of the factors described above.

**Year Ended December 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2001**

The financial information for the years ended December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001 included in the
discussion set forth below is derived from unaudited financial information of Telenet Holding for the year ended
December 31, 2000 and Telenet Bidco's audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2001.

**_Revenues_**

Revenues increased by [€83.0] million, or 93.0%, from [€89.3] million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to
€172.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Our residential broadband Internet and telephony businesses
generated [€65.7] million and [€ 82.5] million, or 38.1% and 47.9%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues for the year
ended December 31, 2001. Sales of business services represented [€24.1] million, or 14.0%, of our consolidated
revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001. Revenues generated by our residential broadband Internet and
telephony businesses increased for the year ended December 31, 2001 as a result of growth of these subscriber bases,
at 130% and 89%, respectively. In our residential telephony business, this growth was partially offset by 26.8% lower
interconnection revenues for the year ended December 31, 2001, as interconnection rates declined. Revenues
generated by our business services increased for the year ended December 31, 2001 primarily as a result of modest
growth in our business customer base.

**_Expenses_**

_Operating Expenses_

Operating expenses increased by [€22.1] million, or 26.0%, from [€ 85.1] million for the year ended December 31,
2000 to [€107.2] million for the year ended December 31, 2001. As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were
95.2% for the year ended December 31, 2000 and 62.2% for the year ended December 31, 2001.

For the year ended December 31, 2001, we experienced higher interconnection fees as our residential
telephony subscriber base grew and a greater proportion of telephone calls were terminated on mobile networks, with
higher associated termination fees. Interconnection fees increased by 83.6%, from [€22.4] million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 to [€41.2] million for the year ended December 31, 2001.

_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by [€15.0] million, or 21.8%, from [€68.7 million] for the
year ended December 31, 2000 to [€83.7] million for the year ended December 31, 2001 as a result of increased payroll,
advertising and marketing fees, and as we began to pay management fees to CAI.

Our EBITDA margin improved from (72.1)% for the year ended December 31, 2000 to (10.8)% for the year
ended December 31, 2001.

_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_

Depreciation expense increased by [€21.7] million, or 47.0%, from [€ 46.2] million for the year ended
December 31, 2000 to [€67.9] million for the year ended December 31, 2001, in line with growth in our subscriber base
and subscriber related capital expenditure. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation expense was 51.7% for the year
ended December 31, 2000 and 39.4% for the year ended December 31, 2001.

Amortization expense increased by [€98.4] million, from [€16.1] million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to
€ 114.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. Amortization of installation costs increased in line with growth
in our subscriber base during the period. Amortization expense also increased beginning with the acquisition of our
group by Cable Partners Europe, LLC in March 2001 due to the allocation to goodwill of the excess of the purchase
price over the carrying value of acquired net assets.

Operating loss increased by [€74.4] million, from [€126.7] million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to
€201.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as a result of the factors described above.

**_Other Income (Expense)_**

_Interest Income (Expense)_

Net interest expense increased from [€26.2] million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to [€125.8] million for
the year ended December 31, 2001, primarily due to payments on debt incurred in conjunction with the acquisition of
our group by CAI in March 2001 and senior debt borrowings to fund our operating cash flow needs. As a percentage
of revenues, net interest expense was 29.4% for the year ended December 31, 2000 and 73.0% for the year ended
December 31, 2001.

_Foreign Exchange Income (Expense)_

For the year ended December 31, 2000, we had net foreign exchange loss of approximately [€956,000]
compared to net foreign exchange loss of approximately [€921,000 for the year ended December] 31, 2001.

**_Net Loss_**

Net loss increased by [€173.9] million, from [€153.9] million for the year ended December 31, 2000 to
€327.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as a result of the factors described above.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Historical Cash Flows_**

Because the closing of the MixtICS Acquisition introduced the operations of a substantial new business to our
group effective August 9, 2002, our consolidated statements of cash flows for the nine months ended September 30,
2003 and for the year ended December 31, 2002 are not directly comparable to our consolidated statements of cash
flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and for the year ended December 31, 2001.

The following table sets forth the components of our historical cash flows for the periods indicated:

_Cash Flows From (Used in) Operating Activities_

Net cash from operating activities increased from [€5.8 million for the nine months ended September] 30, 2002
to [€115.7] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. This increase reflects the August 2002 acquisition of
our cable television business, as enhanced by increases in subscription fees paid by our cable television subscribers and
interconnection fees paid by users of our residential telephony services network and growth in our subscriber base
during the period, together with the impact of cost savings initiatives.

Net cash from operating activities was [€11.1 million for the year ended December] 31, 2002 compared with net
cash used in operating activities of [€35.4] million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as our operating margins
improved and the MixtICS Acquisition was successfully completed.

_Cash Flows From (Used in) Investing Activities_

Net cash from investing activities decreased by 83.0%, from [€433.6 million for the nine months ended]
September 30, 2002 to [€73.5 million for the nine months ended September] 30, 2003. This decrease primarily reflects
the August 2002 acquisition of our cable television business and the additional capital expenditure we incurred during
the period in related network maintenance.

Net cash used in investing activities was [€230.2 m]illion for the year ended December 31, 2001 and [€457.6]
million for the year ended December 31, 2002, reflecting the acquisition of our cable television business in 2002. For the
year ended December 31, 2002, cash used in investing activities, excluding acquisitions, was [€65.4] million compared to
€200.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as a result of slower growth in our residential telephony business
and reduced expenditure prior to the MixtICS Acquisition.

_Cash Flows From (Used in) Financing Activities_

Net cash provided by financing activities was [€453.6 million for the nine months ended September] 30, 2002
while net cash used in financing activities was [€6.7 million for the nine months ended September] 30, 2003. This
movement primarily reflects cash provided in connection with the financing of the cable television acquisition in
August 2002 and cash used to service that debt for the nine months ended September 30, 2003.

Net cash from financing activities was [€232.7 million for the year ended] December 31, 2001 and [€454.7 million]
for the year ended December 31, 2002, reflecting our financing of the acquisition of our cable television business in
2002 and cash used to service that debt for the year ended December 31, 2002. In the first half of 2002, we
experienced a period of limited cash expenditure which lasted until the closing of our purchase of MixtICS in
August 2002 and related increase in our cash flows from operations.

**_Capital Expenditure_**

Our business is highly capital intensive. We incurred capital expenditure of [€200.5] million and [€67.4] million,
respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2002. Management estimates that
subscriber-related costs represented approximately 53% and 75% of these amounts, respectively. Capital expenditure

82


-----

was [€43.4] million for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and [€ 73.5] million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2003. Management estimates that subscriber-related costs represented approximately 95% and 53% of
these amounts, respectively. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, our capital expenditure was funded
primarily from cash flows from operating activities. For previous periods, we funded capital expenditure from drawings
under our senior credit facility.

A substantial portion of our capital expenditure is variable, being directly related to subscriber growth or related
to the general increasing capacity requirements that accompany subscriber growth. In addition, a portion of our capital
expenditure consists of specific non-recurring projects. The remainder is capital expenditure that we are not
contractually committed to incur, but which we believe is appropriate for network quality reasons or in respect of new
home builds. In 2004, we anticipate capital expenditure of between [€140 million and €160 million. Of this amount,]
approximately 40% is for capital expenditure related to subscriber growth (including for modems, labor and other
installation costs), while approximately 30% is for network and other infrastructure investments, which is also related to
subscriber growth (including for voicemail, e-mail mailboxes, backbone capacity and user licenses, which grow with our
subscriber base). The remaining 30% is for the funding of network maintenance, replacement and extensions, office
and administration costs, product development and testing and information technology costs. In the short term, we
believe we could defer a significant portion of these remaining costs if liquidity were limited before significant network
performance issues would arise. In the longer term, we would need to continue such investment to maintain the level of
service and performance we seek to offer our customers.

Our anticipated capital expenditure for 2004 includes specific costs relating to the integration of Codenet, a
billing systems upgrade, up-front costs for the deployment of VoIP, the upstream upgrade of our network and our
ExpressNet™ high speed Internet product. These specific projects represent an estimated [€30 million of our]
anticipated capital expenditure in 2004. We have not formulated a plan to install our iDTV platform. We believe that
the installation of an iDTV platform would require additional capital expenditure of between [€30 million and €35 million,]
excluding set-top boxes (the cost of which we anticipate passing on to subscribers), as well as subscriber acquisition
and content costs. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile—We are contractually obligated to
launch a digital television platform by March 2005, and our financial condition and cash flows may be impaired by our
efforts to launch digital television and any liability we incur if we fail to launch digital television."

Our assumptions regarding the costs associated with maintenance and upgrades of the Combined Network and
our coaxial network may prove to be inaccurate, including if we are unable in the future to effectively reduce the
number of homes served by each node in our network, which should enable us to relieve local network capacity
constraints.

If we are not successful in launching VoIP by the third quarter of 2004 we will no longer be able to connect
new telephony subscribers in those areas served by Motorola modems. This supply shortfall would require us to incur
additional capital expenditure to grow our telephony business. In addition, if we are not successful in acquiring Canal+,
we would face further capital expenditure costs to provide digital television as it would necessitate a downstream
network upgrade.

For purposes of the foregoing discussion, we have excluded from capital expenditure the cost of the acquisition
of network user rights under the Clientele Agreements and Annuity Agreement and acquisitions of property and
equipment utilizing capital leases. See "—Contractual Obligations."

**_Available Liquidity_**

We maintain cash and cash equivalents to fund the day-to-day cash requirements of our business. We hold
cash primarily in euros. We held [€ 18.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December] 31, 2002, as compared
with [€53.7 million as of September] 30, 2003. Giving effect to the Refinancing, and [€40 million drawn under tranche C]-2
of the senior credit facility on November 3, 2003, we would have had [€ 163.7] million of cash and cash equivalents. See
"Description of Other Indebtedness."

Giving effect to the Refinancing, tranche D of the senior credit facility, which is a [€100] million undrawn
revolving credit facility, would be available to us subject to our being in compliance with certain financial covenants and
other conditions. See "Description of Other Indebtedness." In addition, giving effect to the Refinancing and the [€40]
million drawing under tranche C-2 of the senior credit facility on November 3, 2003, an additional [€40] million would be

83


-----

available under tranche C-2 of the facility for general corporate purposes, subject to such covenants and conditions.
The senior credit facility is discussed in greater detail in "Description of Other Indebtedness" and note 7 to our annual
financial statements.

The principal risks to our sources of liquidity are operational risks, including risks associated with decreased
pricing, reduced subscriber growth, increased marketing costs and other consequences of increasing competition, our
shortage of Motorola telephony modems and roll-out of VoIP and potentially adverse outcomes with respect to our
interconnection dispute that is currently the subject of litigation. See "Business—Legal Proceedings—Interconnection
Litigation." Our ability to service our debt (including payments on the Notes) and to fund our ongoing operations will
depend on our ability to generate cash. We have not made a profit since the Telenet group was formed in 1996 and
have a history of negative net cash flows after deducting interest and taxes. Although we expect to continue to report
losses in the foreseeable future, we anticipate generating positive cash flow after deducting interest and taxes, but
cannot assure you that this will be the case. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile—We may not
generate sufficient cash flow to fund our capital expenditures, ongoing operations and debt obligations, including our
obligations under the Notes."

The Issuer is a holding company with no source of operating income. It is therefore dependent on capital
raising abilities and dividend payments from subsidiaries to generate funds. The terms of the senior credit facility, our
other outstanding debt and the indenture governing the Notes contain a number of significant covenants that restrict our
ability, and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, pay dividends or make other distributions, make capital
expenditure and incur additional debt and grant guarantees. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Financial
Profile—The agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations that could adversely
affect our ability to operate our business and repay the Notes," "Description of Other Indebtedness" and "Description
of the Notes." Furthermore, the ability of the Issuer's subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to the
Issuer may be restricted by, among other things, other agreements and legal prohibitions on such payments.

We anticipate that the cash portion of our interest expense will increase substantially following the
Refinancing. See "—Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Other Income (Expense)." We believe that our cash
flow from operations and our existing cash resources, together with available borrowings under the senior credit
facility, will be sufficient to fund our currently anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service
requirements, although we cannot assure you that this will be the case.

In connection with the pending Canal+ Acquisition and our acquisition of Codenet, we have agreed to pay
combined purchase prices, including transaction expenses and integration costs, of approximately [€45] million, and
anticipate experiencing an additional [€10] million to [€15] million negative cash impact during the first two years following
completion of the acquisitions.

**_Contractual Obligations_**

(1) In connection with the HFC upgrade, we entered into the Clientele Agreements and Annuity Agreement. See "Our History—Network
Upgrade." Fees payable under these agreements, which we account for as long-term debt, include an interest and principal component.

84


-----

With respect to the principal component, we capitalize the present value of fees paid under the Clientele Agreements (over the first
20 years of the agreement in line with the life of the longest lived assets that form part of the HFC upgrade) as network user rights.
Likewise, we capitalize the present value of fees paid under the Annuity Agreement (which are due over periods of ten or 20 years) as
network user rights. We amortize network user rights over ten or 20 year periods. We account for payments of the interest component
under these agreements as interest expense. See "—Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Other Income (Expense)."

**_Contingent Liabilities and Commitments_**

For a discussion of our contingent liabilities and commitments, some of which are significant, see "Business—
Legal Proceedings," "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Financial Profile—We are contractually obligated to
commercially launch a digital television platform by March 2005, and our financial condition and cash flows may be
impaired by our efforts to launch digital television and any liability we incur if we fail to launch digital television" and
"Business—The Combined Network." See also note 14 to our annual financial statements. In connection with litigation
concerning the basis for our computation of copyright fees, as of September 30, 2003 we had accrued a liability of
approximately [€43.3] million. See "Business—Legal Proceedings."

**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**

Historically, we have not used special-purposes vehicles or similar financing arrangements. In addition, we do
not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements with any of our affiliates or with any unconsolidated entities.

**_Lack of Tax Consolidation_**

To the extent mismatches between taxable income and deductible expenses occur within the Telenet group,
our ability to generate cash flow could be adversely affected (because Belgian tax law does not provide for group-wide
consolidation). See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Financial Profile—We may not generate sufficient cash flow
to fund our capital expenditures, ongoing operations and debt obligations, including our obligations under the Notes."

**Critical Accounting Policies**

Our financial statements and the accompanying notes contain information that is pertinent to this discussion and
analysis of our financial position and results of operations. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities. Estimates are evaluated based on available information and experience. Actual results could differ from those
estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe that, in particular, the critical accounting policies and
estimates discussed below involve significant management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and
assumptions necessary in determining the related asset, liability, revenue and expense amounts. For a detailed
description of our significant accounting policies, see note 2 to our annual financial statements.

**_Property and Equipment_**

Property and equipment make up a significant portion of our total assets, as we have been investing significant
amounts for our network and other operating facilities during recent years. The annual depreciation charge depends
primarily on the estimated lives we allocate to each type of asset. Depreciable lives are as follows: buildings and
improvements: 33 years, operating facilities: 3-20 years and other equipment: 3-10 years.

Changes in asset lives can have a significant impact on our depreciation charge for the year. We regularly
review the depreciable lives and change them as necessary to reflect our current thinking on their remaining lives in
light of numerous assumptions and estimates, including with respect to technological change, prospective economic
utilization and physical condition of the assets concerned.

85


-----

**_Goodwill and Intangible Assets_**

In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS No. 142"),
we completed a transitional impairment test of goodwill in 2002 and performed an annual review for impairment during
the third quarter of 2003. Goodwill was computed based on one reporting unit.

Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flows using reasonable and appropriate assumptions that
are consistent with internal forecasts and based on management's best estimates and judgments. Upon implementation
of SFAS No. 142, we determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded the cumulative effect of a change in
accounting principle of [€667.6] million in 2002. Our earnings forecast was revised in 2003 mainly to reflect changes in
the Flemish markets for telephony and internet services. As a result, we recognized an impairment of [€336.0] million in
the third quarter of 2003 as a component of amortization of intangible assets in the accompanying statement of
operations. The tax impact recorded on these impairments is nil as a full valuation allowance is applied against all net
deferred tax assets.

We test on an annual basis reported goodwill for impairment by means of discounted cash flows based on
significant management estimates and judgments. The key variables which management must estimate in determining
expected future cash flows include subscriber and usage levels, prices, churn and penetration rates, operating and other
costs, capital expenditures and other factors, many of which are outside of their control. Such estimates are inherently
uncertain. Management periodically evaluates and updates the estimates based on the conditions that influence the
variables. If the goodwill is considered impaired, it is written down to fair value as appropriate. Different assumptions
regarding these internal forecasts could significantly affect our evaluations regarding goodwill impairment.

Apart from goodwill, we report the following finite-life intangible assets, which are stated at cost less
accumulated amortization, computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives: (i) network user
rights: ten to 20 years, (ii) customer lists: 15 years, (iii) trademarks: 15 years and (iv) software development costs: three
years (but not exceeding expected life). Estimating the useful lives of such assets involves a number of uncertainties
and assumptions, which are subject to change from time to time. Any such change can have a material effect on the
length of the estimated life and lead to impairment charges.

Network user rights relate to the Clientele Agreements and Annuity Agreement. In 1996, we entered into the
Clientele Agreements with the MICs and the PICs and into the Annuity Agreement with the PICs. We pay clientele
fees under the Clientele Agreements in return for access to the cable network customer database owned and
controlled by the MICs and PICs. The clientele fee is payable as long as we maintain usage rights to the cable
network. Such payments allow the MICs and the PICs to recover part of their historical HFC upgrade investment.

Considering this, the present value of the clientele fee payments over the first 20 years (being the life of the
longest lived assets that are part of the HFC upgrade) has been accounted for as network user rights under intangible
assets, and is amortized over ten or 20 years depending on the useful life of the underlying assets that make up the
HFC upgrade.

In connection with the MixtICS Acquisition, we acquired full control of the portion of the HFC upgrade
previously owned by the MICs. Consequently, from the MixtICS Acquisition onwards, network user rights only relate
to the access to the cable network of the PICs and the relating balance of the clientele fee payable reflects solely our
outstanding obligation to the PICs.

In accordance with the terms of the Annuity Agreement, the PICs charge us an annuity fee, which in
substance covers the remaining 60% of the cost of the HFC upgrade incurred by the PICs. Payments under the
Annuity Agreement are due over a period of ten or 20 years, depending on the useful life of the underlying assets that
make up the HFC upgrade incurred by the PICs. The present value of the future payments under the Annuity
Agreement has been capitalized as network user rights under intangible assets, and is amortized over ten or 20 years
depending on the useful life of the underlying assets that make up the HFC upgrade.

**_Warrants_**

Detachable warrants written in connection with debt issuance are accounted for under APB Opinion No. 14,
_Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants ("APB Opinion No. 14")._

86


-----

According to APB Opinion No. 14, the portion of the proceeds of debt securities issued with detachable stock
purchase warrants which is allocable to the warrants should be accounted for as paid-in capital. The allocation should
be based on the relative fair values of the two securities at time of issuance. Any resulting discount or premium on the
debt securities should be accounted for as such. We calculate the fair value of warrants issued using the Black Scholes
model, making certain assumptions on the fair value of the underlying shares, dividend yield, volatility and a risk free
rate of return. Such assumptions are inherently uncertain, and changes in the assumptions would impact the fair value
of warrants issued and ultimately the allocation of the proceeds of debt issued.

We account for freestanding warrants in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 0019, Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a Company's Own
_Stock as interpreted by EITF Issue No. 01-6, The Meaning of "Indexed to a Company's Own Stock." Accordingly,_
we assess whether these warrants are classified within shareholder's equity or as an asset or liability. Warrants
accounted for as permanent equity are recorded at their initial fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are not
recognized unless a change in the warrants classification occurs. Warrants not qualifying for permanent equity
accounting are recorded at fair value as an asset or liability with subsequent changes in fair value recognized through
the statement of operations.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

We account for the revenue, costs and expenses related to cable television, Internet and telephony services as
the related services are performed in accordance with SFAS No. 51, _Financial Reporting by Cable Television_
_Companies ("SFAS No. 51")._

Installation revenue for cable television, Internet and telephony services is recognized to the extent of direct
selling costs incurred. The remainder is deferred and amortized to income over the estimated average period that
subscribers are expected to remain connected to the system. Based on a review of historical data, the average
subscriber period for cable television customers is currently estimated as being 10 years. Direct selling costs have
exceeded installation revenue in all reported periods for internet and telephony services. As a result, installation
revenue was recognized as new subscribers were connected to the Combined Network.

In compliance with SFAS No. 51, we capitalize initial subscriber installation costs. These installation costs are
depreciated over a period no longer than the period used for the network. Installation costs relating to our broadband
Internet and telephony business are depreciated over a period of five years. Installation costs relating to the cable
television are depreciated over 20 years, which is in line with the depreciation of the cable television plant.

**_Financial Instruments_**

We account for derivative instruments in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, _Accounting for_
_Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS No. 133") and related interpretations and amendments._
SFAS No. 133 requires the recognition of derivatives on the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments
at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings, unless (i) the normal purchase or sale
exception or (ii) hedge, other than fair value hedges, accounting is elected. We determined that all derivative
instruments that we have used so far do not qualify for normal purchase and sale exception or hedge accounting, and
therefore all changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized as a gain or loss within the statement of
operations.

Moreover, SFAS No. 133 also requires certain embedded derivatives to be separated from the host contracts
and recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value. Specifically, if the economic
characteristics of an embedded derivative instrument and its host contract are not clearly and closely related, SFAS
No. 133 requires that the embedded derivative instrument be separated (bifurcated) and accounted for as a stand-alone
derivative instrument. We have determined that we have no embedded derivative instruments that are to be bifurcated
and measured at fair value.

**_Provisions for Litigations and Regulatory Proceedings and Other Contingencies and Commitments_**

We are involved in significant litigation and regulatory proceedings and have other material outstanding
contingencies and commitments. We assess on a periodic basis our liabilities in respect of such litigation and other

87


-----

contingencies and commitments, following the guidance set out in FAS No. 5, _Contingent Liabilities, and SOP 94-6,_
_Disclosure of Certain Significant Rules and Uncertainties. Determining the appropriate level of reserves or_
provisions requires management to make a number of significant judgments and estimates, including with respect the
degree of probability of an unfavourable outcome, the size and timing of such an outcome, the amount of potential loss
and any offsetting benefits. We have established a significant provision with respect to our outstanding copyright fee
litigation. We have not established any provisions or reserves for our other outstanding litigation, commitments and
contingencies, either because management believes they were not estimatable or were not probable. As new facts or
circumstances unfold, management will reassess the level of provisioning, and changes thereto may materially affect
our financial results and position.

**Recent Accounting Pronouncements**

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, _Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS_
No. 143"). SFAS No. 143 establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability at fair value
for an asset retirement obligation and an addition to the associated asset retirement cost. The accretion of interest
expense each period is subsequently recorded as an operating expense and added to the liability. SFAS No. 143 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. We adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003 and it had no
material impact on our results of operations and financial position.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, _Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,_
_Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections ("SFAS No. 145"). SFAS No. 145 rescinds_
SFAS No. 4, Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, which required all gains and losses from
extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income tax
effect. SFAS No. 145, which is effective in periods beginning after May 15, 2002, requires that gains or losses from
extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of APB Opinion No. 30. We
adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 145 on January 1, 2003, which had no material effect on our consolidated financial
statements.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, _Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal_
_Activities ("SFAS No. 146"). This statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit_
or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, _Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination_
_Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) ("EITF Issue_
No. 94-3"). SFAS No. 146 eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in EITF Issue
No. 94-3. SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized
when the liability is incurred. Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an
entity's commitment to an exit plan. Under SFAS No. 146, an entity's commitment to a plan, by itself, does not create a
present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability. SFAS No. 146 establishes that fair value is the
objective for initial measurement of the liability. SFAS No. 146 is effective for all exit or disposal activities initiated
after December 31, 2002. We adopted SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 had no
impact on our results of operations and financial position.

In November 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus related to _Revenue Arrangement with Multiple_
_Deliverables ("EITF Issue No. 00-21"). The consensus requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables_
should be divided into separate units of accounting if (i) a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone
basis, (ii) there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and (iii) if the arrangement
includes a general right of return, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and
substantially in the control of the vendor. Arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of
accounting based on their relative fair value and appropriate revenue recognition criteria would be applied to each
separate unit of accounting. The EITF agreed the effective date for the consensus will be for all revenue arrangements
entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003, with early adoption permitted. We are still evaluating the
impact of this EITF on our financial statements. This EITF will be effective for us for revenue arrangements entered
into after January 1, 2004.

In November 2002, the FASB issued interpretation No. 45, _Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure_
_Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others ("FIN No. 45"). FIN_
No. 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value, which is different from current practice, which is
generally to record a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. FIN No. 45 also requires a

88


-----

guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee
is remote. The disclosure provisions of FIN No. 45 were effective immediately in 2002. We are required to adopt the
recognition and measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 on a prospective basis with respect to guarantees issued or
modified after December 31, 2002. We do not believe the adoption of the recognition and measurement provisions of
FIN No. 45 will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. We adopted the initial recognition and
initial measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 on January 1, 2003 and it had no material impact on our results of
operations and financial positions.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, _Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,_
_Transition and Disclosure ("SFAS No. 148"). SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a_
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148
also requires that disclosures of the _pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based_
employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, SFAS No. 148 requires
disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ended after December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 148 are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. We adopted SFAS No. 148 in the
year ended December 31, 2002 and it had no material impact on our results of operations and financial position as we
continue to apply the provisions in APB Opinion No. 25.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, _Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN_
No. 46") which interprets Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) 51, _Consolidated Financial Statements ("ARB 51")._
FIN No. 46 clarifies the application of ARB 51 with respect to the consolidation of certain entities (variable interest
entities, or "VIEs") to which the usual condition for consolidation described in ARB 51 does not apply because the
controlling financial interest in VIEs may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests. In
addition, FIN No. 46 requires the primary beneficiary of VIEs and the holder of a significant variable interest in VIEs
to disclose certain information relating to their involvement with the VIEs. The provisions of FIN No. 46 apply
immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and to VIEs in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that
date. FIN No. 46 applies in the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2003, to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a
variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. We do not believe that the impact of the adoption of FIN
No. 46 will have a material effect on our financial statements.

In April 2003 the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of SFAS No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and
_Hedging Activities ("SFAS No. 149"). The statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments,_
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. In
particular, it (i) clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of a
derivative as discussed in SFAS No. 133, (ii) clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component, (iii) amends
the definition of an underlying to conform it to the language used in FIN No. 45 and (iv) amends certain other existing
pronouncements. Most of the provisions of SFAS No. 149 are effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003. We do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of
operations and financial position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, _Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with_
_Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity ("SFAS No. 150"). SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an_
issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. In accordance with SFAS No. 150, certain financial instruments that embody obligations of
the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise shall be effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 is not expected to have a material
impact on our financial condition or results of operations.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk**

We are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, primarily
as between the U.S. dollar and euro, and use financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and foreign
exchange rate fluctuations.

89


-----

_Interest Rate and Related Risk_

We are exposed to changes in interest rates because a large portion of our borrowings are variable rate debts.
See "Description of Other Indebtedness." Accordingly, our debt service obligations under such indebtedness fluctuate
as interest rates change. In order to mitigate this exposure, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements, caps
and best of cap/swap combination agreements. Pursuant to interest rate swap agreements, at specified intervals, we
pay a fixed interest rate and receive a variable interest rate calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional
principal amount. As of September 30, 2003, we had entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional principal
amount of [€380.9] million, and we paid fixed interest at a blended rate of 4.24%, resulting in additional cash interest
expense given the fact that such rate was in excess of the variable rate applicable to the respective borrowings. Caps
are used to limit our exposure to, and to derive benefits from, interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt within a
certain range of rates. As of September 30, 2003, we had entered into cap agreements for a notional principal amount
of [€560.7 million and an average cap interest rate of 4.1%. As of September 30, 2003, these cap agreements did not]
impact our cash interest expense. As of September 30, 2003 we had also entered into best of cap/swap combination
agreements for a notional principal amount of [€ 284.2 million and a pay interest rate ranging from 4.5% to 6.1%. The]
respective best of cap/swap combination agreements have not impacted our cash interest expense as of September 30,
2003. Interest rate risk management agreements are not held or issued for speculative or trading purposes. None of
these derivative instruments is a qualifying hedge for purposes of SFAS No. 133.

Historically, and after giving effect to the Refinancing, only borrowings under the senior credit facility and the
lease of the building bear interest at variable rates. We have entered into transactions to hedge our risk for the principal
amount of all such debt.

For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our
earnings or cash flows. We do not currently have any obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and,
accordingly, interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant effect on the fixed rate
debt until we would be required to refinance such debt. At September 30, 2003, we had outstanding fixed rate debt and
other obligations of [€574.8 million. On a ] _pro forma_ basis to reflect the Refinancing, at September 30, 2003 we would
have had outstanding fixed rate debt and other obligations of [€877.8] million.

Under the terms of our senior credit facility, we are required, among other things, to make gross up payments
to nonresident lenders for interest payments made under the facility that are subject to Belgian withholding tax.
Withholding taxation rates vary between 0 and 15% (the highest withholding rate currently applicable under Belgian
law) depending upon the tax country of residence of the relevant lender and whether that country is party to a double
taxation treaty with Belgium. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, we paid approximately [€2] million in such
gross up payments; for that period, only 32.2% of the aggregate interest payable under the terms of our senior credit
facility was held by nonresident lenders. If we had been required to make gross up payments on interest paid to all of
the lenders under our senior credit facility (which does not restrict transfers of interests in the facility to nonresidents of
Belgium) at the 15% withholding taxation rate, we would have had to make payments of approximately [€8] million for
the nine months ended September 30, 2003. On a pro forma basis to reflect the Refinancing and such payments at the
15% withholding taxation rate, we would have had to make payments of approximately [€7] million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2003.

_Foreign Currency Risk_

Our reporting currency is the euro. However, we conduct, and will continue to conduct, transactions in
currencies other than the euro, particularly the U.S. dollar. Approximately 6.2% of our costs of operations (primarily
the costs of network hardware and software equipment and management expenses under our strategic services
agreement with Cable Partners) for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 were denominated in U.S. dollars,
while all of our revenues were generated in euros. Decreases in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar would
increase the cost in euro of our U.S. dollar denominated costs and expenses, while increases in the value of the euro
relative to the U.S. dollar would have the reverse effect. As at September 30, 2003, the euro had appreciated
approximately 11.1% against the U.S. dollar since January 1, 2003.

We have historically hedged a portion of our U.S. dollar cash outflows arising on anticipated and committed
purchases through the use of foreign exchange derivative instruments. Although we take steps to protect ourselves
against the volatility of currency exchange rates, there is a residual risk that currency risks due to volatility in exchange

90


-----

rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Beginning in 2009,
Telenet Group Holding will be required to make cash interest payments in U.S. dollars on the Senior Discount Notes
and we will be required to make payments in U.S. dollars on a subordinated loan from Telenet Group Holding. We
intend to enter into hedging arrangements as necessary to mitigate our exposure to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/euro
exchange rate with respect to interest payments and repayments of principal upon maturity or earlier upon a
redemption. Our current intention is initially to hedge our exposure in respect of the accreted principal amount of the
Senior Discount Notes as at the fifth anniversary of their issuance and review at a later stage our hedging strategy with
respect to cash interest and principal payments payable after that date.

**BUSINESS**

**Overview**

We are the largest provider of broadband cable services in Belgium. Through our broadband network in
Flanders, we offer analog cable television, broadband Internet and telephony services, primarily to residential
subscribers.

      - **_Cable Television. Cable television is the principal medium for the provision of television services in_**
Flanders, and there is currently limited competition from satellite or terrestrial transmission of television
signals in Flanders or elsewhere in Belgium. Approximately 95% of television households in Belgium
are passed by a cable network. As of September 30, 2003, we had approximately 1.6 million
subscribers to our analog cable television service, representing a penetration rate of approximately
94% of the homes and businesses in Flanders passed by our network. As a result of our high
penetration, our cable television business has been stable and has provided us with a predictable source
of revenues and cash flow.

      - **_Broadband Internet. We are the leading provider of residential broadband Internet services in_**
Flanders. As of September 30, 2003, we had approximately 368,000 residential broadband Internet
subscribers, which contributed to our estimated market share of 53% in Flanders and to a penetration
rate of approximately 15.5%. We have grown from approximately 253,000 subscribers, which
contributed to a penetration rate of 10.6% as of September 30, 2002. Through our HFC-upgraded
network we offer our residential subscribers an "always on" high-speed broadband Internet service to
residential subscribers at downstream data transfer speeds of up to 4 megabits per second, which is
among the fastest speeds available to residential customers in western Europe. We believe that the
combination of the speed, stability and pricing of our Internet offering has enabled us to grow faster
than our competitors in Flanders.

      - **_Telephony. We offer our residential subscribers local, national and international long distance_**
telephony services as well as a variety of other related value-added services. As of September 30,
2003, we had approximately 241,000 residential subscribers, which contributed to an estimated market
share of 10% in Flanders (based on number of lines) and a penetration rate of 9.8%. These results
compared to approximately 221,000 residential subscribers as of September 30, 2002, which
contributed to a penetration rate of 9.1% as of September 30, 2002. We believe that we are currently
the largest competitor to Belgacom, the Belgian incumbent, in Flanders.

For the three months ended September 30, 2003, our residential analog cable, broadband Internet and telephony
services (including interconnection revenues relating to both residential and business customers) accounted for
approximately 39%, 30% and 24%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. In addition, we offer our business
customers a range of Internet, data and voice services, which accounted for approximately 7% of our consolidated
revenues for the three months ended September 30, 2003.

For the three months ended September 30, 2003, we generated annualized consolidated revenues and EBITDA
of [€506.8] million and [€252.8] million, respectively. See "Summary Financial Information and Operating Data."

Our broadband network passes approximately 1.7 million homes and businesses in Flanders. We are able to
offer cable television, broadband Internet and telephony services to subscribers whose homes are passed by our
network. In addition, we are also able to offer broadband Internet and telephony services to subscribers whose homes
are passed by the PICs Network, pursuant to 50-year usage rights, of which 43 years remain and which are
automatically renewable for successive 15-year periods unless terminated with ten years prior notice. The PICs
Network passes approximately 800,000 additional homes and businesses. Our network covers approximately 68% of
homes and businesses passed by the Combined Network in Flanders. We, in cooperation with our local municipal
partners, recently completed the upgrade of the Combined Network to the HFC standard that provides bi-directional
capability, enabling us to transmit and receive digital signals.

Our high performance optical fiber network extends over 10,000 kilometers and the coaxial local loops of the
Combined Network reach over 52,000 kilometers throughout Flanders. We use our network to transmit television

-----

signals and the Combined Network to carry telephony and Internet traffic to and from end users. We believe that we
have significant unutilized backbone capacity.

**Our Strengths**

      - **_High Penetration of Cable Television. Following an early introduction in the 1960s and 1970s, cable_**
television enjoys broad acceptance in Belgium. Approximately 95% of television households across
Belgium are passed by a cable network, compared to an average of approximately 43% of all
television households across the European Union. As of September 30, 2003, we provided cable
television to approximately 94% of the homes and businesses in Flanders passed by our network.
These high penetration rates have allowed our cable television business to generate relatively stable
and predictable cash flows. Our cable television revenues have been enhanced by recent increases in
the subscription fee charged to our subscribers. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Results of Operations—
Revenues—Cable Television" and "—Our Products and Services—Cable Television—Basic
Services."

      - **_Leader in Broadband Internet. We are the leading provider of residential broadband Internet_**
services in Flanders. As of September 30, 2003, we had approximately 368,000 residential subscribers,
which contributed to our estimated market share of 53% of all broadband Internet subscribers in
Flanders. During the three months ended September 30, 2003, we increased our market position by
adding more than 26,000 net new subscribers. We currently provide broadband Internet subscribers a
downstream data transfer speed of up to 4 megabits per second for a price of approximately [€42 per]
month (including VAT). We believe that the combination of speed, stability and pricing of our Internet
offering compares favorably to other broadband Internet products such as digital subscriber lines, or
"DSL."

      - **_Fully Built-out and Recently Upgraded Network. The Combined Network has an extensive reach_**
in Flanders, passing approximately 2.5 million, or 94%, of homes and businesses in Flanders. The
Combined Network includes our 10,000 kilometer high-capacity fiber backbone that spans Flanders.
This backbone is linked via head end stations and nodes to end users by local loops owned by us and
the PICs that consist of 52,000 kilometers of coaxial cable. The Combined Network has been
upgraded to an HFC standard capable of transmitting bi-directional digital data and offering a minimum
capacity of 450MHz.

      - **_Strong Brand Recognition. Telenet is a well-recognized brand in Flanders. Third-party research_**
commissioned by us indicates that consumers had over 95% aided brand awareness in 2003 of Telenet
as a provider of Internet and fixed telephony services, and unaided brand awareness that varied
between 60% and 80% depending on the level of Telenet's promotional activities. A third-party
customer survey that we paid for also indicated that customers recognize us for the quality of the
products we offer.

      - **_Strong Management Team. Our management team has extensive experience in managing_**
technology businesses in competitive markets. Management is supported by a diverse group of
shareholders, which bring a combination of international telecommunications experience and local
relationships to our operations. Our shareholders include 15 Flemish intercommunales that have
experience running local cable television networks, have strong local relationships and an
understanding of the Belgian regulatory environment.

**Our Strategy**

We seek to build on the existing reach of our cable television network and to increase the penetration rates of
our broadband Internet and telephony services. Our strategy is to continue to add value for our end users by providing
high quality products and superior levels of customer service. We aim to increase our operating cash flow by increasing
our customer base and the amount of revenue generated by each customer and by implementing cost-saving initiatives.
To achieve these objectives, we are pursuing the following strategies:

93


-----

      - **_Continue to Grow our Subscriber Base. We aim to maintain our strong presence in cable television_**
and continue to increase our subscriber base and expand our market share in broadband Internet and
telephony services. We are especially focused on the residential broadband Internet market, which
contributes incremental revenues while generating low incremental costs. We utilize a range of
promotions and brand marketing activities to attract new subscribers.

      - **_Prudent Deployment of Capital. We seek to make prudent capital expenditures and to deploy_**
proven technologies. The Combined Network has recently been upgraded to an HFC standard with bidirectional digital capability and passes approximately 2.5 million homes and businesses in Flanders.
We believe that the HFC upgrade and the reach of the Combined Network should limit the need for a
significant amount of capital expenditure for future upgrades. In addition, to reduce the risks frequently
associated with new product launches, we seek to invest in proven products and technologies. We aim
to use technologies that operate on "open standards" in order to increase the compatibility of various
network components. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditure."

      - **_Improve Cash Flow and EBITDA Margin. We seek to improve our cash flow and EBITDA_**
margin primarily by growing our subscriber base and maximizing the amount of revenue generated by
each subscriber. In addition, we continue to focus on reducing our operating costs. During 2002 we
increased our revenues while restricting the growth of our selling, general and administrative expenses.
We measure our EBITDA margin as revenues net of operating expenses (excluding depreciation and
amortization) and selling, general and administrative expenses taken as a percentage of gross
revenues. Our EBITDA margin increased from 18.3% for the nine months ended September 30, 2002,
to 46.6% for the nine months ended September 30, 2003. We have reduced the amount of our bad
debts, lowered network repair and maintenance expenses and controlled the growth of our workforce.
In the future, we plan to improve our EBITDA margin by lowering the cost of customer acquisitions
and customer service.

      - **_Continue to Focus on Quality and Customer Service. We view customer satisfaction as essential_**
to the maintenance of our existing subscriber base and pricing levels and our future prospects. We rely
on a number of metrics to evaluate the level of our customer service. One key factor is the average
time that our residential Internet and telephony subscribers wait to have their calls answered, which
was an average of approximately 30 seconds for the three months ended September 30, 2003. In order
to continue to reduce churn and enhance the quality of services we provide our subscribers, we have
customer retention teams that assist in the resolution of subscriber problems. We also intend to
introduce programs such as Telenet EasyCare™, which is a subscriber care computer program
designed to help subscribers find answers to certain common questions more quickly without having to
seek help from our call center. In addition, we regularly conduct customer surveys using internal and
third-party research organizations and continuously monitor competitor activity. We continuously invest
in product development to make our products and services more attractive. For example, we are in the
process of developing ExpressNet™, a high-speed broadband Internet product that we anticipate will
permit access to the Internet at speeds significantly faster than we currently offer.

**Our Products and Services**

We provide customers with video, data and voice services in Flanders. We offer our residential subscribers
cable television, broadband Internet and telephony services and our business customers broadband Internet, data and
voice services. We offer all of our products and services through our network, which covers approximately 68% of the
homes and businesses passed by the Combined Network in Flanders. We are able to offer broadband Internet and
telephony services to the remaining 32% of homes and businesses passed by the Combined Network in Flanders
through our 50-year right to use the PICs Network, of which 43 years remain and which are renewable for successive
15-year periods unless terminated with ten years prior notice.

Our residential subscribers include individuals and families living in homes and apartments as well as SoHos
that receive our services through a coaxial connection. Residential subscribers access our services from a node on our
fiber network that links via a coaxial connection to their home or business.

(1) Homes passed represents our estimate of the number of potential residential, SoHo and SME subscribers to
whom we can offer our services.

(2) Each subscriber is counted as a revenue generating unit, or "RGU," for each service subscribed. Thus, a
subscriber who receives from us cable television, broadband Internet and telephony services (regardless of
their number of telephony access lines) would be counted as three RGUs. RGUs are presented as at the
relevant period end date.

(3) Number of RGUs at the end of the relevant period as a percentage of the number of homes passed by our
network at the end of the relevant period. Penetration rate estimated where limited data available.

(4) Revenue earned for the period divided by the number of months in the period and divided by the average
number of RGUs for the period (which average number of RGUs may vary from the number of RGUs
presented above at the period end date). Includes copyright fees and revenue earned from carriage fees.

_Basic Services_

We are the largest provider of broadband cable services in Belgium. Analog cable television is the principal
means of television broadcasting in Belgium, with 95% of television households across Belgium passed by a cable
network. Currently, traditional terrestrial broadcasting and direct-to-home satellite broadcasting are not widely used in
Flanders or elsewhere in Belgium. We offer our 1.6 million subscribers between 32 and 35 television channels (some of
which are broadcast on the same network channel at different times), available through direct connections to
subscribers' televisions. We currently provide cable television to our subscribers in the form of a single, basic analog
package, with revenues derived from subscription fees and carriage fees paid by certain of the content providers to
carry their programs over our network.

We charge our cable television subscribers an average monthly fee of [€ 8.34, excluding VAT and copyright]
fees described below. Approximately 96% of our subscribers pay for their cable service in advance on an annual basis,
with the remainder paying on a monthly or quarterly basis pursuant to public welfare regulations. From 1994 until
December 2002, our subscribers paid an average monthly cable television subscription fee of [€6.67 (excluding VAT]
and copyright fees). Following approval from the Pricing Commission of the Belgian Ministry of Economic Affairs and
the Regional Programming Council, we raised our monthly cable television subscription fees by an average of 15% in
January 2003, to [€7.67 (excluding VAT and copyright fees) and by a further 10% of the original amount in July] 2003,
to the current [€8.34 (excluding VAT and copyright fees). In general, our cable television business has represented a]
stable source of revenue that has been enhanced by the recent price increases.

Together with subscription fees, cable television subscribers are charged an annual copyright fee for the
content received from public broadcasters that is broadcast over our network. We collect these fees on behalf of the
copyright collection agencies that act for holders of the relevant copyrights. In August 2003, these fees increased from
a monthly average of [€1.08 per month (excluding VAT) to a monthly average of €1.81 per month (excluding VAT) as]

95

a result of certain litigation with the copyright collection agencies over how copyright fees should be calculated. See
"—Legal Proceedings—Copyright Litigation." For a description of how we account for copyright fees, see
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors Affecting Results
of Operations—Revenues—Cable Television."

_Programming_

Our cable television programming varies depending on the location of the subscriber, with 32 channels available
to all of our subscribers and the availability of additional channels varying by region and regulatory minimum content
requirements. Channel offerings include local, national, foreign, sports and movie channels. We also offer our cable
television subscribers access to approximately 30 radio stations. We are required to deliver some of these television
channels and radio stations to our cable television subscribers pursuant to "must carry" rules. These requirements cover
broadcasts of the Flemish and French-speaking community broadcasters in Belgium and programs of authorized
broadcasters that are at least partly in the Dutch language. These rules currently apply to 15 of the television channels
that we transmit to any specific region of Flanders. See “Regulation—Broadcasting Regulation—Must Carry.”

The following chart lists the principal channels that we currently offer on our cable television network and
identifies those that we are required to carry pursuant to “must carry” regulations. We estimate that our cable
television viewers spend approximately 75% of their viewing time watching five Dutch language channels, of which
VTM, VT4 and Kanaal 2 are currently only available over cable networks.

 - Required to be carried on our television network pursuant to "must carry" regulations. Of the 15 "must carry" channels delivered to
any region, 11 are national channels, three are foreign channels and one is a regional channel.

Several different relationships govern the content that we provide our cable television subscribers. We pay

96


-----

copyright fees to the public national and regional broadcasters carried on our cable television network. We are required
by law to carry the signals of the regional broadcasters at no charge and also do not charge a carriage fee to the public
broadcasters. See "—Basic Services" and "Regulation—Broadcasting Regulation—Must Carry." We enter into
transportation and distribution agreements with the other commercial broadcasters, including those we are required to
transmit under "must carry" regulations. Through transportation contracts, we agree to carry a commercial
broadcaster's signal across our fiber backbone to our head end stations, where the signal is subsequently delivered to
either our subscribers or the cable television subscribers of the PICs. Broadcasters who transmit their signal to us by
satellite can elect to deliver their signal directly to our head end stations and, as a result, do not need to enter into a
transportation agreement with us. We also enter into distribution contracts with all of the commercial broadcasters
whose channels we carry on our network, pursuant to which we agree to carry the broadcaster's signal from the head
end station to our cable television subscribers. We base the prices that we charge under distribution contracts on
nondiscriminatory policies.

In some situations, we do not charge the broadcasters any fee for transmitting their signal to our subscribers
and we do not pay any content fees. Instead, the broadcasters benefit from increased advertising revenues they
receive from reaching our cable television subscribers and we benefit from providing our subscribers added content. In
limited situations, we pay broadcasters for the channels they transmit over our network. In addition to these
arrangements, we have also entered into contracts with certain broadcasters pursuant to which we currently pay a fee
in order to have the right to broadcast their signal on any digital cable television service that we may offer in the future.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, we paid copyright fees of approximately [€20.3] million to public national
and regional broadcasters and related copyright agencies. For that same period, we received net payments of
approximately [€600,000 under our transportation and distribution arrangements (excluding our relationship with the]
Canal+ group).

_Premium Services_

Cable television subscribers in Belgium are able to subscribe for premium movie, sports and other channels
directly from the Canal+ group, which provides both digital and analog programming to our subscribers through a
proprietary set top box. Subscribers can pay to receive single showings of sporting events and recently released films,
and can also receive premium channel packages. The Canal+ group provides digital and analog services to
approximately 102,000 of our cable subscribers and analog services to approximately 44,000 subscribers of the PICs
through a contractual arrangement with us and the PICs that grants the Canal+ group the exclusive use of nine 8 MHz
television channels on our network and three 8 MHz channels on the PICs Network. We are currently involved in a
dispute with the Canal+ group regarding the termination of this arrangement. See "—Legal Proceedings—Canal+
Litigation."

We have entered into an agreement to acquire all of the Flemish assets and subscribers of the Canal+ group
(the "Canal+ Acquisition"), which will allow us to offer the premium television services currently provided by the
Canal+ group directly to our cable television subscribers as well as those of the PICs. We intend to complete the
Canal+ Acquisition at the end of December 2003, with financial effect from December 1, 2003. The Belgian
competition authority (Raad voor de Mededinging) has approved the acquisition, subject to certain conditions. These
conditions require us, among other things, to:

      - grant other premium television service providers access to our network on commercially reasonable
terms, taking into account, among other things, the available capacity on our network;

      - offer the Canal+ premium service to other television network operators who want access to its
content, and charge end users on our network and such other networks a uniform, nondiscriminatory
price for all end users;

      - not enter into contracts with broadcasters that make us the exclusive distributor of their signal and
waive any exclusivity provisions that are currently in force within 30 days of the authority's decision;

      - not invoice Canal+ subscribers served by other service providers under the "Telenet" name and not
deliver any Telenet publicity with such invoices; we must list all service providers who provide Canal+
in any Telenet advertising for Canal+; and

97


-----

      - provide the Belgian competition authority an annual compliance report and obtain approval of the
competition authority for any sale or assignment of the content rights that we acquire from Canal+.

The decision of the Belgian competition authority is subject to an appeal within 30 days from publication of the
decision in the Belgian Official Gazette (Belgisch Staatsblad). Our acquisition of the Canal+ Assets is also subject to
a number of conditions to closing, including the sale to other parties of the Canal+ business in the French-speaking
region of Belgium and the consent of the movie studios and other programming suppliers that provide content to
Canal+. Completing the acquisition should better enable us to introduce a digital offering by gaining access to certain
Canal+ employees with digital expertise, acquiring certain digital equipment, securing access to premium content and
giving us control over the nine television channels on our network currently used by the Canal+ group. We also expect
to develop a direct customer relationship with the Canal+ subscribers using the PICs Network, paying the PICs a fee
to transmit the Canal+ premium content through their network. In the long-term, we do not anticipate directly holding
the rights to the content that we expect to acquire in the Canal+ Acquisition. If we are not able to complete the Canal+
Acquisition it may be more difficult to introduce a digital offering. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Business—Conditions imposed on the Canal+ Acquisition, a failure to complete the Canal+ Acquisition or the inability
to ensure sufficient access to premium programming could have an adverse effect on our operating results."

**_Residential Broadband Internet_**

We offer "always on" high-speed broadband Internet services to residential subscribers throughout Flanders
over the Combined Network. Using cable modems to connect subscribers to the Combined Network, our current
residential offering allows end users to receive data from the Internet at a "downstream" data transfer speed of up to 4
megabits per second.

We believe that a combination of speed, stability and pricing enabled us to gain an estimated 53% share of the
Flemish broadband Internet market as of September 30, 2003. Broadband Internet services have reached high levels of
acceptance in Flanders using a broadband connection. This trend may be attributed to the relatively high ratio of speed
to price of residential broadband Internet service in Flanders when compared to that available in most other markets in
Europe. Our ability to continue to grow this market, however, will depend in part on increases in the number of
households in Flanders. We estimate that 49% of households in Flanders contain a personal computer, which lags
behind the rest of western Europe, based on third party surveys and internal estimates of recent trends.

The following chart sets forth certain information related to our residential broadband Internet service as of
and for the periods indicated:

We offer our subscribers five installation alternatives when they subscribe for Internet access from us: the
"Self-Install" plan, where the Telenet installer installs only the cable Internet modem; the "Self-Install Plus" plan, where
the Telenet installer also provides required cables; the "Comfort Install" plan, where cables are not supplied but the
Telenet installer also configures the subscriber's personal computer; and the "Comfort Plus Install" plan, where the
Telenet installer addresses all aspects of the installation so that the subscriber is ready to use the Internet immediately
after the installation is completed. We have recently begun to offer wireless ("Wi-Fi") installations, enabling our
residential subscribers to limit the amount of wiring required in their homes and to enjoy the flexibility of broadband
wireless Internet access.

Our most popular Internet offering is the "Mono" Package, which connects a single personal computer to the
Internet. The specific features of our Mono Package as currently offered, including available optional features, are

**_Residential Telephony_**

We offer our residential subscribers throughout Flanders local, national and international long distance
telephony services together with a variety of related value-added services. The residential telephony market is
dominated by Belgacom, the successor to the former monopoly provider of telecommunications services in Belgium.
As of September 30, 2003, we estimate that, based on total active telephone lines, Belgacom had an estimated 80%
share of the fixed-line telecommunications market in Flanders. As of that same date, we had an estimated market
share of 10% in Flanders, representing 212,000 direct access subscribers and 29,300 carrier preselect subscribers. Our
direct access telephony subscribers are directly linked to the Combined Network and we earn revenues from
subscription and usage fees generated by these subscribers. Many of our carrier preselect subscribers can only receive
telephony service through the Belgacom network because we have not yet installed equipment in our head end stations
serving their areas that would allow them to receive telephony service directly from us. Through our carrier
preselection service, we offer subscribers telephony service using Belgacom's telephone network and earn usage
revenues generated by these subscribers.

At present, we offer residential subscribers the only direct access alternative to Belgacom in Flanders. We
believe sales of our residential broadband Internet services have been a significant factor driving telephony sales. As of
September 30, 2003, approximately 30% of unique subscribers subscribed to both our telephony and broadband Internet
services.

(1) Homes passed represents the estimated number of potential residential, SoHo and SME subscribers to whom we can offer our
telephony services via a coaxial connection or a carrier preselect service.

(2) Each subscriber is counted as a revenue generating unit, or "RGU," for each service subscribed. Thus, a subscriber who receives from us
cable television, broadband Internet and residential telephony services (regardless of its number of telephony access lines) would be
counted as three RGUs. RGUs are presented as of the relevant period end date. Telephony RGUs include direct access and carrier
preselect subscribers.

(3) Number of RGUs at the end of the relevant period as a percentage of the homes passed by the Combined Network as of September 30,

(4) Revenue earned for the period divided by the number of months in the period and divided by the average number of RGUs for the
period (which average number may vary from the number of RGUs presented at the period end date). Excludes interconnection revenue
and installation fees but includes revenue generated by RGUs who use our carrier preselection services.

(5) Total number of RGUs disconnected during the period divided by the average number of RGUs for the period, multiplied by (four

thirds in the case of information presented for the nine months ended September 30, 2002 and September 30, 2003). Excludes RGUs
who use our carrier preselection services and includes SMEs that receive our services through a coaxial connection. We exclude RGUs
who use our carrier preselection services from our residential telephony churn statistics because, for the most part, these customers
subscribe to our direct access telephony services upon ceasing to subscribe to our carrier preselection services.

Our direct access residential telephony subscribers are charged a fixed monthly fee for their telephone line and
all of our residential telephony subscribers are charged a variable fee based on usage. Discounted usage charges apply
when calls are placed to another Telenet subscriber. We seek to price our residential telephony products to provide a
better value alternative to Belgacom. The following table sets out our basic fixed-line and per minute telephony tariffs
effective for new subscribers joining Telenet as of December 1, 2003:

**Monthly line rental fee (including VAT):[(1)]  16.80**

(3) Defined as 7 p.m. to 8 a.m. each weekday and all day for weekends (except for connections to mobile telephone lines) and public
holidays except for Base, for which off-peak times are defined as 10 p.m. to 10 a.m. each weekday and public holidays.

(4) All day during the weekend.

(5) Outgoing calls incur a set-up fee for each telephone call originating on the Combined Network.

Currently, subscribers are not charged an installation fee to receive residential telephony services.

For an additional fee residential subscribers may receive enhanced telephony features, which include packages
of features and individual services such as voicemail and caller ID. The following table lists the prices for subscribing
for some of the additional telephony features that we offer as of December 1, 2003:


**Additional Feature**
**Package/Service** **Services**


**Monthly Charge**
**(including VAT)**


Top Line
(Top-lijn™) ........... Caller ID, voicemail, call forwarding and call waiting €5.00

Youth Line
(Jong-lijn™).......... Separate phone number, monthly calling budget and 3-way calling €4.92

Additional features .. Caller ID, voicemail, call forwarding and call waiting €2.46 each

Our subscribers currently receive residential telephony services through modems that operate on proprietary
technologies. By the fourth quarter of 2004, however, we plan to launch VoIP technology on the Combined Network,

101


-----

which will enable us to offer telephony services to our subscribers through an open standards EuroDOCSIS modem
that we expect will be substantially less expensive than the telephony modems we currently use. See "—Future
Products and Services—VoIP." VoIP should enable us to move away from our reliance on proprietary technology,
which we expect will help us alleviate a shortage of Motorola telephony modems. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to
Our Business—The Combined Network and systems depend on equipment and service suppliers that may discontinue
their products or seek to charge us prices that are not competitive, either of which may adversely affect our business
and profitability."

_Interconnection_

Network operators, including us, charge interconnection termination fees to terminate telephone calls on their
network that originated from a user on another network. Typically, the cost of interconnection fees that we pay is
taken into account in the price we charge our subscribers. Interconnection fees that we receive to terminate calls
originating domestically are higher than for calls originating from outside of Belgium and charges for interconnecting to
a mobile network are substantially higher than charges for interconnecting to another fixed-line network. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2003, we incurred interconnection fees of approximately [€25.8] million and received
interconnection revenue of approximately [€19.2] million. Our interconnection practices are subject to comprehensive
regulation by the Belgium Institute for Post and Telecommunications (Belgisch Instituut voor Postdiensten en
_Telecommunicaties), or "BIPT." See "Regulation—Telephony Regulation—Interconnection." In August 2002, we_
increased the rates we charge for inbound domestic calls that terminate on the Combined Network from an average of
€0.009 per minute to an average of €0.0475 per minute. This price increase is the subject of legal challenges by
Belgacom. Interconnection termination rates for inbound international calls remain at [€0.009 per minute. See "]—Legal
Proceedings—Interconnection Litigation" and "Risk Factors—Litigation Risks—We are currently involved in a
significant dispute with Belgacom relating to the price we charge competitors to interconnect to our telephony network,
and an unfavorable outcome for us in this dispute would reduce the profitability of our telephony business."

Our principal interconnection agreements are with Belgacom and its mobile telephone subsidiary Proximus.
Belgacom provides telephony services to an estimated 80% of the Flemish market and the majority of the
interconnection fees that we pay are to Belgacom. A provisional interconnection agreement governs our relationship
with Belgacom. Pursuant to the terms of this agreement, we agree to terminate calls to users on our respective
networks. Belgacom charges us its standard tariffs for these services, which is an average of [€0.009 per minute.]
Although the agreement provides for us to charge the same rates charged by Belgacom, we charge higher rates to
terminate domestic calls on the Combined Network pursuant to certain decisions of the BIPT. See "—Legal
Proceedings—Interconnection Litigation." Pursuant to rulings of the BIPT, we pay an estimated amount of
interconnection termination fees to Belgacom at the beginning of each month. Any differences as a result of actual
usage during the month are reconciled after the close of each period. The terms of this agreement expired on
December 31, 1998, but we have extended it since then pursuant to letter agreements on a three-month rolling basis.
Our current extension of the agreement expires on February 29, 2004. Our agreement with Proximus has similar
advance-invoicing procedures and can be terminated on eight-months advance notice.

In July 2003, we entered into an interconnection agreement with Mobistar in order to reduce the average
interconnection and transit charges we incur when routing calls from the Combined Network across Belgacom's
network to mobile operators in Belgium. The agreement also includes a clause that expressly prohibits tromboning and
renews annually unless at least eight months prior notice is given by either party. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to
Our Business—The Belgian Internet, data and telephony industries are highly competitive and the television industry
may become more competitive in the future, which could result in lower prices and the loss of subscribers."

We also have agreements with MCI and Colt that govern interconnection termination rates for international
calls that originate on the Combined Network.

**_Sales, Marketing and Customer Care_**

We currently market our Internet and telephony services under the "Telenet" brand name, which we support
with extensive advertising and brand awareness campaigns. We plan to migrate our cable television operations
currently using the MixtICS name to the Telenet brand name by the second quarter of 2004. If we complete the
Canal+ Acquisition, we plan to market our newly acquired premium cable television services under a joint
Telenet-Canal+ brand and to transition these services over a period of time to the Telenet brand, to the extent

102


-----

consistent with requirements of the Belgian competition authority. See "—Cable Television—Premium Services." We
believe that our analog cable television service is viewed as a utility service and therefore have not actively marketed
it.

Our residential sales and marketing division manages all aspects of subscriber acquisition, installation and
retention on a unified basis for our cable television, broadband Internet and telephony businesses. We manage our
marketing and promotional activities, sales channels and customer care initiatives to increase the degree of subscriber
penetration and increase the levels of services purchased by our subscribers. We use a combination of individual
promotions and general brand marketing to attract and retain subscribers in our broadband Internet and telephony
businesses. Our marketing expenses include fixed costs, commissions paid to generate sales and subscriber incentives
that can include free installation and reduced subscription costs. Post-installation, we engage third parties to conduct
frequent surveys to ensure that subscribers are satisfied with us and our products, and engage in programs to minimize
voluntary churn, such as "win-back" promotions to persuade subscribers requesting to disconnect their service to
change their decision.

Sales and marketing channels for Internet and telephony services include media advertising, telemarketing, emarketing, door-to-door marketing and targeted mail solicitation. We make direct sales through our customer call
center at our head office in Mechelen. In addition to our call center, our agents, who are paid a commission based on
the number of sales closed, also provide a significant source of sales. These agents include retail outlets and dealers
and, for broadband Internet services, consumer electronics and other retailers that sign customers up at the store for a
one year Internet service subscription. In addition, door-to-door marketing of one-year telephony contracts by both our
employees and third-party marketing agencies has proven especially effective for telephony sales. Telenet employees
in our door-to-door sales force receive a base salary and an additional commission for each telephony contract sold.
We pay only commission, and not any fixed salary, to third-party door-to-door sales agents based on the number of
telephony contracts sold by the agencies. We continuously evaluate our marketing channels to allocate our resources
most efficiently.

Customer care is a significant priority of our management, and is based out of our customer call center in
Mechelen. For the three months ended September 30, 2003, we were able to answer calls to our customer call center
within an average wait of approximately 30 seconds. We plan to introduce new programs such as Telenet EasyCare™
to provide improved customer support on a more cost-efficient basis.

We use a customized information technology platform to manage subscriber records from the point of sale,
monitor product installation on a real-time basis and track and respond to subscriber queries. We have recently
upgraded our customer service platform to provide our call center agents with, among other things, individual subscriber
payment information and the ability to download network status data. In addition, all of our installers use proprietary
GPRS laptop computers to stay in touch with the head office when they are conducting subscriber installations. This
system should increase the efficiency of our installation staff by allowing them to re-arrange appointments more quickly
when faced with a cancellation or other changed circumstances.

**_Business Services_**

Our business customers include small and medium size enterprises ("SME") with between five and 100
employees, larger corporations and public, healthcare and educational institutions, and carrier customers that include
international voice, data and Internet service providers. Current corporate customers include AGFA, DHL, Concentra
Media and KBC Bank NV. Our corporate customers generally connect to our network directly through a fiber optic
connection and our SME customers connect to the Combined Network through a coaxial or fiber connection,
depending on the scope of their needs. We only target those business customers that are sufficiently close to our fiber
backbone or the relevant coaxial network to provide services on a competitive basis while at the same time meeting
cost recovery and future return thresholds. In addition to adding new customers, we focus on selling our existing
corporate customers additional products and services.

Our offerings include Internet, data and voice products that provide varying levels of service depending on the
needs of the customer—ranging from residential type products for SMEs that require Internet access and professional
support, to iFiber, Managed Data and Voice and other customized services for companies requiring very high
capacities, integrated voice and data solutions and redundant systems. We also offer managed leased lines that connect
two endpoints and are reserved for a customer's sole usage, in addition to hosting facilities, toll-free marketing numbers

103


-----

and Internet protocol based services. We offer our carrier customers leased lines, unused fiber on our network and
access to our local loop (which is described below under "—The Combined Network") which they use to provide
services to their customers in Flanders. We are able to offer our corporate customers voice services over their fiber
connections to our network, but are currently limited in the voice products we can offer our SME customers over a
coaxial connection. We expect to expand the voice services that we offer our SME customers, however, through the
planned introduction of VoIP technology, which will enable us to introduce an Integrated Services Digital Network, or
"ISDN," service.

We have dedicated sales and marketing teams for most of our large business customers and use a combined
regional and sector based approach to corporate and institutional account management, and more traditional direct sales
and door-to-door techniques to reach the SME segment. Prices that we offer our corporate, public, healthcare,
educational and carrier customers are usually negotiated on a case-by-case basis whereas standardized prices more
typically apply to our SME customers.

_Codenet Acquisition_

We believe that our acquisition of Codenet will expand our operations to a scale that should enable us to
compete more effectively in the business markets. Historically, we have only been able to provide broadband Internet,
data and voice services in Flanders to our SME, corporate and carrier preselection clients. The Codenet acquisition
expands our fiber backbone network to include all of Belgium and parts of Luxembourg, allowing us to offer our
customers nationwide connectivity, which is important to companies operating on a national level. In acquiring Codenet,
we expect to gain access to employees who have valuable experience in the business markets, enabling us to adopt a
marketing and sales approach better-suited to serving business customers than our prior model, which was derived
from our experience in the residential markets. We expect that Codenet's expanded network should also allow us to
reach a broader section of the SME market, a market in which our future growth was limited because we only offer
services to those SMEs that are close to a Telenet coaxial connection. Codenet's product offering, which is particularly
strong in the data service segment, will also complement our product offering, which emphasizes voice products.
Codenet's asynchronous transfer mode, or "ATM," network, for example, currently offers frame relay services, which
businesses commonly use as a secure means of data transport. We initially plan to market our business services under
a joint brand name. The acquisition of Codenet has been approved by the Belgian competition authorities, which
approval is subject to an appeal. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Our pending acquisition of the
Canal+ Assets and our acquisition of Codenet pose significant challenges, and difficulties integrating either acquisition
may adversely affect our operating results."

**Future Products and Services**

We aim to adopt new technologies only after appropriate standards have been successfully implemented on a
commercial scale. This approach increases the likelihood that the cost of necessary equipment will decline over time
and reduces compatibility and supply risks. Among the products that we plan to introduce in the future are the delivery
of telephony services using VoIP and interactive digital television ("iDTV"). Telenet has also announced its intention to
launch ExpressNet™, a broadband Internet product that will offer subscribers significantly faster upstream and
downstream speeds. Investments being made in the upstream upgrade and the phasing in of EuroDOCSIS 2.0 modems
may enable these capabilities.

**_VoIP_**

We anticipate implementing VoIP telephony by the fourth quarter of 2004. VoIP telephony works by
compressing voice signals into discrete packets in digital form that are then transmitted over Internet protocol networks,
thereby allowing the use of software rather than hardware switching. The deployment of VoIP would help address our
current shortage of Motorola telephony modems, although problems may arise that interfere with our planned roll-out.
See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The Combined Network and systems depend on equipment and
service suppliers that may discontinue their products or seek to charge us prices that are not competitive, either of
which may adversely affect our business and profitability." In addition to providing residential telephony capabilities,
VoIP will allow us to introduce an ISDN service for our SME customers. VoIP offers the potential for significant cost
savings because it can be offered using significantly less expensive telephony modems than those we currently use and
it gives us the ability to install, where appropriate, a single modem for both Internet and telephony service. These VoIP
modems operate on an open standard EuroDOCSIS platform that is not linked to the proprietary technology of any

104


-----

single manufacturer. We have waited to launch a VoIP offering until there has been sufficient commercial deployment
of the technology by other telephony operators to provide us with a certain level of comfort that the technology is
viable, which we believe has now been achieved. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business—If we fail to
successfully introduce new technologies or services, such as VoIP telephony, or to respond to technological
developments, our business and level of revenues may be adversely affected."

**_Interactive Digital Television_**

We are developing a plan to offer iDTV to our cable television subscribers. Digital technology compresses
video signals into a smaller amount of space than is currently taken by analog channels. Some of the premium services
currently offered by the Canal+ group, which we plan to acquire, are transmitted in digital format. We intend to develop
a broader digital offering, however, that will provide our subscribers interactive features not currently available on
analog television or the Canal+ group's service. These interactive offerings may include video on demand and the
ability to view a sporting event from multiple angles, send e-mail, use short message services ("SMS") and access
government services and programs. We anticipate that our iDTV subscribers would be able to access a variety of
content, services and value added features (including video on demand and pay-per-view television), for a monthly or
usage-based fee that will vary according to service.

We are currently participating in a joint project with the Flemish government, Interkabel and broadcast
channels VMMa, VRT and VT4 to develop such an iDTV offering based on the Multimedia Home Platform, or
"MHP," standard, which has been adopted as a common standard by numerous hardware manufacturers and is
currently being tested by several cable operators. In the future, we would like to expand the joint development project
to include regional broadcasters. We were awarded a matching grant from the Flemish government, which is funding
small-scale trials that began in September 2003. We plan to launch an iDTV offering when we believe that market
conditions will support such an offering in a cost-effective manner and we have resolved technological, content and
operational issues to our satisfaction, consistent with our strategy of only deploying proven technology. See "—Our
Strategy—Prudent Deployment of Capital." We also will not be able to launch iDTV until we have received the
necessary consents from the lenders under our senior credit facility for the expenditures and the change in our business
plan required for the introduction of iDTV. We are exploring the possibility of using retail set top boxes and other
methods to reduce the level of capital expenditure. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditure." As part of the MixtICS
Acquisition, we have agreed with the MICs to launch a digital television offering by March 2005. See "Risk Factors—
Risks Relating to Our Financial Profile—We are contractually obligated to commercially launch a digital television
platform by March 2005, and our financial condition and cash flows may be impaired by our efforts to launch digital
television and any liability we incur if we fail to launch digital television."

**Supply and Installation**

We have relationships with several suppliers that provide us with hardware and software necessary to operate
the Combined Network. All of our Internet modems are supplied by Motorola. Under a framework agreement with
Motorola, we have designated Motorola as our preferred supplier of high-speed data modems and related head end
equipment until March 29, 2006, provided that the products Motorola supplies continue to be competitive based on an
overall combination of quality, availability, pricing, technical specifications, integration and support services and other
supply terms. We have agreed to purchase from Motorola on an annual basis at least 30%, and over the term of the
framework agreement at least 50%, of our requirements for modems (including VoIP modems) and any set top boxes
required for iDTV. We cannot use digital set top boxes from any other vendor until at least six months after we have
deployed Motorola's boxes. We have also agreed to exclusively deploy Motorola's proprietary conditional access
system, which provides encryption and access control functions for our network. Motorola has agreed to license this
technology to two other suppliers so that they can provide us with competing products. See "Certain Relationships and
Related Transactions." Until Motorola ceased production, we also received the majority of our telephony modems from
Motorola. We are now faced with a shortage of Motorola telephony modems, which could affect the growth of our
residential telephony business.

We have also entered into maintenance agreements with Motorola to provide necessary maintenance on
Motorola head end equipment. We also have supply and maintenance relationships with other entities, such as Terayon,
which is a supplier of telephony modems and head end equipment, and Nortel Networks Corp., from whom we
purchased our telephone switches and who now provides us with maintenance services. Other significant suppliers

105


-----

include Alcatel, which provides equipment necessary for our Internet protocol backbone and to transport our telephony
traffic, and Telindus, which has provided additional equipment manufactured by Cisco Systems, Inc, for our Internet
protocol backbone.

We currently use six different subcontractors to install Internet and telephony equipment in subscriber homes,
in addition to performing a small portion of installations with our employees. Our agreements require that the
subcontractors maintain certain quality levels and use trained personnel, and we monitor the efficiency and quality of
service provided by the subcontractors on a regular basis.

Infosys Technologies Limited provides our group with information technology ("IT") services. Pursuant to a
framework agreement that we entered with Infosys in March 2001, Infosys designed our customized IT platform that
manages our subscriber records and continues to provide us IT maintenance and other design and support services.
See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The Combined Network and systems depend on equipment and
service suppliers that may discontinue their products or seek to charge us prices that are not competitive, either of
which may adversely affect our business and profitability."

**Billing**

Since we acquired the cable television assets of the MICs, we have billed our cable television services
indirectly as part of local municipal electricity bills issued by Electrabel. We intend to bill these services directly, under
the MixtICS name, beginning in January 2004. We aim to complete in December 2003 the migration of our cable
television subscribers to the same billing system used for our broadband Internet and data and telephony subscribers.
See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We may experience difficulties and higher costs as we complete
the integration of our recently acquired cable television business into our operations." By the second quarter of 2004,
we plan to begin issuing cable television bills under the Telenet name. We collect approximately 96% of our analog
cable television subscriptions on an annual basis in advance. Subscribers receive their annual bill in different months of
the year. We bill the remainder of our cable television subscribers in advance on a monthly or quarterly basis, as
required by public welfare regulations. Each month we recognize a _pro rata portion of our annual cable television_
subscription fees as revenue.

We bill basic telephony voice services and broadband Internet services in advance and telephony usage in
arrears. All of our Internet and telephony subscribers receive monthly billing statements that set out summary details on
combined fixed charges and, for telephony, itemize per-usage charges for calls to mobile telephones and international
locations. Approximately one-half of our subscribers pay by means of direct debit, which is an option open to all
subscribers. In the second half of 2004, we may introduce an e-billing system where we would send subscribers their
bill over the Internet.

**The Combined Network**

Our network consists of a fiber backbone with local loop connections consisting of coaxial cable with a
minimum capacity of 450MHz, which provides us with 48 usable downstream channels, of which 34 are used for
analog cable television, nine are used by the Canal+ group and five are used for Internet and telephony transmissions.
The network consists of approximately 10,000 kilometers of fiber optic cable in addition to approximately 52,000
kilometers of coaxial cable that is part of the Combined Network. Fiber optic cable uses glass fibers to transmit signals
over long distances with minimal signal loss or distortion. It has good broadband frequency characteristics, noise
immunity and physical durability and can carry hundreds of video, data and voice channels over extended distances.
The deployment of coaxial cable is less expensive but requires more extensive signal amplification in order to obtain the
desired transmission levels for delivering channels.

Transmissions of our broadband Internet and telephony signals begin on our primary fiber optic ring. They are
then directed by a series of routers (and, in the case of telephony, by telephone switches) to secondary fiber optic rings
that connect the 47 head end stations that we use. These head end stations are where our fiber optic backbone joins
our HFC network. From the head end stations, signals travel over another series of fiber optic rings until arriving at one
of our 2,255 nodes. On average, approximately 1,100 homes are served by each node. The portion of the network
starting at the head end and terminating at the end user is referred to as the HFC access network on the "local loop."
Amplifiers are used on the coaxial lines to amplify both downstream and return path signals. We provide broadband
Internet and telephony services to approximately 32% of the homes and businesses passed by the Combined Network

106


-----

that are not directly served by our network through a 50-year right to use the PICs' local loop. The PICs Network uses
a local network architecture similar to that employed in our network, but a majority of the PICs Network has been
upgraded to provide a minimum capacity of 600 MHz. Our usage rights grant us access to 40 MHz of downstream
capacity and 10 MHz of upstream capacity on the PICs Network. See "—Our Usage Rights on the PICs Network."

Many of our business customers elect to connect directly to our fiber optic network by linking through a point
of presence to the fiber optic rings located between our head end stations and nodes.

Cable television, broadband Internet and telephony signals enter the premises of our subscribers who connect
to the Combined Network over a coaxial connection through a wall socket. In the case of cable television, subscribers
can attach an appropriate cable from their television set directly to the wall socket. For other services, such as
broadband Internet or telephony, signals pass through a network interface unit, or "NIU." The NIU separates the signal
for use by an Internet modem or telephony modem, as appropriate. Our Internet modems communicate with the head
end stations using the EuroDOCSIS protocol, which is a defined interface specification that allows various network
components to communicate with each other and which has been adopted as a common standard by numerous
hardware manufacturers. Our telephony modems currently communicate with our head end stations using proprietary
software that is unique to the manufacturer of the modem—for example, Motorola telephony modems can only
communicate with Motorola head end equipment and Terayon telephony modems can only communicate with Terayon
head end equipment. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The Combined Network and systems
depend on equipment and service suppliers that may discontinue their products or seek to charge us prices that are not
competitive, either of which may adversely affect our business and profitability."

Our network operating center in Mechelen monitors performance levels on the Combined Network on a
continuous basis to detect immediately any outages or network irregularities. We have a separate disaster recovery
site, and our network has been designed to include redundant features to minimize the risk of network outages, with the
fiber optic rings designed to reroute traffic in the opposite direction around the ring in the event that a section of the
ring is cut. We also plan to install additional equipment in our head end stations to increase the redundancy of our
systems. The performance management team analyzes the Combined Network as a whole and determines where
expansions and upgrades may be required to accommodate increased traffic levels. We have insured our fiber optic
cable, buildings, head end stations, nodes and related network equipment against fire, floods, earthquakes and other
natural disasters. We do not carry insurance on any of our coaxial network. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Business—Failure to maintain and upgrade the Combined Network or make other network improvements, or the
occurrence of events that result in damage to the Combined Network, could have a material adverse effect on our
operations and impair our financial condition."

**_HFC Upgrade_**

The Combined Network was recently upgraded to an HFC standard that provides bi-directional digital
transmission capabilities. Work on the upgrade started in 1996 and was substantially completed by June 2002. Prior to
the upgrade, we provided dial-up Internet and telephony service through a carrier preselect service. As regions were
upgraded to an HFC standard, we migrated these subscribers to direct broadband Internet and telephony service. We
were also able to perform maintenance on our head end stations and nodes as part of the upgrade process.

**_Our Usage Rights on the PICs Network_**

We have access to the PICs Network through an agreement between Interkabel, which is owned by the PICs,
among other entities, and Telenet Vlaanderen. In connection with the creation of Telenet Operaties in 1995 and
Telenet Vlaanderen in 1996, the PICs, through Interkabel, granted Telenet Vlaanderen usage rights to their cable
networks in return for shares in Telenet Vlaanderen (which have since been exchanged for shares of Telenet Group
Holding) (the "Interkabel Contribution Deed"). In turn, Telenet Vlaanderen licensed these rights to Telenet Operaties.
The PICs granted the usage rights for a term of 50 years, of which 43 years remain. The usage rights automatically
renew for consecutive terms of 15 years unless terminated with ten years notice. The usage rights, and the call option
described below, are secured by a [€3.7] million mortgage on Interkabel's co-ownership interest in the PICs. There is no
rental charge payable to the PICs for the usage rights, although on an ongoing basis we are required to make payments
to the PICs under the Annuity Agreement and Interkabel Clientele Agreement. See "Our History—Network
Upgrade."

107


-----

Under the Interkabel Contribution Deed, our group has access to 40 MHz downstream and 10 MHz upstream
capacity on the PICs Network. We have the exclusive right to provide point-to-point communication and are able to
provide certain pay per view, near video on demand and multimedia services on the PICs Network on a nonexclusive
basis. The PICs retain the right to offer DTV.

The Interkabel Contribution Deed obligated the PICs to carry out the HFC upgrade to the PICs Network,
which was pre-financed in full by the PICs. Pursuant to the Clientele Agreements, we agreed to reimburse a total of
40% of this upgrade cost for the PICs in exchange for access to their cable network customer database. This
obligation will continue for as long as our usage rights under the Clientele Agreements exist. As part of the Interkabel
Contribution Deed, we also agreed to pay the PICs an annuity fee that effectively covers the remaining 60% of the
cost of the HFC upgrade incurred by the PICs. Payments under the Annuity Agreement are due over a period of ten
or 20 years, depending on the useful life of the underlying assets that make up the HFC upgrade on the PICs Network.
Our outstanding obligations under the Clientele Agreements and the Annuity Agreement equaled approximately
€92.2 million as of September 30, 2003. See "Description of Other Indebtedness."

Under the shareholders' agreement among the principal shareholders of Telenet Group Holding, the principal
companies of our group have agreed to bear the maintenance and operating costs attributable to our use of the PICs
Network, and Interkabel and the PICs agree to bear the costs associated with the PICs Network before the HFC
upgrade. In addition, the principal companies of our group have agreed that if the cable subscriber penetration rate for
the PICs Network falls by 12.5% or more from the levels existing on January 1, 2001, as a result of increased
competition from digital satellite television or other factors impacting the evolution of television distribution, they will
agree to bear a portion of the maintenance costs paid by the PICs based on parameters to be agreed by the parties.

Telenet Vlaanderen has pre-emptive rights, with certain exceptions, with respect to any proposed transfer by
Interkabel of its co-ownership interests in the PICs, or transfers by the PICs of shares in Interkabel, at the price
offered by a third-party. Interkabel and the PICs have agreed not to dissolve voluntarily the co-ownership structure
without the consent of Telenet Vlaanderen. Interkabel has also granted to Telenet Vlaanderen a call option on its coownership interests in the PICs, at the lower of book value or fair market value, in the event of a breach of its
obligations or the obligations of the PICs under the Interkabel Contribution Deed.

Under the terms of the Interkabel Contribution Deed, the usage rights will automatically terminate if, among
other things, (i) there is a unanimous and definitive decision of the board of Telenet Holding to cease any direct or
indirect development, installation or exploitation of our telecommunications network in Belgium, (ii) either Telenet
Holding, Telenet Vlaanderen or Telenet Operaties is declared bankrupt or put into liquidation, (iii) certain provisions of
the constitutive documents (Statuten) of Telenet Vlaanderen are amended in any way that is detrimental to the rights
of Interkabel without Interkabel's written consent, (iv) the director of Telenet Vlaanderen nominated by Interkabel is
dismissed for any reason without Interkabel's written consent and such director is not replaced by another director
nominated by Interkabel, or (v) Telenet Vlaanderen ceases to be an affiliate of Telenet Operaties.

**_Planned Network Investments_**

Our fiber backbone currently runs several protocols, including Internet protocol ("IP") for broadband Internet
access; the Synchronous Digital Hierarchy, or "SDH," protocol, which operates our telephony network and a video
protocol used for our analog cable transmissions. With the introduction of VoIP and other technology using the IP
standard, we expect over time that IP will carry an increasing proportion of our communications traffic, which should
allow us to increase the efficiency of the Combined Network. During the first half of 2004, we plan to install the
necessary hardware and related equipment in the Combined Network to allow us to deploy VoIP and our
ExpressNet™ higher speed broadband Internet product across the Combined Network. The upgrade is scheduled to be
completed during the second or third quarter of 2004. During the second quarter of 2004, we plan to begin upgrading
the upstream capacity of our coaxial network, which should enable us to maintain our performance targets for our
products and services and simplify our residential installation. This upgrade will increase our upstream capacity
bandwidth from the 5-25 MHz range to the 5-65 MHz range and is scheduled to be completed by the first half of 2006.
See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital
Resources—Capital Expenditure."

We regularly extend our coaxial network to serve newly constructed dwellings in Flanders. We expect to
spend approximately [€12] million during the current year to extend our local loop.

-----

**Competition**

We face varying degrees of competition from established and new competitors in Flanders and the rest of
Belgium. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The Belgian Internet, data and telephony industries are
highly competitive and the television industry may become more competitive in the future, which could result in lower
prices and the loss of subscribers."

**_Cable Television_**

Our cable television service in Flanders does not currently compete with other television and video services on
a significant scale. Although our cable television licenses are not exclusive for the territories that we serve, the only
direct competition we face is in the city of Leuven, where UPC offers a competing cable television service. Leuven
accounts for approximately 28,000 of the 1.7 million homes passed by our network. Unlike in many other countries,
traditional broadcast television stations that provide free programming that can be received using a roof-top antenna are
not a significant source of competition due to the low price, early rollout and wide availability of cable television service
in Belgium and the clearer picture and wider variety of programming that cable television provides.

With the exception of the current premium television offering of the Canal+ group, digital broadcasting
systems, including direct-to-home satellite program distributors, video streaming and compression technologies and
digital terrestrial broadcasting, have not been deployed on a commercial scale in Belgium to date. It is likely, however,
that these digital broadcasting systems will be offered on a broader basis in Belgium in the future, as they have been in
other European countries. For example, in the future we believe it is likely that Belgacom will introduce a streaming
video on demand product over its established telephone network.

We believe that our extensive cable network and the broad acceptance of cable television in Belgium will help
us compete effectively in the television market. See "—Our Strengths—High Penetration of Cable Television." We are
able to offer international, national, regional and local content, including Flemish language broadcasts, to our
subscribers. We believe satellite and other providers would have difficulty providing this content in a cost-effective way
because of the relatively small size of the Flemish market and their limited ability to carry local broadcasting. Currently,
two of the most popular broadcast channels in Flanders, VTM and VT4, only transmit their signal over cable networks.
We also believe that subscribers prefer the convenience of plugging in to our cable network over purchasing and
installing satellite dishes or other types of antennae, which would be required to receive the broadcasts of many of our
potential competitors.

**_Broadband Internet_**

Competition in the provision of residential Internet service focuses on speed and price, among other factors.
The relatively high margins available in the Belgian Internet market may attract additional competitors into the market,
leading to a higher level of price-based competition. Our residential broadband Internet service in Flanders currently
competes with:

      - dial-up Internet services that provide a connection to the Internet over a fixed telephone line; and

      - DSL, which allows connections to the Internet at speeds several times greater than analog modems
over conventional telephone lines.

Future competitors to our Internet offerings may include wireless ("Wi-Fi") networks and improved mobile
telephone technologies, such as third generation ("3G") mobile technology. Wi-Fi technology permits users to have a
high-speed wireless connection to the Internet in certain public places and their homes and 3G and related technologies
allow users to access Internet-type content over their mobile telephones.

We are planning to launch a very high-speed ExpressNet™ broadband Internet service following the upstream
upgrade of our network and the introduction of EuroDOCSIS 2.0 modems to new subscribers. The product will
significantly increase both upstream and downstream speeds available to subscribers.

109


-----

_Dial-up Services_

Prices for dial-up services generally are substantially lower than our broadband service, and can even be
offered to the consumer for free, although per-minute usage charges are applicable to all telephone calls in Belgium.
These services, however, are much slower than those we offer, often at speeds of no more than 56 to 128 kilobits per
second for standard residential users, compared to our standard offering of up to four megabits per second. In addition,
our service offers an "always on" connection that does not require the use of a telephone line to connect to the
Internet. We believe that these attributes distinguish us from the lower-cost dial-up services.

_DSL Services_

DSL services use existing copper wires to offer faster connections to the Internet than dial-up services, and
therefore more directly compete with our broadband Internet over cable service. Current DSL technology deployed in
Belgium offers Internet connections of up to 3 megabits per second on a "best efforts" basis. In addition, DSL
connections are generally offered at a lower subscription price than our service and are marketed as a "plug & play"
product that allows subscribers to purchase and install themselves the equipment required to establish a DSL Internet
connection, obviating the need to schedule an installation appointment. Belgium has recently seen the introduction of
new competition from "light" DSL Internet services that were launched in December 2003. These services, which have
already been introduced in other European countries, offer connectivity at slower speeds in exchange for substantially
lower prices than we charge for the service that we currently offer. If effective, these "light" services could negatively
affect our sales and churn (as well as the sales and churn of our competitors) and create greater price competition in
the Belgian market.

Belgacom, our primary competitor in providing Internet services, employs DSL technology and is able to
market its service to users of its fixed-line telecommunication services. Other providers of DSL services purchase
access to Belgacom's local loop and resell that access to their DSL subscribers. We believe that the higher speed of
our service compared to that offered by DSL provides a competitive advantage.

**_Telephony_**

Competition in the provision of residential fixed telephony services is based on price, in addition to customer
service, brand recognition, functionality and quality of service. Our principal competitors include:

      - other operators of fixed-line services, including those that own their networks and those that employ
carrier preselection and other services; and

      - mobile telephone operators.

_Fixed-line Operators_

The residential fixed telephony market in Belgium is dominated by Belgacom. As of September 30, 2003,
Belgacom had an estimated 80% market share of the fixed-line telecommunications market in Flanders. Belgacom is
majority-owned by the Belgian government, with the remaining shares held by a consortium of other investors that
includes experienced telecommunications providers from the United States and elsewhere. Belgacom has an
established market presence, a fully built-out network and resources that are substantially greater than ours.

Despite Belgacom's dominance, new competitors are also entering the market, including Tele 2, which offers a
carrier preselection service. See "—Our Products and Services—Residential Telephony." These entrants often have
substantial resources and experience from conducting telephony operations elsewhere in Europe.

We primarily compete with Belgacom by seeking to offer our residential subscribers telecommunication
services at lower prices on some services than those available from Belgacom. Belgacom, however, recently
announced the planned merger of its retail and wholesale divisions, which we believe may lead to lower retail prices.
The use of carrier preselection services and number portability has helped us market our telephony products, but has
also benefited our other competitors in the telecommunications market. More generally, we believe that the extensive
Combined Network and the other services we provide in Flanders are assets in the residential telephony markets.
Subscribers can have one point of contact for their telephony, Internet and, where available, cable television services.

110


-----

In addition, other service providers (except Belgacom), do not have their own local loop, which means that they must
pay other operators (typically Belgacom) for access to an existing network so that they can reach their own
subscribers. This disadvantage may dissipate, however, as the unbundling of the Belgacom local loop progresses and
competitors gain more open access to the Belgacom local loop. Moreover, if the Belgian authorities determine under
the New Framework that "wholesale broadband access" is a relevant market in which we have significant market
power, we may be required to grant others access to our network, including our local loop. See "Regulation—The New
Framework."

_Mobile Service Providers_

In addition to competing with fixed-line operators, we also compete with mobile service providers as users,
especially in the residential market, increasingly substitute fixed lines for mobile telecommunication services. See
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Four Most Recent
Quarters." As mobile technology improves with 3G and other products, this source of competition is expected to
increase. Belgacom has a strong presence in this market, through its subsidiary which operates under the name
Proximus. Other mobile telephone competitors include Mobistar and Base. We believe that our prices for fixed-line
services, our focus on customer service and our ability to offer both broadband Internet and telephony services to our
subscribers are assets in addressing competition from mobile service providers.

**_Business Services_**

Competition in the provision of Internet, data and voice products to business customers is more intense than in
residential markets. In this market, we compete not only with Belgacom, but with major players in the international
markets including Colt, MCI, Versatel and BT. We have been limited in competing in the business markets because the
Combined Network does not reach outside of Flanders, and many large businesses expect to have a single
communications provider for all of Belgium, or even all of Europe. We believe that our acquisition of Codenet will help
remedy this deficiency in Belgium, providing us with a network presence through the fiber optic cable that Codenet
leases from Belgacom and Electrabel and the network equipment it owns throughout Belgium and parts of
Luxembourg. The acquisition should also increase our market share and allow us to offer a wider array of business
services to our customers on a national level. Through Codenet's employees, we expect to gain valuable knowledge of
the Belgian business markets.

**Intellectual Property**

Our group does not possess any material patents or copyrights, nor do we believe that patents play a material
role in our business. We have registered several trademarks with the Benelux Trade Register Office (Benelux
_Merkenbureau) including our brand name, logo and service offerings. Pursuant to the pending acquisition of the_
Flemish assets of Canal+, we expect to obtain an exclusive, non-transferable license to use the Canal+ name in
Flanders for a limited period of time in connection with our provision of premium cable television services.

(1) Electrabel employees who provide services for MixtICS pursuant to a services and transfer agreement.

As of September 30, 2003, we had an average of 1,123 full-time employees, including approximately 400
employees that are provided by Electrabel pursuant to our services agreement with Electrabel, in addition to 51
temporary employees. In April 2002, we reduced our work force by approximately 100 employees as part of our costreduction program. We expect employment to increase in the future in line with subscriber growth. In addition, we
expect the number of our employees to increase by approximately 115 in connection with the Codenet acquisition and
by approximately 120 in connection with the pending Canal+ Acquisition.

Two employee works councils, the Telenet Works Council (Ondernemingsraad Telenet) and the ICS Works
Council (Ondernemingsraad ICS), represent the non-management employees for the Telenet group (other than
MixtICS) and MixtICS, respectively. The ICS Works Council has up to 16 members and the Telenet Works Council
has up to eight members (although two seats are currently vacant). We plan to merge the two works councils when we
assume direct responsibility for the employees of MixtICS. See "—Electrabel Employees." We also expect to form a
four-member works council for PayTVCo if it acquires the Canal+ Assets. We meet with the works councils on a
monthly basis to discuss a wide range of issues. By law, the works councils must approve certain decisions that we
make related to working conditions, including for example work hours, and must be consulted on terminations of over
30 employees.

In addition to the works councils, our employees are represented by local chapters of two national unions: the
Christian Trade Union (Algemeen Christelijk Vakverbond) and the Socialist Trade Union (Algemeen Belgisch
_Vakverbond). Our collective bargaining agreements with these unions are valid for an indefinite period subject to six-_
months' notice of changes. We also plan to enter into collective bargaining agreements with local chapters of these
same national unions with respect to the Electrabel employees who will be transferred to us under the services
agreement we have with Electrabel. See "—Electrabel Employees."

We provide our employees with health and life insurance benefits, as well as a defined contribution pension
plan. In addition to state requirements, we offer private medical care, income to cover extended sickness and life
insurance.

We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.

**_Electrabel Employees_**

In connection with the MixtICS acquisition, we entered the Services and Transfer Agreement with Electrabel.
Pursuant to this agreement, Electrabel agreed to provide operational services, including cable installation, maintenance
and call center services, with the related employee base scheduled to be transferred to us during the first quarter of
2004, although we may seek to extend the transfer date to the start of the second quarter of 2004 based on operational
considerations. Pursuant to this agreement, we direct the activities of these employees and compensate Electrabel for
the cost of their services, but Electrabel continues to pay the employee salaries. For the nine months ended
September 30, 2003, we paid Electrabel approximately [€26.9] million for employee services under this agreement.

Upon expiration of the Services and Transfer Agreement, we have agreed to employ the Electrabel personnel
(other than those providing call center, legal and information technology services) on the same terms and conditions
pursuant to which they were employed by Electrabel, which is on a higher average pay and benefits base than our
current employees because of their higher average age and pay structure. Transferred employees will maintain their
current defined benefit pension plan and health and life insurance benefits. We currently anticipate that approximately
400 employees will be transferred to MixtICS under the agreement. We will not assume any liabilities, claims or
demands related to periods prior to the date of transfer. Electrabel will make any pension payments for transferred
employees arising prior to the transfer date. Although the agreement is scheduled to end as early as February 9, 2004,
we may seek to extend the transfer date to the start of the second quarter of 2004. Prior to the transfer of the
Electrabel employees to our payroll, Electrabel must give notice to its unions confirming that we paid to Electrabel and
the MICs, the deferred consideration for the MixtICS Acquisition and the HFC upgrade (we expect to make this
payment as part of the Refinancing).

**Properties**

We lease our headquarters building pursuant to a sale-leaseback arrangement with KBC Bank NV ("KBC"),
which is the security agent and a lender under our senior credit facility. The lease expires on December 31, 2014.
Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we have an option to purchase all rights relating to the land and building from
KBC at the end of the lease. We in turn have granted our shareholder Callahan Investco Belgium 1 S.à R.L. a similar
option, which would allow it to purchase all such rights on the same terms and conditions as our option from KBC. We
retain the right to rent the building from Callahan Investco Belgium 1 S.à R.L. on arm's-length terms until the expiration
of all surface rights.

Our fiber and coaxial network runs through public and private rights of way. Article 99 of the 1991 Law (see
"Regulation—Telephony Regulation—Overview") grants us free rights of way on public land. Approximately 95% of
our rights of way are over public land, and we pay a relatively small amount of taxes to Flanders in connection with
these public rights of way. With the introduction of the New Framework, it is possible that additional taxes could be
imposed on these public rights of way by local municipalities. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Regulatory and
Legislative Matters—Pending legislation may significantly alter the regulatory regime applicable to us, which could
adversely affect our competitive position and profitability." The 1991 Law also grants us a right to run our network lines
over private land provided that we pay the owner of the land fair compensation. Disputes concerning the amount of
compensation to be paid for private rights of way are resolved by the BIPT. In general, our fiber optic cable runs in
trenches shared with utilities and other service providers and our coaxial cable runs in trenches to which we alone have
access. Approximately 40% of our local loop is above ground. We pay approximately [€2.3] million a year to Electrabel
to rent space on their utility poles to bring coaxial cable connections to many subscriber homes.

Pursuant to our services agreement with Electrabel, we currently use portions of Electrabel warehouses,
workshops, operations buildings and customer service offices which were used by the MICs in their provision of cable
television service prior to the MixtICS Acquisition. For the nine months ended September 30, 2003, we paid Electrabel
approximately [€ 27,000 for access to these facilities. We also rent four fibers of Electrabel's fiber optic backbone to]
provide cable television services, for an annual rent of approximately [€2] million.

The buildings housing our switches and head end stations are a vital part of our network. We own two switch
buildings, and have ownership rights (opstalrechten) in two further switch buildings until June 30, 2046 and
December 31, 2046, respectively. One of these switch buildings is located on land owned by a MIC and the other is
located on land owned by a PIC. We also have usage rights with respect to one other switch building for a period of 30
years, which is owned by Electrabel. We paid an average annual rent of approximately [€25,700 for our usage rights of]
each switch station as of September 30, 2003. Some head end stations are located in stand-alone structures and others
are parts of larger utility and similar complexes. We own 22 of our head end stations and lease an additional 4 stations
from Electrabel and 19 from several of the PICs. Two head end stations are part of switch stations in which we have
usage or ownership rights. Our leases with Electrabel and the PICs expire on September 22, 2046. As of
September 30, 2003, we paid an average annual rent of [€ 27,900 for each head end station that we lease.]

**Environmental Matters**

Our operations are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to land use and environmental
protection. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable requirements. Although land on which two
of our head-end stations are located is known to be contaminated as the result of historical operations, the landlords
have assumed responsibility for any current or future cleanup and we do not believe we have any obligations or
liabilities in these matters.

**Legal Proceedings**

We are involved in a number of legal proceedings that have arisen in the ordinary course of our business. We
discuss below certain pending lawsuits in which we are involved. Other than as discussed below, we do not expect the
legal proceedings in which we are involved or with which we have been threatened to have a material adverse effect
on our business or consolidated financial position. We note, however, that the outcome of legal proceedings can be
extremely difficult to predict with certainty, and we offer no assurances in this regard.

**_Copyright Litigation_**

113


-----

All Belgian cable television operators pay fees to copyright collection agencies and broadcasters for the
content that they distribute to end users on their network. The Belgian Radio and Television Distributors association
(Beroepsvereniging voor Radio- en Televisiedistributie) (the "RTD") represents us and all of the other cable
television operators in Belgium with respect to these copyright fees. In September 1995, the Belgian Society of
Authors, Composers and Publishers ("SABAM"), a copyright collection agency terminated its existing copyright
contract with RTD with effect from January 1, 1996, and sought to increase the copyright fees payable by all of the
cable companies operating in Belgium. The other copyright agencies and broadcasters followed SABAM's lead, with
disputes focusing on whether copyright charges under the new contracts should be based on actual viewer ratings for
specific programs and reflect increased competitive forces, as we, through RTD, advocated, or should instead be based
on the number of potential viewers and increased to reflect inflation and higher production costs, as the agencies and
broadcasters argued. These disputes resulted in extensive litigation for six years. Pursuant to a court order, during this
litigation we, through RTD, paid the copyright agencies and broadcasters 70% of the amounts agreed to be paid under
the copyright contracts in force in 1995.

The most significant of these disputes have been with three groups: SABAM; the Association of International
Collective Management of Audiovisual Works (Association de Gestion Internationale Collective des Oeuvres
_Audiovisuelles) ("AGICOA"), the copyright collection agency for the film studios; and the group of foreign public_
broadcasters. We estimate that fees paid to these entities represented approximately 16%, 35% and 39%, respectively,
of the total amount of copyright fees that we paid to the agencies and broadcasters in 1995. We also have been in
litigation with smaller agencies and broadcasters. As of September 30, 2003 we had accrued a liability in connection
with copyright litigation of approximately [€43.3] million. See "Risk Factors—Litigation Risks—Failure to settle existing
copyright claims of certain broadcasters and copyright collection agencies may have a material adverse effect on our
cash flow and financial condition."

_Settlements with SABAM and AGICOA_

In November 2002, RTD reached a settlement with AGICOA pursuant to which we paid [€17.5] million
(excluding VAT) to cover additional copyright fees for the period from January 1, 1996 to December 31, 2002, and
agreed to pay a fee based on a per program price and the number of our subscribers. For the 2003 fiscal year, we
expect to pay approximately [€5.6] million in fees under this agreement. The agreement expires on December 31, 2005,
but is subject to automatic one-year renewals. On May 28, 2003, RTD reached a settlement in our suit with SABAM,
pursuant to which the Belgian cable television operators agreed to settle claims for past amounts owed and for an
increased copyright fee going forward, which is calculated based on the number of subscribers to our cable television
service. As part of the settlement, RTD entered into a copyright agreement that expires on December 31, 2007.

_Suit with the Foreign Public Broadcasters and Ongoing Settlement Negotiations_

In February 2003, the commercial court of Brussels (Rechtbank van Koophandel) issued a ruling in the suit
between RTD and the foreign public broadcasters, holding that for the period from 1996 to 2001 the foreign public
broadcasters were entitled to the full amount of the copyright fees agreed to for 1995, increased for inflation at a rate
of 5% for 1996 and 2% each year from 1997-2001. The full amount of the judgment, for which we have joint and
several liability, is approximately [€47.7] million. Our liability for the judgment, if the other members of the RTD pay their
proportional share, is estimated to be [€21.6] million for the period from 1996 to 2001 with an additional [€3.8] million due
for fiscal year 2002. RTD has appealed the court's decision and also entered into settlement negotiations. We may
have to pay the full amount of the judgment, approximately [€47.7] million, if RTD's appeal is not successful, RTD is not
able to settle and the other members of RTD do not pay their proportional share. Interest on outstanding amounts owed
under the judgment will be payable from June 1, 2002 at the legal interest rate, which is currently 7%. This amount
likely would have to be paid in a lump sum. Although we have provisioned our proportional share of the outstanding
copyright litigation, an adverse outcome would have a significant negative impact on our cash flow compared to the
cash flow we may expect if we are successful in appealing the commercial court ruling in favor of the foreign public
broadcasters. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Factors
Affecting Results of Operations—Revenues—Cable Television."

In addition, we increased the copyright fee we charge our subscribers in August 2003 because of the court
ruling regarding the foreign public broadcasters and the agreements we expect to enter with the other copyright
agencies and broadcasters. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of

114


-----

Operations—Factors Affecting Results of Operations—Revenues—Cable Television" and "—Our Products and
Services—Cable Television—Basic Services." On July 29, 2003 we notified the Ministry of Economic Affairs of this
increase, as required by Belgian law. The amounts that we expect to pay as a result of these settlements and new
agreements have been provisioned for in our financial statements. See note 11 to our interim financial statements. If
we are required to make a lump sum payment of the judgment in favor of the foreign public broadcasters, however, we
would not be able to immediately offset the amount of the required payment against the increased copyright fees that
we are now charging our cable television subscribers to gradually make up the amount that we owe for prior periods.

**_Interconnection Litigation_**

We have been involved in regulatory and court proceedings with Belgacom related to the increased
interconnection fees that we began charging telephone operators to terminate calls made to end users on the Combined
Network in August 2002. See "—Our Products and Services—Residential Telephony—Interconnection." Traditionally,
interconnection fees between fixed line telephony operators had been charged on a reciprocal basis—the
interconnection termination rates that Belgacom charged us were the same as the interconnection termination rates we
charged Belgacom. This fee arrangement made it difficult for us to provide telephony services at a profitable level,
however, because we did not have the benefit of scale to be able to achieve the same unit cost as Belgacom. As a
result of our different cost structure and because of a continued high rate of fees charged for fixed-to-mobile
interconnection (where the reciprocity principle is not applied), we requested permission from the BIPT to increase our
domestic and international interconnection rates. In June 2002, the BIPT ruled that we could increase our average
interconnection rates for all inbound calls from [€0.009 to €0.0475 per minute. In August] 2002, however, the BIPT
amended this decision by ruling that the increase would not apply to inbound international calls. We began charging
increased interconnection termination rates for inbound domestic calls on August 13, 2002. On August 12, 2002,
Belgacom increased the tariffs that it charges its telephony subscribers calling Telenet numbers to reflect our increased
termination rates.

_Challenges by Belgacom_

Belgacom challenged our increased interconnection termination rates for inbound domestic calls before the
commercial court of Mechelen (Rechtbank van Koophandel) on the grounds that our termination rate increase
represented abusive pricing. The commercial court heard arguments in the case on September 23, 2003, and a ruling is
expected during the fourth quarter of 2003. The court may defer to the price determination made by the BIPT as the
primary regulator of the telecommunications industry in Belgium, in which case we would be able to continue to charge
our current interconnection termination rates. Alternatively, the court may decide to review the merits of the
termination rate increase, in which case it may affirm the termination rate increase, determine that the termination rate
is abnormally high and require that it be reduced or, less likely, decide that the [€0.009 tariff be reinstated. If the court]
determines that our termination rates are abnormally high, we would expect to be required to reduce the average
domestic interconnection termination rate we charge to an amount below [€0.0475. The specific amount that we would]
charge would depend on several factors, including any limits outlined by the court, our network costs and other factors.
Depending on the court's decision, Belgacom may be able to challenge the reduced termination rates, which could lead
to additional litigation before the commercial court. We believe that we were able to justify the higher interconnection
termination rate that was accepted by the BIPT, and would therefore expect in the ordinary course to appeal any
decision of the commercial court that would suggest that we should reduce our interconnection termination rates. Any
final decision on such an appeal, however, would depend on the specific holding of the court and the related facts and
circumstances surrounding the case at that time.

Belgacom has also challenged the BIPT's June 2002 approval of our increased domestic interconnection
termination rates before the Council of State (Raad van State), the highest administrative court in Belgium. The
council may affirm the BIPT's decision or return the case to the BIPT for reconsideration. On July 3, 2002, the Council
of State rejected an emergency request from Belgacom to suspend the implementation of the increased interconnection
termination rate. We do not expect a decision from the Council of State on the merits of the case before 2005.

A decision reducing the interconnection termination rates that we can charge could have a material adverse
effect on our telephony business. Although we do not consider such an outcome probable, we estimate that if the
commercial courts or BIPT were to require us to charge the original average interconnection rate of [€0.009, our annual]
revenues from interconnection termination in 2003 would be reduced by approximately [€ 20] million. We do not think it
is likely that either the commercial court or the BIPT would require us to repay amounts that we have received under

115


-----

the higher interconnection termination rates prior to any ruling requiring us to reduce our rates because of the difficulty
that Belgacom would have in demonstrating that it suffered any harm from paying the increased rates because it was
able to pass the higher interconnection termination rates through to its subscribers in the form of a higher tariff
structure. In addition, it would be difficult for Belgacom to refund its subscribers the increased telephony tariffs that it
has been charging them since August 12, 2002. If such a retroactive payment were ordered, our liability would be
substantial.

_Tromboning_

The August 2002 ruling of the BIPT only permitted us to increase termination rates for domestic, not
international, calls to Telenet numbers. We have appealed the BIPT's decision to the Council of State. We have argued
that international interconnection rates should match our domestic rates in order, among other things, to restrict the
practice of tromboning and because the cost to us of terminating calls on the Combined Network is independent of the
call's origin, whether domestic, mobile or international. We do not expect a decision from the Council of State before
2005. In the meantime, this disparity between domestic and international termination rates has provided increased
incentives for tromboning, which arises when inbound domestic calls are rerouted outside of Belgium and then back to
Belgium so that they can take advantage of the lower international interconnection termination rates. See "Risk
Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The Belgian Internet, data and telephony industries are highly competitive
and the television industry may become more competitive in the future, which could result in lower prices and the loss
of subscribers."

The BIPT has authorized limited tromboning by Belgacom to allow Belgacom to compete with other telephony
service providers. Belgacom must submit monthly reports on its tromboning activity to the BIPT. If Belgacom engages
in substantial amounts of tromboning, it may face action from Belgian or EU competition authorities for abuse of its
dominant market position. Belgacom is currently appealing the BIPT's decision to the Council of State. No decision in
this matter is expected before 2005.

**_Canal+ Litigation_**

Since April 2003, we, through MixtICS, have been involved in litigation with the Canal+ group regarding the
termination of the contractual arrangement through which the Canal+ group delivers premium television services to our
cable television subscribers. See “—Our Products and Services—Cable Television—Premium Services.” Our
contractual arrangement with Canal+ had an initial five-year term and automatically renewed for a second five-year
term unless six months notice was given. On April 18, 2003, we delivered a notice to terminate our contract with the
Canal+ group. This notice was delivered before the five-year anniversary of when the Canal+ group first began to
offer services to our subscribers. The Canal+ group challenged the termination notice, however, asserting that it had
not been delivered a full six months before the first term expired. As a result, Canal+ asserts that our contract with it
has been extended automatically for a second five-year term and that it is entitled to retain the use of nine of our 8MHz
channels. This dispute is currently in the Commercial Court of Brussels (Rechtbank van Koophandel). Proceedings
have been delayed until January 2004, however, because the suit will be dismissed by the parties if our acquisition of
the Flemish assets of the Canal+ group is completed. If we cannot complete the acquisition of these assets, however,
the lawsuit likely will be reactivated. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—Conditions imposed on the
Canal+ Acquisition, a failure to complete the Canal+ Acquisition or the inability to ensure sufficient access to premium
programming could have an adverse effect on our operating results.” If the Canal+ group prevails in this case, we may
face monetary damages.

**REGULATION**

The telephony and broadcasting services that we provide are subject to regulation by both Belgian and EU
authorities. In general, the national government regulates the provision of telephony services and the regional
governments regulate broadcasting. Under new rules, the Internet services we provide may also come under increasing
regulation.

**The New Framework**

On March 7, 2002, the European Parliament adopted the new Community Electronic Communications
Regulatory Framework, which we expect will require significant reforms to the telephony, Internet and broadcasting
regulations with which we must comply. This regulatory framework consists of the Framework Directive and four
specific Directives, which include the Universal Service Directive, the Access Directive, the Authorization Directive
and the Data Protection Directive (collectively, the "New Framework"). We do not expect that the Belgian legislature
will implement the New Framework until spring 2004 at the earliest, despite the fact that all EU member states were
required to incorporate the framework into national law by July 24, 2003. Implementation of the New Framework in
Belgium may be further delayed as the national government coordinates necessary changes with the regional
parliaments, which currently have exclusive jurisdiction over broadcasting regulations. The Belgian government may
attempt to accelerate the implementation of the New Framework by implementing certain provisions by Royal Decree.
The European Commission has commenced infringement proceedings against Belgium for failure to implement the
New Framework before the July 24 deadline.

The New Framework is intended to establish a harmonized framework for regulation in the telephony and
broadcasting markets and defines relevant segments of the telephony, Internet and broadcasting markets in accordance
with principles of EU competition law. It directs member countries to examine markets where there is a lack of
effective competition and identifies entities operating in those markets that possess significant market power ("SMP").
Under the New Framework, entities are deemed to have SMP if they have a dominant position in a relevant market
that gives them the ability to behave to an appreciable extent independently of competitors, subscribers and consumers.
An entity is presumed to have SMP if it has a share of 40% or more of a relevant market. The New Framework
requires national regulatory authorities to impose proportionate and objectively justifiable obligations on entities with
SMP to remedy perceived market failures. Currently, the BIPT publishes an annual list of organizations it considers to
have SMP based on a factual analysis that considers, among other things, the resources, revenues and market share of
each relevant entity. A telephony operator is currently deemed to have SMP in a relevant market when it has a market
share of 25% of the relevant market. To date, only Belgacom has been found to have SMP in the fixed telephony
market, among others.

The New Framework also replaces the traditional grant of licenses by national regulatory authorities with
"general authorizations" (except in certain areas, which include licenses to provide telephone numbers). In order to start
their activities, operators will need to obtain a general authorization by sending a notice to the BIPT. Operators will not,
however, be required to obtain individual licenses.

The New Framework may affect not only regulations applicable to telephony service providers and
broadcasters, but also to Internet access providers. "Wholesale broadband access," where it offers facilities equivalent
to bit-stream access, has been identified as a market where an operator can have SMP. If the Belgian authorities
identify this market as a relevant market in Belgium, they must go on to consider whether there is effective competition
in the wholesale broadband market. If we are identified as having SMP in that market, we could be required to provide
other Internet operators and service providers access to our network at regulated prices based on our cost of providing
that access.

**Telephony Regulation**

**_Overview_**

The telecommunications industry in Belgium is regulated by Title III of the law of March 21, 1991 (the "1991
Law") and several royal decrees implementing its provisions. In December 1997, significant amendments were made to
the 1991 Law to comply with EC directives designed to liberalize the EC telecommunications market and increase
competition.

117


-----

The 1991 Law ended the monopoly of the Belgian National Telephone and Telegraph Company (Regie der
_Telegraaf en Telefoon) ("RTT"), which had been the exclusive telecommunications operator in Belgium since 1930._
Under the 1991 Law, the RTT was transformed into an autonomous public company (Autonoom Overheidsbedrijf),
which, in 1994, became a public law corporation (naamloze vennootschap van publiek recht), Belgacom NV
("Belgacom"). The Belgian government is currently reviewing the 1991 Law as part of its implementation of the New
Framework.

118


-----

**_The BIPT and the Advisory Committee_**

_The BIPT_

The 1991 Law also created the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications (Belgisch
_Instituut voor Postdiensten en Telecommunicatie) (the "BIPT"). The BIPT, which commenced its activities in 1993,_
is the supervisory and regulatory body that governs the postal and telecommunications industries in Belgium. The BIPT
is a public interest body supervised by the Minister responsible for telecommunications. It is led by a council of four
officials (the "BIPT Council") who are nominated by Royal Decree upon a decision made by the Council of Ministers.
The BIPT has broad powers to draft regulations, render advice, define strategies, authorize new entrants to provide
telephony service in Belgium and supervise telephony operators to ensure compliance with laws and licenses. The
BIPT also grants licenses to new and existing network infrastructure operators and voice telephony providers and
reviews the terms and conditions under which leased lines are provided. Although BIPT approval is not required to
provide services other than voice telephony, network infrastructure and leased lines, telephony operators must notify
the BIPT of any additional telecommunication services that they intend to provide. The BIPT may also act as a
mediator in disputes arising between telecommunications operators.

The BIPT has significant enforcement powers. It may issue a default notice if any telecommunications service
provider breaches any of the telecommunication provisions of the 1991 Law or its implementing royal decrees. Failure
to comply with the notice may result in administrative penalties ranging from 0.5% to 5% of the provider's annual
revenue attributable to telecommunications, up to a maximum of [€12.5] million. If a service provider refuses to correct a
default, the BIPT may ultimately prohibit the provider from rendering any further services.

Pursuant to the Act of January 17, 2003 a new two-tier dispute resolution system applies to the review of
BIPT actions:

      - disputes regarding interconnection, leased lines, special access, unbundled access to the local loop and
shared access must be brought before the Belgian competition authority; and

      - decisions of the BIPT Council must be appealed to the Brussels' Court of Appeal.

_The Advisory Committee_

The Advisory Committee is an independent entity whose secretary is appointed by the BIPT. The Advisory
Committee also includes representatives of telephony operators (including representatives of the Telenet group),
consumers, providers of universal services and manufacturers of telecommunications equipment. It makes non-binding
recommendations to the ministers responsible for telecommunications on issues related to the telecommunications
market, with a focus on the provision of universal service, general contract provisions between voice telephony
operators and end-users and end-users' rights under the management contract between the Belgian State and
Belgacom.

It is likely that both the structure and role of the BIPT and the Advisory Committee will be reviewed in the
course of the implementation of the New Framework.

**_Universal Service_**

Belgian law mandates that Belgian residents have access at an affordable price to a minimum set of
"universal" services that are available to all fixed-line telephony users regardless of their geographic location in
Belgium. Universal services include the provision of emergency service numbers, the provision of access at a fixed
location, the availability of at least one comprehensive directory enquiry service and the provision of public pay
telephones and specific services for disabled end users.

These services are provided pursuant to a management contract between the Belgian state and Belgacom,
which, among other things, requires Belgacom to pursue certain corporate purposes and adopt a specific corporate
structure and governs the fees that Belgacom can charge for its services.

In August 2003 the BIPT published its annual report on universal service in Belgium. In the report, the BIPT

119


-----

recommends that universal access obligations be created to require Internet access for certain categories of persons or
organizations including disabled persons, libraries, students, schools and hospitals. In addition, the BIPT suggests that
universal service obligations should be imposed on a larger number of operators instead of only on Belgacom. The
Minister for Economic Affairs and the Minister for Consumer Affairs will have to decide whether to take action based
on these recommendations.

The Law of December 19, 1997 established a Universal Service Fund to finance the costs incurred by
universal service providers in offering universal services to the public. The statute establishing the fund specifies that it
is to be financed by contributions from the companies that provide telephony services in Belgium according to criteria
to be defined by royal decree. In 2002, Belgacom requested that the BIPT activate the fund. The BIPT examined
Belgacom's request and recommended to the Ministry of Telecommunications that the fund be activated. To date, no
further initiatives have been taken to activate the fund. If further action is taken to activate the Fund, we do not believe
that our group's annual contribution to the fund would exceed approximately [€2] million (including amounts that would be
paid with respect to Codenet).

Under the New Framework, it is expected that operators will be able to apply to the BIPT to become an
authorized universal service provider. The New Framework also endorses the establishment of universal service funds
and allows national regulatory authorities to compensate universal service providers from either public funds or through
allocating costs among network and service providers.

**_Interconnection_**

Interconnection is the means by which users of one telephony network are able to communicate with users of
another telephony network. In order for a subscriber located on one telephony network to complete a telephone call to
an end user served by another telephony network, the subscriber's network service provider must interconnect to the
network serving the end user. Typically, the network serving the end user charges the subscriber's service provider a
fee to terminate the communication, which is based on the length of the telephone call.

Organizations with SMP must satisfy all reasonable interconnection requests on non-discriminatory terms that
provide equal-access to its network. They must also publish the tariffs they charge to terminate calls that interconnect
to their network. The BIPT has the right to supervise and, if necessary, amend the terms of these interconnection
rates. In addition to entities with SMP, all public network operators and providers of public telecommunications
services, voice telephony or leased lines who, as a result of these activities, control access to end users, must respond
to interconnection requests from other providers of similar services and negotiate interconnection termination fees with
such other providers.

Interconnection costs have a significant impact on our financial results, and we have focused heavily on
managing this cost. See "Business—Our Products and Services—Residential Telephony—Interconnection." Because
the rates we charge to terminate calls that interconnect to the Combined Network are higher for domestic than for
international calls, some operators attempt to route domestic calls outside of Belgium so that when they enter the
Combined Network they are charged the lower international tariff. This practice is known as "tromboning." In general,
the BIPT has held that tromboning is sanctionable under existing law when used as a means of minimizing
interconnection fees. The BIPT has, however authorized limited tromboning by Belgacom to allow Belgacom to
compete more effectively with other telephony service providers. Belgacom is required to submit monthly audits of its
tromboning activity to the BIPT. Belgacom is currently appealing the BIPT's tromboning cap to the Council of State,
contending that it should be able to trombone much higher amounts. See "Business—Legal Proceedings—
Interconnection Litigation—Tromboning" and "Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—The Belgian Internet,
data and telephony industries are highly competitive and the television industry may become more competitive in the
future, which could result in lower prices and the loss of subscribers."

The New Framework requires public communications networks to negotiate interconnection termination rates
with each other to provide, among other things, fixed and mobile telephony services. National regulators must, where
appropriate, ensure adequate interconnection in a way that promotes efficiency and sustainable competition. Under the
New Framework, national authorities can require entities with SMP to permit others to interconnect to their networks
and facilities if the authority determines that denial of access to such an entity's network (whether through a direct
denial of access or the imposition of unreasonable terms and conditions) would hinder the creation of a competitive
retail market or would not be in the consumer's interest.

120


-----

The New Framework also permits governments to regulate the prices that entities with SMP may charge to
interconnect to their network facilities, requiring entities with SMP to charge interconnection termination fees that
reflect their actual costs of terminating out-of-network calls. The New Framework, however, does not prescribe the
model that national regulators should use to evaluate interconnection prices, simply noting that entities with SMP should
be allowed to receive a reasonable rate of return on capital employed, including labor and building costs, and reflecting
the current fair value of assets and operational efficiency. In addition, the New Framework requires that prices
charged be appropriate to the circumstances, taking account the need to promote efficiency and sustainable
competition.

In a Commission Recommendation dated February 11, 2003, the European Commission indicated that, under
the New Framework, the market for wholesale call termination may be considered as a separate product market
subject to regulation in the absence of competition. Such a market definition does not automatically mean that every
network operator has significant market power to terminate calls on its own network. Whether such power exists
depends on whether any users of the network account for a large portion of the calls terminated on the network, giving
that user a countervailing position as a strong buyer. However, Telenet may at some future date be considered to have
a dominant position when setting the fees it charges to terminate calls on its network. Such a determination would
depend, among other things, on the number of voice telephony subscribers Telenet has—the more Telenet voice
telephony subscribers, the lower Belgacom's countervailing buyer power, the higher the risk of Telenet being
considered to have significant market power to terminate calls on the Combined Network.

If Telenet is considered as having significant market power to terminate calls and the interconnection rates that
it charges are found to be above its costs, the BIPT could require Telenet to decrease its interconnection termination
rates.

**_Fixed-Mobile Interconnection_**

The price for the interconnection of traffic originating on fixed-line networks and terminating on mobile
networks is not subject to any regulatory restrictions, unless a mobile operator is determined by the BIPT to have SMP
in the national market for interconnection. In general, interconnection termination rates charged by mobile network
operators are significantly higher than those charged by fixed-line operators.

The BIPT has designated both Belgacom Mobile NV (Belgacom's mobile subsidiary, known as "Proximus")
and Mobistar NV as entities that have SMP in the national interconnection market. As a result, both mobile operators
are required to charge interconnection tariffs that are based on their cost of providing those services. In addition, their
tariffs must be non-discriminatory and transparent. For a description of our interconnection agreements with Proximus
and Mobistar, see "Business—Our Products and Services—Residential Telephony—Interconnection." A third mobile
operator in Belgium, Base, is not bound by these restrictions.

**_Tariffs_**

The prices that telephony operators and other service providers charge their subscribers are not subject to any
explicit legal constraints as long as the operators do not have SMP. Organizations with SMP must offer tariffs in the
leased line, voice telephony, interconnection and special access markets that are based on their actual cost of providing
those services.

The New Framework requires each national authority to impose appropriate obligations on entities with SMP in
relevant retail and wholesale markets identified by that national authority. National authorities may prevent entities with
SMP from charging excessive prices, inhibiting market entry or restricting competition through predatory pricing,
bundling services in an unreasonable manner and offering unduly preferential terms to specific end-users.

**_Telephone Numbering System_**

The BIPT manages the national telephone numbering system for Belgium and allocates telephone numbers to
network operators and service providers. The BIPT must perform these functions in an objective, transparent and nondiscriminatory manner.

121


-----

**_Number Portability_**

Since January 1, 2000, all Belgian fixed-line operators have been legally required to provide full geographic and
non-geographic number portability. Number portability allows:

      - A subscriber to move within geographic zones without changing the subscriber's directory telephone
number.

      - A subscriber to change operators without changing the subscriber's directory telephone number.

Number portability has provided a significant opportunity for us because it facilitates the movement of
subscribers from Belgacom to Telenet.

The New Framework preserves the number portability requirement.

**_Unbundling the Belgacom Local Loop_**

The Belgian legislature has implemented EC regulation No 2887/2000 on unbundled access to the local loop,
which requires operators that have been designated by their national regulatory authorities as having SMP to give full
unbundled access to their local loop. Under this regulation, the BIPT has required Belgacom to provide other telephony
service providers shared use and bit-stream access to its local loop, which delivers communication signals from central
networks to the actual homes and businesses served by Belgacom. The unbundling of the Belgacom local loop has not
progressed rapidly, however. At the end of 2002, only 2,500 lines had been fully unbundled, with 1,632 of those lines
offering shared access, representing a very small fraction of the number of lines subject to unbundling under the rule.
Further implementation of the local loop unbundling requirement has been delayed until the Belgian legislature considers
whether current unbundling requirements should remain in force, be amended or withdrawn in light of the New
Framework.

**_Carrier Preselection_**

Carrier preselection allows a telephony end user to elect to receive certain services (for example, long distance
calling) on an ongoing basis from providers whose network does not directly serve the end user. We use carrier
preselection to provide telephony service to subscribers who can only receive telephony service through the Belgacom
network because they reside in regions of Flanders where we have not yet installed equipment in our head end stations
that would allow them to receive telephony service directly from us. Currently, it is not commercially feasible for other
service providers to offer carrier preselection services through the Combined Network because the fees we must
charge to recover our costs are too high to allow for competitive retail offers.

The New Framework requires that entities with SMP in the control of access to and use of public networks
allow end users served by their network to access the services of another telephone service provider through using
both (i) a carrier selection code which the end user can use on a call-by-call basis and (ii) carrier preselection.

**_Licenses_**

Under the 1991 Law, we are required to obtain from the BIPT a voice telephony license and network
infrastructure license in order to provide fixed-line telephony services to our subscribers in Flanders. There are no
express transfer restrictions in these licenses. Upon the recommendation of the BIPT however, the appropriate
Minister would be required to grant his or her prior consent to the transfer of the license. Under the New Framework,
these licenses will be replaced with general authorizations.

_Voice Telephony License_

The BIPT has granted Telenet Operaties a license that permits it to:

      - establish and provide voice telephony services in Belgium;

      - provide local, national and international long-distance telephone services through a carrier preselection

122


-----

service; and

       - provide related additional services, including call waiting, conference calling, voice-mail and 0800
numbers.

We agreed in our application for a voice telephony license to comply with a number of minimum quality
requirements, which the BIPT is authorized to monitor. These requirements include:

**Item** **Requirement**

Blocked calls........... Maximum rate of blocked calls of 1.5% for calls within the European Union
Connection time ...... Maximum time for the connection to the public switched telephony network: 90% within one day
in 2003
Fault reports............ Less than four fault reports per 100 subscribers per month

We are in compliance with all relevant quality requirements.

Under the New Framework, quality requirements may still be imposed as a condition for receipt of the general
authorization that will replace our voice telephony license. The New Framework, however, specifies an exhaustive list
of conditions that the BIPT can include in such general authorization. Some of the existing conditions imposed on our
group under this license cannot be imposed following the implementation of the New Framework.

_Infrastructure License_

The infrastructure license granted to Telenet Operaties authorizes it to operate a network to provide public
telecommunication services in Flanders and to operate a limited telecommunications network in the Brussels region.
The provisions restricting transferability and changes in control are similar to those of its voice telephony license. Our
recent acquisition of Codenet has expanded our network operations into the French-speaking region of Belgium and
increased the extent of our operations in Brussels. In the near term we plan to continue to use Codenet's existing
infrastructure license, which permits operations in these areas, to conduct these broader activities.

**Broadcasting Regulation**

Unlike telecommunications, which is subject to comprehensive national regulation, radio and television
broadcasting is generally regulated by the regional Flemish and French-speaking communities of Belgium. The Council
of State has determined that the regulatory authority of the communities applies to all relevant broadcasting
technologies, and thus includes satellite, terrestrial and cable broadcasting. The Flemish and French-speaking
communities have adopted legislation (in the form of decrees) that governs the provision of broadcasting services in
their respective regions. The national government retains authority to regulate broadcasting in the region of Brussels. In
addition, the national government can regulate certain non-broadcast aspects related to radio communications, including
limiting the power of broadcast emitters and establishing safety and technical requirements for radio receivers and
other equipment.

Our cable activities are exclusively located in Flanders and are governed by the Coordinated Media Decree of
January 25, 1995 (the "Media Decree"). The Media Decree vests the Flemish Media Commission (Vlaams
_Commissariaat voor de Media) (the "VCM") with the authority to regulate and supervise the provision of broadcast_
services and the use of related network equipment in Flanders. The VCM consists of six officials appointed by the
Flemish government.

The Media Decree authorizes the VCM to:

       - issue orders to cease and desist from any violation of the Media Decree;

       - require broadcasters to broadcast any decision of the VCM in a form and at a time determined by the
VCM;

123


-----

      - levy administrative fines for violations of the Media Decree; and

      - suspend or withdraw licenses.

We expect that many provisions of the Media Decree that relate to electronic communications networks and
services, including those provided by us, will either be heavily amended or repealed and replaced during 2004 as the
New Framework is implemented in Belgium. In addition, the VCM may not retain responsibility for regulating
broadcasting networks and services following implementation of the New Framework.

**_Providing Access to Broadcasting Transmission Services_**

The New Framework identifies "broadcasting transmission services to deliver broadcast content to end-users"
as a candidate market in which national authorities may decide to regulate the behavior of entities that possess SMP. If
the Belgian authorities identify this sector as a relevant market, they must go on to consider whether the broadcast
market is competitive. If it is not, and we are identified as having SMP in that market, governmental authorities could
require us (as one of a range of possible remedies) to provide other content broadcasters access to our network at
prices based on our cost of providing that access. Depending on the specific facts and circumstances, however, we
may refuse requests for access to our network on a number of grounds, including a lack of network capacity or in
order to protect network security. As part of its approval of the Canal+ Acquisition, the Belgian competition authorities
required that we grant other pay television channels access to our network to allow them to broadcast their services.
We must grant them access based on non-discriminatory, commercial criteria, taking into account the available
capacity on our network. See "Business—Our Products and Services—Cable Television—Premium Services."

**_Broadcast Licenses_**

We hold two types of licenses to operate and distribute cable television signals to subscribers—licenses related
to the delivery of signals to subscribers over our local loop and licenses related to the transportation of signals over our
fiber backbone to the head ends on our network. To the extent these licenses regulate the provision of electronic
communications networks and services, they are likely to be replaced with general authorizations under the New
Framework.

_License to Deliver Signals to Customers_

The Media Decree prohibits the construction and operation of a cable network without a license from the
VCM. The ten licenses held by MixtICS (which it received from the ten MICs when it acquired their cable television
assets in August 2002) define its service area, broadcasting programs and the services it can transmit to end users. The
licenses are valid for nine years, of which three and a half years remain but are extendable for consecutive periods of
nine years unless the VCM revokes them.

_License to Transport Signals Between Networks and Head Ends_

The VCM is responsible for approving the construction and operation of the infrastructure needed to transport
program signals to and between cable networks and between head end stations. Telenet Operaties holds our
infrastructure license.

**_Must Carry_**

The Media Decree imposes certain must carry obligations on cable operators. These rules are to a large extent
based on the language of the content broadcast—the Flemish community has stated that it is in the public interest for
every citizen to receive information, education, culture and entertainment in his or her own language. The must carry
rules currently cover 15 television channels that we transmit to any region of Flanders. These rules are not of limited
duration and only apply to cable networks.

The Media Decree provides a list of the programs that operators may transmit over their networks. Under the
Media Decree, we must transmit the following radio stations and television channels:

124


-----

      - the radio stations and television channels of VRT, the Flemish public broadcaster, that are directed to
an audience located in the operational area of our cable network, provided the stations and channels
carry programs that are partly in the Dutch language;

      - the television channels of authorized private broadcasters, such as VTM, destined for the entire
Flemish community, provided the channels carry programs that are partly in the Dutch language;

      - the television channels of authorized regional broadcasters, such as ATV and RTV, provided they are
in the Dutch language. These channels only need to be delivered to residents of the geographic areas
served by the regional broadcaster;

      - two radio stations and two television channels of RTBF, the French public broadcaster, and the radio
station of the public broadcaster of the German community; and

      - two radio stations and three television channels (NOS 1, NOS 2 and NOS 3), of the public broadcaster
of the Netherlands.

We may charge commercial rates for carrying these stations and channels over our network, except for the programs
of the regional broadcasters, whose programs we must carry for free and for the programs of the public broadcasters
whose programs we also carry free of charge.

The New Framework will permit EU Member States to continue to impose reasonable and proportional must
carry obligations for specified radio and television broadcast channels and services that are broadcast through
electronic communication networks if those networks serve as the principal means of distributing programs to a
significant number of end users. In addition, a Member State may set "appropriate remuneration" in relation to the
carriage of must carry channels and services. Studies are now underway by the EU to establish guidelines for what
constitutes appropriate remuneration in these circumstances.

**_Pricing of Cable Package_**

The Law of January 25, 1945 on economic regulation and pricing (the "Pricing Law") and the Ministerial
Decree of April 20, 1993 regarding special regulation on prices (the "1993 Ministerial Decree") require television
broadcasters, among others, to receive the prior consent of the Minister for Economic Affairs before they can
implement any price increase. The 1993 Ministerial Decree, which is applicable in the French and Flemish communities
as well as the Region of Brussels, specifies the procedures that television broadcasters, including us, must follow in
order to increase fees charged to subscribers. Pursuant to the Pricing Law and the Royal Decree of June 3, 1969, the
Pricing Committee was established to advise the Minister for Economic Affairs on pricing policies and to administer the
price increase process. The Pricing Committee is a part of the national Ministry of Economic Affairs and consists of a
total of 88 members, of whom half are alternate members. Members of the Pricing Committee are drawn from various
industry and user groups. Individual matters brought before the Pricing Committee are reviewed by a subcommittee of
approximately ten members who come from the specific industries and user groups with knowledge of the subject
matter under review.

A television broadcaster may not charge more for its services than the price approved by the Minister for
Economic Affairs, whose decision is based on the recommendation of the Pricing Committee. Companies may,
however, freely decide to charge amounts under this maximum. In the beginning of 2003, the Minister for Economic
Affairs authorized us to increase the subscription fees for our cable television services by approximately 25%.

Copyright fees charged to subscribers are not subject to these pricing restrictions, although notices of price
increases must be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Prices for new products must be transmitted to the
service of General Inspection, established by the 1993 Ministerial Decree upon recommendation of the Pricing
Committee, no later than ten days before they are implemented.

**_Copyright and Retransmission Restrictions_**

The EU directive of September 27, 1993, governing the coordination of certain rules concerning copyright
applicable to satellite broadcasting and cable retransmission has been implemented in Belgium by the national Law on

125


-----

Copyright of June 30, 1994. The national government, acting through the Ministry of Justice, regulates all issues related
to copyright.

Pursuant to case-law of the Belgian Supreme Court and the national Law on Copyright of June 30, 1994, cable
companies must receive approval from the holders of the relevant copyrights and related rights to transmit protected
works over the cable operators' networks, irrespective of whether the works are redistributed or directly generated by
the cable company. Under Article 100 of the Media Decree, broadcasters are prohibited from broadcasting audiovisual
works at times different from those agreed with the rights-holders.

We broadcast copyrighted works over our cable network pursuant to agreements with several broadcasters
and agencies that represent the holders of various foreign and domestic copyrights. These agreements have been the
subject of recent litigation. See "Business—Legal Proceedings—Copyright Litigation."

**_Pay Television and Canal Plus Acquisition_**

The Media Decree will govern the premium pay television services that we expect to provide upon completion
of our acquisition of certain assets from Canal+. On August 29, 2003, the VCM approved the transfer of the pay
television and pay per view license held by Canal+ to our subsidiary PayTVCo, contingent on the acquisition being
approved by the Belgian competition authority, which conditionally approved the acquisition on November 12, 2003. See
"Business—Our Products and Services—Cable Television—Premium Services."

**MANAGEMENT AND GOVERNANCE**

The Issuer, Telenet Communications NV, is a holding company with no operations. It is a direct subsidiary of
Telenet Group Holding NV ("Telenet Group Holding"). The principal shareholders of Telenet Group Holding, namely
the MICs, the Cable Partners Consortium, Electrabel, the Financial Consortium, GIMV and Interkabel (the
"Shareholders"), expect to enter into a new agreement dated on or about the closing date of this offering (the
"Shareholders' Agreement") regarding the governance of Telenet Group Holding, the Issuer, Telenet Bidco, Telenet
Holding, Telenet Vlaanderen, Telenet Operaties and MixtICS (each, a "Company" and, collectively, the "Companies").

**Board of Directors**

Pursuant to the Shareholders' Agreement, the Cable Partners Consortium has the right to appoint half of the
members of our board of directors, including the chairman, who has a casting vote, through December 31, 2004. In
general, each of the Issuer and the other Companies are intended to have identical boards of directors unless otherwise
required by law; consequently, Cable Partners controls the management of the Companies, subject to certain
supermajority voting requirements. See "—Shareholders' Agreement—Votes of the Boards of Directors." The ability
of Cable Partners to control the boards of directors could end before December 31, 2004 under certain circumstances,
including if the Cable Partners Consortium ceases to own at least 17.2% of the Qualified Shares of Telenet Group
Holding or if there is a change of control of Cable Partners or certain of its subsidiaries and our other principal
shareholders vote to terminate Cable Partners' control. See "—Shareholders' Agreement—Composition of the Boards
of Directors—Governance Period" and "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Management and Principal
Shareholders—Our controlling shareholder, Cable Partners, is likely to undergo a restructuring, which may result in a
change of ownership in the near future that could give a third party a significant degree of control over Telenet." The
"Qualified Shares" are the outstanding shares of Telenet Group Holding excluding shares issued in connection with our
acquisition of Codenet, shares issued upon exercise of the Subordinated Debt Warrants and shares issued with respect
to other warrants under which CAI Belgium does not have preemptive rights.

The other Shareholders have the right to appoint additional members of our boards of directors, which currently
consist of 16 members each. As of the date hereof, the members of the board of directors of each of the Companies
(and their ages as of December 1, 2003) are:

2026 and, to the extent permitted by law, is renewable for consecutive periods of ten years unless a termination notice
is given at least five years prior to the expiration of the current term. Aspects of the agreement which can be
construed as voting agreements have a duration of ten years and are renewed each year for a further period of ten
years up to, but not beyond the term of, the Shareholders' Agreement itself, unless notice of non-renewal is given at
least one year before any renewal date.

**_Development Plans and the Public Interest Guarantees_**

The parties to the Shareholders' Agreement have undertaken to operate the Companies for the purpose of
implementing the Development Plan, the ICS Development Plan and the Public Interest Guarantees. The Development
Plan is a five year capital and strategic plan that runs from March 30, 2001 through March 30, 2006. During the term
of the Development Plan, the Companies:

      - Cannot effect aggregate equity contributions in excess of [€ 50] million other than to acquire businesses
in the communications industry.

130


-----

      - Cannot incur aggregate indebtedness from time to time in excess of amounts that can be borrowed
without shareholder guarantees.

      - Must provide Internet and mass-market fixed telephony through Telenet's existing network in all of
Flanders.

      - Must develop and pursue a strategy to provide telecommunications services to the SME and corporate
markets in Flanders.

The ICS Development Plan adds a commitment to the Development Plan requiring the Companies to provide
television and radio broadcasting services to substantially all of the territories covered by the MICs as of August 9,
2002. This obligation continues until August 9, 2007.

The Public Interest Guarantees set certain parameters for the price and content of our basic cable television
package in Flanders in relation to the migration of channels to a digital package, the schedule and penetration rate for
our roll-out of digital television services in Flanders and the provision to local governments in Flanders of public services
that utilize new technologies at prices equal to our cost of providing the service. Compliance with the Public Interest
Guarantees is overseen by the Regulatory Board. See "—Regulatory Board." We have not previously met various
deadlines in the Public Interest Guarantees, and, in connection with the offering of the Notes, on November 28, 2003,
the Regulatory Board approved a specific amendment to the dates for launching iDTV. See "Risk Factors—Risks
Relating to our Financial Profile—We are contractually obligated to commercially launch a digital television platform
by March 2005, and our financial condition and cash flows may be impaired by our efforts to launch digital television
and any liability we incur if we fail to launch digital television."

**_Composition of the Boards of Directors_**

_General_

Pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement, the board of directors of Telenet Group Holding
consists of 16 members, two of whom are independent directors. Subject to special rules relating to the nomination of
directors during the Governance Period (discussed below), the shareholders of Telenet Group Holding have the right to
nominate the number of directors that is as proportional as possible to their share ownership in the company. For these
purposes, shareholders of Telenet Group Holding do not include shareholders who acquired their Shares from exercise
of various warrants and stock option plans and Shares owned by the entities described under "Principal Shareholders—
Additional Shareholders" (such shareholders who are not so excluded being the "Eligible Shareholders").

The original shareholders of Telenet Group Holding, which consist of the Cable Partners Consortium, the
MICs, Electrabel, the Financial Consortium, GIMV and Interkabel and certain of their related party transferees, shall
always have the right to appoint one director as long as those shareholders only transfer their Shares in certain
permitted transactions. Other Eligible Shareholders shall be able to nominate a member of the Telenet Group Holding
board of directors as long as they hold at least 7% of the Shares.

_Independent Directors_

The independent directors are elected by a majority of the Eligible Shareholders excluding any majority
shareholder.

_Governance Period_

Until the earlier of the time that the Cable Partners Consortium ceases to hold at least 17.2% of the
outstanding Qualified Shares and December 31, 2004 (the end of the "Governance Period"), it shall have the right to
nominate one-half of the board of directors of Telenet Group Holding, including the Chairman of the Board. The
Chairman of the Board has a casting vote to break any tied votes of the board of directors. During the Governance
Period, the remaining shareholders of Telenet Group Holding have the right to nominate the remaining members of the
board of directors as follows:

131


-----

      - The MICs (based on a majority vote) have the right to nominate two directors;

      - Electrabel has the right to nominate one director;

      - The Financial Consortium has the right to nominate one director;

      - GIMV has the right to nominate one director;

      - Interkabel has the right to nominate one director; and

      - The majority of the Eligible Shareholders, excluding the Cable Partners Consortium, has the right to
nominate the two independent directors.

The Governance Period can be terminated by a majority of the Eligible Shareholders (other than the Cable
Partners Consortium) if there is a change of control of Cable Partners or any of its subsidiaries that directly or
indirectly owns shares of CAI Belgium (each, a "Cable Partners Company"). A change of control includes:

      - The failure of both Richard J. Callahan and Andrew J. Sukawaty to be actively involved in the
management and leadership of the relevant Cable Partners Company as a result of a capital increase
or transfer of shares, resignation or dismissal (or, in the event of the death or disability of
Messrs. Callahan and Sukawaty before such event occurs, the failure of the Managing Member of the
relevant Cable Partners Company to perform these functions);

      - The failure of the relevant Cable Partners Company to own and control 50.1% of the voting equity of
CAI Belgium, except as a result of dilution of its interest solely for the purposes of making an
investment in Telenet Bidco and its restricted subsidiaries in accordance with the terms of the Telenet
group's senior credit facility; or

      - A competitive investor (i) obtains sole control over or the right to approve the annual budget, material
borrowings or material acquisitions of the relevant Cable Partners Company and (ii) owns at least
49.9% of the equity (excluding non-voting equity) of the relevant Cable Partners Company or controls
at least 50% of the votes of the board of directors or any other governing body of the relevant Cable
Partners Company. A competitive investor is any entity (other than certain financial investors) that
invests in another entity seeking to establish or operate a fixed network for point-to-point
telecommunications or broadcasting services.

See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Management and Principal Shareholders—Our controlling
shareholder, Cable Partners, is likely to undergo a restructuring, which may result in a change of ownership in the near
future that could give a third party a significant degree of control over Telenet."

_Other Companies_

In general, the boards of directors of the other Companies are composed and conduct business in the same
way as Telenet Group Holding. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, Interkabel always has the right to nominate
one director for the board of directors of Telenet Vlaanderen as long as Telenet Vlaanderen has rights to use the PICs
Network under the Interkabel Contribution Deed.

**_Votes of the Boards of Directors_**

In general, the board of directors of each of the Companies makes decisions based on a simple majority of the
directors present or duly represented at the meeting at which the vote is taken. The Shareholders' Agreement,
however, imposes special voting requirements for votes on certain matters. It requires that a certain percentage of
directors approve decisions made with respect to specific issues and also requires that a fixed number of directors
appointed by any of the MICs, Electrabel, the Financial Consortium, GIMV and Interkabel (or their affiliates or certain
related party transferees) (collectively, the "Belgian Shareholders") or certain other shareholders approve the decision.

During the Governance Period, most decisions of the board of directors are based on a simple majority.

132


-----

Depending on the number of directors that the Belgian Shareholders can appoint, however (excluding the independent
directors), the affirmative vote of between one and three directors appointed by the Belgian Shareholders is needed to
approve the following actions, among others:

       - acquiring businesses;

       - the sale of a substantial part of the assets of any of the Companies;

       - the appointment of the Chief Executive Officer of the Companies;

       - the issuance of debt above certain levels; and

       - approval of the annual budget and increases in expenditures of more than 10% per calendar quarter of
the amount approved in the annual budget.

During any period when (i) the Cable Partners Consortium or any other party who owns a majority of the
Shares has the right to appoint a majority of the board of directors of Telenet Group Holding and (ii) the Belgian
Shareholders do not have the right to nominate at least three directors (excluding the independent directors), then at
least one or two directors (depending on the subject matter of the proposal) other than the directors appointed by the
Cable Partners Consortium or such other party must vote in favor of the proposals listed above. A decision to remove
the Chief Executive Officer of the Companies during the Governance Period only requires the vote of a majority of the
relevant Company's directors increased by one.

**_Regulatory Board_**

The Regulatory Board is intended to oversee the compliance of our group with the Public Interest Guarantees.
The Regulatory Board consists of ten Class A directors and ten Class B directors. The Class A directors are appointed
by the holders of our Golden shares, which are the ten MICs, and must include the members of the Telenet Group
Holding board of directors appointed by Electrabel and the MICs. The Class B directors are appointed by the board of
directors of Telenet Group Holding. All decisions of the Regulatory Board may only be taken by a majority of each of
the Class A directors and Class B directors voting as a separate class.

€2.3 million in cash, including bonuses for 2002 paid in 2003 but excluding other employee benefits. These individuals
collectively owned warrants to acquire 2,250 shares of Telenet Holding. Senior management will over the next 36
months become entitled to options and warrants relating to approximately 600,000 shares of Telenet Group Holding.

**_Shareholders' Agreement_**

Under the Shareholders' Agreement, during the Governance Period the Eligible Shareholders other than the

senior officers of the Telenet group other than the Chief Executive Officer. The Chief Executive Officer may veto any
such nomination on reasonable grounds and can terminate such officer's employment.

The Shareholders' Agreement also requires the Cable Partners Consortium and its affiliates (including entities
in which it has an operational role) to obtain the consent of a majority of the board of directors of Telenet Group
Holding, including at least one director not nominated by the Cable Partners Consortium, to solicit management
employees to work outside of the Telenet group if that person was employed by any of the Companies as of March 30,

**_Strategic Services Agreement and Management Agreement_**

We have entered into a strategic services agreement ("Strategic Services Agreement") and expect to enter
into a pre-agreed management agreement ("Management Agreement") with Cable Partners pursuant to which Cable
Partners has agreed to provide us with certain services. Under the Strategic Services Agreement, Cable Partners

135


-----

provides us with numerous services, including advice on long-term strategic planning, cost management and the growth,
marketing, financing and operation of our business. For 2003, we expect to pay Cable Partners $3 million under the
Strategic Services Agreement. The term of the Strategic Services Agreement expires on March 30, 2006.

At the end of the Governance Period, we will enter into the Management Agreement with Cable Partners,
pursuant to which Cable Partners will agree upon expiration of the Strategic Services Agreement to develop an annual
business plan; prepare annual budgets and other reports requested by the board of directors of Telenet Group Holding;
monitor accounting, billing and other financial and management information systems; prepare and deliver necessary
financial statements; negotiate interconnection agreements, leases and licenses; provide marketing advice; identify
investment opportunities; monitor employment policies; coordinate network maintenance and construction; and provide
other services and information as the board of directors may reasonably request. Cable Partners will perform these
services subject to the annual budget approved by the board of directors of Telenet Group Holding, the relevant
provisions of the Shareholders' Agreement and any directions provided by the board of directors.

Under the Management Agreement, Cable Partners will have the right to nominate the Chief Executive
Officer of Telenet Group Holding, who must be appointed by the directors as described under "—Shareholders'
Agreement—Votes of the Boards of Directors." Except for the member of management appointed by the Eligible
Shareholders other than the Cable Partners Consortium, as described above under "—Shareholders' Agreement" all
members of management will have to be presented for approval to the Board of Directors by the Chief Executive
Officer.

Telenet Group Holding will be able to terminate the Management Agreement in certain circumstances. These
circumstances include, among others:

      - any change of control of a Cable Partners Company described above under "—Shareholders'
Agreement—Composition of the Boards of Directors—Governance Period";

      - during the Governance Period, the transfer by any member of the Cable Partners Consortium to a
person, other than Cable Partners or certain of its affiliates, of a sufficient number of shares of entities
in the Cable Partners Consortium such that the acquiror would directly or indirectly own more than
50% of the share capital of the Cable Partners Consortium;

      - the grant by CAI Belgium or the Cable Partners Consortium to a person other than Cable Partners or
certain of its affiliates of the right to appoint or control a majority of the board of directors of CAI
Belgium or any of the Companies, subject to exceptions involving a capital increase in CAI Belgium or
the Cable Partners Consortium following which Cable Partners maintains joint control over the annual
budget, decisions to borrow over [€25] million and decisions to make acquisitions where the
consideration paid exceeds [€75] million for each of CAI Belgium and Telenet Group Holding; or

      - the transfer by the Cable Partners Consortium of more than 40% of the Shares that it held on
August 9, 2002, or more than 40% of certain options to purchase Shares (or the Shares acquired by
the exercise of such options), to another party. See "Principal Shareholders—Option Agreements."

The term of the Management Agreement will continue until December 31, 2006, and can be extended by
agreement of the parties on the payment of appropriate fees until December 31, 2007. No fees, other than expenses,
are payable to Cable Partners for services rendered under the Management Agreement during the term of the
Strategic Services Agreement.

exercise price of [€40. Warrantholders may also exercise the Subordinated Debt Warrants at a reduced price of €0.01,]
but will then receive a reduced number of Shares equal to the number of warrants exercised less the quotient of [€40]
multiplied by the number of warrants exercised divided by the fair market value of a Share (as determined by an
independent investment bank pursuant to the terms of the Subordinated Debt Warrants). Transfers of the Subordinated
Debt Warrants are subject to the same restrictions on transfer applicable to Shares under the Shareholders' Agreement
and Telenet Group Holdings' Articles of Association. The warrants expire on August 9, 2009.

**Employee Stock Ownership Plans**

A number of employees own shares in Telenet Group Holding and Telenet Holding following their exercise of
warrants that they received under our 1998 and 1999 employee stock ownership plans ("ESOPs"). The 1998 and 1999
ESOPs granted employees of the Telenet group warrants to acquire shares of Telenet Holding. Shares obtained upon
exercise of the 1998 and 1999 ESOP warrants can under certain conditions be converted into shares of Telenet Group
Holding based on a ratio reflecting the fair market value of Telenet Holding and Telenet Group Holding at the time of
the exchange. In addition, Telenet Group Holding recently adopted a 2003 ESOP, which will grant warrants to acquire
Shares of Telenet Group Holding. Currently, no warrants have been granted under the ESOP 2003. The following table
provides information regarding our current ESOPs as of September 30, 2003.

(1) All warrants are currently vested.

(2) The 1999 ESOP warrants originally were to expire on November 22, 2009. On May 28, 2003 the expiration of these warrants was
extended until November 22, 2012 for those individuals who were still employed by Telenet at the time of the extension.

(3) The warrants under the 2003 ESOP vest as follows: 25% on the first anniversary of the date of grant, with the remaining 75% vesting
in 36 equal installments over a period of 36 months following the first anniversary of the date of grant. In the event of an initial public
offering, all options vest automatically, unless the initial public offering occurs within 12 months following the grant. All warrants
automatically vest upon a change of control of Telenet Group Holding (with certain exceptions), unless a change of control occurs
within 12 months following the grant. There are two exercise periods for vested warrants each year: April 1-April 15 and September 1September 15.

**Golden Shares**

As part of the MixtICS Acquisition, we issued one Golden Share in Telenet Group Holding to each of the ten
MICs. The holders of the Golden Shares have the authority to elect the ten Class A directors of our regulatory board,
which allows the MICs to monitor our compliance with and revise the terms of the Public Interest Guarantees. See
"Management and Governance—Shareholders' Agreement—Development Plans and Public Interest Guarantees."
Pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders' Agreement, the Golden Shares are freely transferable to other public law
entities, and must be transferred by a holder within four weeks of that holder ceasing to be a public law entity.

**Recent Changes in our Principal Shareholders**

The Cable Partners Consortium acquired an interest in our group in March 2001, and in August 2002, we
acquired the cable television assets of MixtICS. See "Our History." At the closing of the MixtICS Acquisition, the initial
majority interest in our group acquired by the Cable Partners Consortium in March 2001 declined to its present level,
and the ownership of our other principal shareholders increased to their current levels. As part of this transaction,

-----

Electrabel became an indirect 4.9% shareholder of Telenet Group Holding.

**Shareholders' Agreement**

The Shareholders' Agreement, among other things, sets forth certain voting rights and requirements among the
Shareholders, restricts the transferability of their Shares and provides a mechanism for future capital increases of
Telenet Group Holding.

**_Voting Rights and Requirements_**

The Shareholders' Agreement provides that decisions at Telenet Group Holding's general shareholders'
meetings shall be made by a simple majority of the votes present, except as required by law or the Shareholders'
Agreement. The Shareholders' Agreement specifies that certain actions can be taken only if a specified percentage of
the votes, excluding the votes held by J.P. Morgan Corporate Resources Limited, Merrill Lynch International, The
Royal Bank of Scotland, WestLB Finance (Credits) Limited, NIB Capital Bank (Belgian branch), the European
Investment Bank, Lloyds TSB Bank plc (Belgian branch) and our employees (such votes, other than the excluded
votes, the "Eligible Votes"), have approved the action. These actions include:

      - Certain agreed capital increases, which must be approved by a simple majority of the Eligible Votes;

      - Any repurchase of Shares, or decisions relating to the appointment of liquidators or dissolution of a
Company, which must be approved by 63.5% of Eligible Votes;

      - Acquisitions for Shares of communications industry businesses not owned or controlled by affiliates of
Shareholders, which, among other things, must be approved by 62.5% of Eligible Votes; and

      - Acquisitions for Shares of companies that are (a) owned or controlled by an affiliate of a Shareholder,
(b) not engaged in the communications industry or (c) that are effected by valuing Shares issued for
the acquisition below fair market value (as determined by an investment bank that has not worked for
any of the Shareholders in the preceding twelve months), which must be approved by 83.5% of Eligible
Votes.

In addition, as long as the Cable Partners Consortium owns at least 21.548% of the Qualified Shares, the
Shareholders agree that the Cable Partners Consortium shall be deemed to have the voting power of a Shareholder
owning 25% of the Shares plus one Share, allowing it to block certain votes that require the affirmative vote of 75% of
the Shareholders under Belgian law, which includes all amendments to our articles of association (including equity
increases), dissolution and liquidation of a company (unless court ordered) and mergers, splits and certain asset and
other transfers based on an exchange of shares. Votes to restrict preferred subscription rights require the vote of 75%
of the votes represented at the relevant shareholders' meeting.

The Cable Partners Consortium also is able to appoint one-half of the board of directors for each Company,
including the chairman (who has a casting vote in the event of any tie vote on the board of directors of a Company), as
long as the Cable Partners Consortium continues to hold at least 17.2% of the Qualified Shares. The Cable Partners
Consortium may continue to appoint one-half of the board of directors for each Company after it owns less than 17.2%
of the Qualified Shares if a majority of the other Shareholders consent, but its privilege ends in any event no later than
December 31, 2004. As a result of this arrangement, Cable Partners has effective control over the boards of directors
of the Companies, subject to certain qualifications. See "Management and Governance—Shareholders' Agreement—
Composition of the Boards of Directors." Cable Partners is likely to undergo a restructuring, which may result in a
change of ownership in the near future. See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Management and Principal
Shareholders—Our controlling shareholder, Cable Partners, is likely to undergo a restructuring, which may result in a
change of ownership in the near future that could give a third party a significant degree of control over Telenet."

**_Transfer Restrictions_**

The Cable Partners Consortium has agreed that prior to any initial public offering of Shares of Telenet Group
Holding it will not, without the consent of 60% of the remaining parties to the Shareholders' Agreement, transfer any
Shares that it holds until the earlier of December 31, 2006 and the Release Date if the transfer would cause the Cable

140


-----

Partners Consortium to fall below 17.2% ownership of Telenet Group Holding. The "Release Date" is defined under
our senior credit facility as being the later of March 31, 2005 and the last day of a financial quarter for Telenet Bidco in
which the ratio of senior debt to annualized EBITDA for the Telenet Bidco group (each, as calculated under the senior
credit facility) is less than or equal to 3.0:1. Certain transfers to Motorola are exempted from this restriction, however.
Similarly, the MICs and Electrabel have agreed that until January 31, 2004, they will not transfer their Shares to a third
party if the transfer would cause them to reduce their aggregate equity ownership below 25%.

The Shareholders also have a general right of first offer before any Shareholder can transfer Shares to third
parties. In addition, if a party acquires more than 50% of the Shares, it must make an offer to purchase the remaining
Shares held by the Shareholders. Certain exceptions to this requirement apply to purchases by CAI Belgium, provided
that CAI Belgium is not controlled by a party that offers cable television or telephony services similar to those offered
by the Telenet group. CAI Belgium may also transfer its Shares to a separate entity whose securities it plans to offer
publicly. In such a situation, other Shareholders may also transfer their Shares to the separate entity and participate in
the public offering.

**Shareholder Registration Rights Agreement**

We have entered a registration rights agreement with the Shareholders of Telenet Group Holding, pursuant to
which Telenet Group Holding is obligated to conduct an initial public offering of its Shares upon the request of holders
of at least 10% of the then-outstanding Shares. The Shares subject to such offering are to be listed on an exchange in
the European Union or the United States that meets certain minimum requirements, including an average daily equity
float of at least U.S.$500 million during the prior 12 months. After an initial public offering, holders of 10% or more of
Shares that have not been sold may request Telenet Group Holding to conduct a secondary offering of their Shares,
provided that certain conditions are satisfied, including that the Shares to be offered have a market value of at least
U.S.$100 million.

**DESCRIPTION OF OTHER INDEBTEDNESS**

**Senior Credit Facility**

Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties, Telenet Vlaanderen and MixtICS, as borrowers, and Telenet Bidco, Telenet
Operaties, Telenet Vlaanderen, MixtICS, Telenet Holding and Merrion Communications, as guarantors, are party to a
credit agreement, originally dated July 12, 2002, with certain banks as lenders, Banca Monte Paschi Belgio S.A.,
European Investment Bank, GE Capital Structured Finance Group Limited, J.P. Morgan plc, KBC Bank NV, Lloyds
TSB Bank plc, Brussels Branch, Merrill Lynch International, NIB Capital Bank, Belgium Branch, The Royal Bank of
Scotland plc, Société Générale, WestLB AG and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. as mandated lead arrangers,
The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as facility agent and KBC Bank NV as security agent (as amended, the "Senior Credit
Facility").

The following is a summary of some of the provisions of the Senior Credit Facility, and is qualified in its
entirety by reference to the Senior Credit Facility and the other documents entered into in connection with it. We
recommend you refer to the actual Senior Credit Facility for further details, copies of which are available from the
Issuer upon request.

J.P. Morgan plc, Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P., Merrill Lynch International, The Royal Bank of
Scotland plc, KBC Bank NV, Société Générale and WestLB AG are mandated lead arrangers, principal lenders and
agents under the Senior Credit Facility, and JPMorgan Chase Bank has been engaged to coordinate certain
amendments to the terms of the Senior Credit Facility, including amendments related to the issuance of the Notes. Such
banks or their affiliates are the initial purchasers for this offering. As described under "Use of Proceeds," we intend to
use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility.

**_Structure_**

The Senior Credit Facility consists of the following facilities, after giving effect to the Refinancing:

      - the Tranche A Facility, which is an amortizing term loan and guarantee facility, of which [€405 million is]
currently outstanding;

      - the Tranche B Facility, which is a revolving credit facility of [€25] million that will convert on
January 31, 2004 to an amortizing term loan. [€25 million of the Tranche B Facility is currently]
outstanding;

      - the Tranche C-2 Facility, which is a non-amortizing term loan facility in an amount of up to
€150 million, of which €110 million is currently outstanding;

      - the Tranche D Facility, which is a revolving credit facility in an amount of up to [€100] million and which
is currently undrawn; and

      - the Tranche E Facility, a non-amortizing term loan facility, of which [€300 million is currently]
outstanding.

The Tranche C-2 Facility, of which [€40] million is currently undrawn, to Telenet Bidco and Telenet Operaties
until January 31, 2006, and can be applied toward the general corporate purposes of such borrowers. The Tranche D
Facility, which is available to Telenet Operaties and MixtICS until November 30, 2009, can be applied toward the
general corporate purposes of such borrowers, as envisaged in the approved business plan. No further drawings are
available under the Senior Credit Facility other than under the Tranche C-2 Facility and the Tranche D Facility.

We anticipate that, after giving effect to the Refinancing, approximately [€139] million of borrowings outstanding
under the Senior Credit Facility would be outstanding at Telenet Bidco, while the remaining [€ 701] million would be
outstanding at Telenet Operaties.

**_Tranche A Facility and Tranche B Facility_**

144


-----

The Tranche A Facility and the Tranche B Facility (after January 31, 2004) are amortizing term loan facilities.
The outstanding amount under these facilities is required to be repaid in full in the installments and on the dates
specified in the Senior Credit Facility, pursuant to an amortization schedule. However, prepayments, including those
that we propose to make with a portion of the proceeds of this offering of Notes, will result in an adjustment of that
amortization schedule. If the prepayments to be made from the proceeds of this offering of Notes were the only
prepayments of the Tranche A and Tranche B Facilities made prior to December 31, 2009, we would be required to
make the following repayments on the Tranche A and Tranche B Facilities pursuant to the Senior Credit Facility:

until November 30, 2009. The full amount of the Tranche D Facility is required to be repaid by December 31, 2009.

**_Tranche E Facility_**

The Tranche E Facility is a non-amortizing term loan facility which is available to Bidco and Operaties in the
same proportion that Bidco and Operaties respectively participate in the Tranche A Facility. The principal amount of
the Tranche E Facility is required to be repaid on December 31, 2009.

145


-----

**_Prepayment_**

In addition to the scheduled repayments described above, the Senior Credit Facility must be prepaid upon the
occurrence of certain events. For example, in certain circumstances, the Senior Credit Facility requires prepayments
from the net proceeds of asset sales, insurance claims (subject to _de minimus exceptions), certain percentages of_
issuances of additional debt or equity and 50% of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the Senior Credit Facility).

Indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility may be voluntarily prepaid by the borrowers in whole or in part
(but in a minimum amount of [€10 million), on giving at least five business days' prior notice to the facility agent, without]
premium or penalty (although prepayment fees are required for certain Tranche C-2 Facility and Tranche E Facility
prepayments) and subject to break funding costs if any such prepayment is not made on an interest payment date.

**_Interest Rate and Fees_**

Advances under the Tranche A Facility, the Tranche B Facility, the Tranche D Facility and the Tranche C-2
Facility bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR plus the applicable margin and plus any applicable reserve
asset costs. The applicable margins in relation to the Tranche A Facility, the Tranche B Facility and the Tranche D
Facility are 3.50% per annum until December 31, 2003 and then, subject to certain exceptions, range from 3.50% to
1.75% per annum, depending on a margin adjustment mechanism based on the ratio of Total Debt to Annualized
EBITDA (each as defined in the Senior Credit Facility) for the relevant period. The current margin for such facilities is
3.50% per annum. The applicable margin in relation to the Tranche C-2 Facility is 4.25% per annum.

Advances under the Tranche E Facility bear interest at rates per annum equal to EURIBOR plus the
applicable margin, which is 3.50% per annum, and plus any applicable reserve asset costs.

We are required to pay to the facility agent for each lender a commitment fee of the lower of: (i) 0.75% on the
daily amount equal to the undrawn and uncancelled amount of such lender's commitment under the Tranche B Facility
and Tranche D Facility, and (ii) 50% of the applicable margin on the undrawn and uncancelled amount of the Senior
Credit Facility. The commitment fee for the Tranche C-2 Facility is 1.25% on the daily amount equal to the undrawn
and uncancelled amount of such lender's commitment under the Tranche C-2 Facility. There is no commitment fee in
respect of the Tranche E Facility.

**_Guarantees and Security_**

Telenet Bidco and certain of its subsidiaries guarantee the obligations of the borrowers under the Senior Credit
Facility, to the extent permitted by law. All of the guarantors of the Notes (other than Telenet Group Holding) are also
guarantors pursuant to the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, MixtICS and Merrion Communications, which are not
guarantors of the Notes, are guarantors under the Senior Credit Facility. MixtICS does not guarantee any debt incurred
by Telenet Bidco under the Senior Credit Facility. In addition, the Senior Credit Facility requires under certain
circumstances additional material subsidiaries of Telenet Bidco to become guarantors under the Senior Credit Facility.

Security has been given by the guarantors under the Senior Credit Facility for the borrowers' obligations under
the Senior Credit Facility over substantially all their assets. Such security includes a cross-guarantee structure from all
the guarantors, a pledge of all shares of all members of the Telenet group (other than Telenet Group Holding and the
Issuer), an [€ 800] million mortgage by Telenet Operaties, Telenet Vlaanderen and MixtICS, a [€1.25] billion floating
charge and irrevocable mortgage and floating charge mandates by Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties, Telenet
Vlaanderen and MixtICS in favor of the lenders for an amount of [€ 450] million, pledges over bank accounts and
pledges, as appropriate, of all present and future receivables, and the subordination of all loans to Telenet Bidco,
Telenet Operaties, Telenet Vlaanderen or MixtICS from the Issuer and its direct or indirect parent entities. The entities
making such loans are required to pledge the resulting claims in favor of the Lenders.

Holders of the Notes will not be able to participate in the liquidation of the assets of the above guarantors to
the extent of the security over those assets that has been granted in favor of the lenders under the Senior Credit
Facility. Furthermore, the guarantees of the Notes may be released, including upon the sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of a subsidiary guarantor pursuant to enforcement of such security, subject to compliance with certain
provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to procedures to be followed in connection with enforcement sales.
See "Description of the Notes—Subsidiary Guarantees."

146


-----

**_Covenants_**

The Senior Credit Facility contains certain negative covenants, restricting the borrowers, the guarantors and
their respective subsidiaries from (subject to certain agreed exceptions), among other things:

      - creating or allowing to exist security interests over their assets;

      - entering into contractual arrangements on non-arm's length terms;

      - incurring indebtedness and guarantees (including loans to third parties);

      - engaging in mergers, consolidations and acquisitions and making investments;

      - disposing of assets and entering into sale/lease-back transactions;

      - paying management, technical and consulting fees to related parties;

      - changing their business and/or business plan;

      - amending or waiving of terms of the transaction documents; and

      - paying dividends and repurchasing shares.

The Senior Credit Facility also requires the borrowers, the guarantors and their respective subsidiaries to
observe certain customary covenants and representations, including covenants relating to legal status, regulatory
approvals, material licenses, compliance with laws, including environmental laws, litigation, financial statements,
ownership of assets and intellectual property rights, the ranking of obligations under the transaction documents relating
to the 2002 acquisition, insurance and payment of taxes.

In addition, the Senior Credit Facility requires the borrowers and guarantors to maintain specified consolidated
financial ratios of Net Senior Debt to Annualized EBITDA on a quarterly basis, Minimum Consolidated EBITDA to
Total Interest Payable, Net Total Debt to Annualized EBITDA, Annualized EBITDA to Estimated Total Debt Service
on a 12-month period basis, and, minimum Annualized EBITDA for the combined business on a 6-month period basis
(as each is defined in the Senior Credit Facility and calculated in accordance with Belgian GAAP). See "Annex B—
Summary of Certain Senior Credit Facility Covenants." Events beyond our and the borrowers' control can affect our
ability to comply with the financial covenants.

**_Events of Default_**

The Senior Credit Facility contains events of default customary for senior secured leveraged financings,
including non-payment of principal or interest thereunder, misrepresentation, breach of covenants, insolvency and
insolvency proceedings, unlawfulness or repudiation of the financing or transaction documents, cessation of business,
regulatory intervention or loss of material licenses or approvals, expropriation, cross default to other debt of the Group,
an event of default under the Notes, documentation held unenforceable, change in control or ownership, material
adverse change and audit qualification. In addition, an event of default will occur upon the termination of usage rights
granted to Telenet Vlaanderen by Interkabel Vlaanderen CVBA.

**Proceeds Loans**

The Issuer will loan approximately [€297 million of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to Telenet Bidco]
under the Bidco Proceeds Loan. Telenet Bidco, in turn, will loan approximately [€112] million of the proceeds of the
Bidco Proceeds Loan to Telenet Operaties under the Operaties Proceeds Loan. Telenet Operaties will loan
approximately [€102] million of the proceeds of the Operaties Proceeds Loan to MixtICS under the MixtICS Proceeds
Loan. Interest will accrue on the Bidco Proceeds Loan at a rate equal to the interest rate payable on the Notes plus a
small margin, with such adjustments as may be necessary to match any additional amounts due thereunder, or any
default interest, tax-gross-up or other amounts payable in respect of the Notes. Interest and other amounts payable on

147


-----

the Bidco Proceeds Loan will be payable on the date that is two business days prior to the date on which such amounts
are payable on the Notes. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Bidco Proceeds Loan is repayable
upon the repayment in full or in part of amounts due under the Notes, whether at maturity, on early redemption or upon
acceleration. Interest will accrue on the Operaties Proceeds Loan and MixtICS Proceeds Loan at a rate equal to the
interest rate (as adjusted) payable on the Bidco Proceeds Loan or Operaties Proceeds Loan, respectively, plus a small
margin and will be payable on the date that is two business days prior to the date on which interest is payable on the
Bidco Proceeds Loan or Operaties Proceeds Loan, respectively. The Operaties Proceeds Loan will be repayable when
the Bidco Proceeds Loan becomes repayable and the MixtICS Proceeds Loan will be repayable when the Operaties
Proceeds Loan becomes repayable.

In connection with the Refinancing, the terms of the Existing Intercompany Loan in an amount of
approximately [€103] million between the Issuer and Telenet Bidco will be amended to match the maturity and
repayment terms of the Notes and the terms of the remaining intercompany loans will be amended to take account of
the economic terms of the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan (as defined below).

**MixtICS Guarantee**

MixtICS will guarantee on an unsecured senior subordinated basis the obligations of Telenet Operaties to
Telenet Bidco under the Operaties Proceeds Loan. The amount of such guarantee will be limited to an amount not to
exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by MixtICS without rendering such guarantee voidable under
applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

**_General_**

To establish the relative rights of certain of their creditors under their financing arrangements, the Issuer,
Telenet Bidco and the other Subsidiary Guarantors, will enter into an intercreditor agreement (the "Intercreditor
Agreement") with the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility, The Bank of New York, as the trustee under the
indenture governing the Notes, the security agent for the holders of the Notes. The Intercreditor Agreement restricts,
among other things, the ability of each Subsidiary Guarantor:

      - if there is a payment default under the Senior Credit Facility or if there is an outstanding payment
blockage notice, to make payments on;

      - to grant security for;

      - to defease; or

      - otherwise to provide financial support in relation to

the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Proceeds Loans and the guarantee by MixtICS of the Operaties Proceeds Loan for so
long as any indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facility remains outstanding.

The postponement, subordination, blockage or prevention of payment on the Proceeds Loans is not a waiver by
the Issuer, Telenet Bidco or Telenet Operaties, as applicable, of its claims and other rights under the applicable
Proceeds Loan. Payments on the Proceeds Loans shall remain due and payable, and interest shall continue to accrue.

**_Payment Blockage_**

While a payment blockage is in effect, the Subsidiary Guarantors will not be permitted to make any payment in
respect of the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Proceeds Loans and MixtICS will not be permitted to make any payment
in respect of the MixtICS Proceeds Loan or its guarantee of the Operaties Proceeds Loan. A payment blockage notice
may be served and become outstanding if there is an event of default, other than a payment event of default, under the
Senior Credit Facility; _provided that a payment blockage notice is only permitted to be served on or before the date_
falling 45 days after the date on which notice of such event of default has been received by the facility agent under the

148


-----

Senior Credit Facility. A payment blockage notice will remain outstanding, unless cancelled, until:

      - 179 days after receipt by Telenet Bidco of such payment blockage notice;

      - the event of default under the Senior Credit Facility is no longer outstanding and continuing or has been
waived by the holders of 66[2]/3% of the outstanding loans under the Senior Credit Facility;

      - the expiration of any standstill period in existence on the date of the service of such payment blockage
notice; or

      - all amounts outstanding under the Senior Credit Facility are paid and the lenders no longer have any
obligations under the Senior Credit Facility.

Only one payment blockage notice is permitted to be served in any consecutive 360-day period, and only one blockage
notice is permitted to be served in respect of a particular event or circumstance.

**_Standstill on Enforcement_**

The Trustee under the indenture and the holders of Notes may bring an action to enforce the obligations of the
Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Notes and Subsidiary Guarantees and the security interest granted in
respect of the collateral securing the Notes and Subsidiary Guarantees. Enforcement in respect of the Notes against
the Issuer is not restricted by the Intercreditor Agreement. However, action may not be taken against the Subsidiary
Guarantors or to enforce the security interest in respect of the collateral securing the Notes and Subsidiary Guarantees,
and the Issuer and Telenet Bidco may not take any enforcement action in respect of the Proceeds Loans or the
guarantee of the Operaties Proceeds Loan by MixtICS, unless a default has occurred under the indenture governing
the Notes, the Trustee under the indenture has notified the facility agent under the Senior Credit Facility of such default
and:

      - holders of 66[2]/3% of the outstanding Senior Debt (as defined below) have consented to such
enforcement action;

      - any Senior Debt has been declared due and payable or due and payable on demand under the Senior
Credit Facility, or the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility have taken any action to enforce any
security interest or lien against a Subsidiary Guarantor or MixtICS;

      - an insolvency event has occurred in relation to a Subsidiary Guarantor or MixtICS;

      - a standstill period of 179 days has expired; or

      - a previously outstanding standstill period has expired.

For the purpose of this discussion of the Intercreditor Agreement, "Senior Debt" means obligations under the
Senior Credit Facility, hedging obligations contemplated by the Senior Credit Facility and obligations to the European
Investment Bank contemplated by the Senior Credit Facility.

**_Subordination on Insolvency_**

In the event of an insolvency of a Subsidiary Guarantor or MixtICS, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that
all obligations in respect of the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Proceeds Loans and the guarantee by MixtICS of the
Operaties Proceeds Loan will be subordinated to the prior payment in full of the Senior Debt, and any payments of any
kind, including by way of set-off or otherwise on the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Proceeds Loans and the guarantee by
MixtICS of the Operaties Proceeds Loan must be paid over to the creditors under the Senior Debt.

**_Turnover of Non-permitted Recoveries_**

In the event that, in contravention of the subordination terms described above or at a time when payments are
not permitted to be made:

149


-----

      - the Issuer or Telenet Bidco receives or recovers a payment or distribution, in cash or kind, in respect
of or on account of, or any other payment or distribution that is applied in respect of or on account of,
the Proceeds Loans; or

      - the Issuer, Telenet Bidco, the Trustee or any holder of a Note receives or recovers the proceeds of
any enforcement of any security, or payment under any Subsidiary Guarantee, or the guarantee by
MixtICS of the Operaties Proceeds Loan;

such person will hold the same as fiduciary agent in a segregated account and pay and distribute it to the creditors
under the Senior Debt (as their interests may appear) for application towards payment of the Senior Debt until the
Senior Debt is paid in full.

**_Enforcement Sales of Shares_**

The Intercreditor Agreement requires sales or other dispositions by the security agent for the Senior Credit
Facility of any shares of a Subsidiary Guarantor or MixtICS to be conducted:

      - in accordance with applicable Belgian law; and

      - except as described in the next sentence in accordance in all material respects with the procedures
recommended by an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm with respect to the
procedures to be used to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable for the shares to be sold or
disposed of given the then current condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business, assets and
prospects of Telenet Group Holding and its subsidiaries.

The Intercreditor Agreement requires the security agent under the Senior Credit Facility:

      - prior to conducting any sale or disposal referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph, to consult
with an internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm in regard to the procedures to be
used to obtain the best price reasonably obtainable in the circumstances for the shares to be sold or
disposed of given the then current condition (financial or otherwise), earnings, business, assets and
prospects of Telenet Bidco and its subsidiaries; and

      - to use its reasonable endeavors to procure that any court or other authority conducting such a sale or
disposal, implements in all material respects any procedures so recommended.

For the purposes of the above, reasonable endeavors will, to the extent permitted by Belgian law, include attempting to
conduct such sale or disposal process other than through a court or other legal proceeding. The Intercreditor
Agreement provides that if notwithstanding the reasonable endeavors of the security agent for the Senior Credit
Facility, the procedures referred to above are not implemented by the relevant court authority, such security agent shall
be excused from any further obligation to cause such procedures to be implemented by such authority.

**Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan**

The Issuer will use approximately [€102.6 million of the proceeds of the issuance of the Notes to repay certain]
existing intercompany loans from Telenet Group Holding to the Issuer. Following the repayment of these intercompany
loans, the terms of the remaining aggregate principal amount of intercompany loans (the "Junior Subordinated Parent
Intercompany Loan") will be amended to match the economic terms of the Senior Discount Note and be
redenominated in dollars, with an aggregate principal amount of $319.7 million. Subject to the terms of a subordination
agreement (the "Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Intercreditor Agreement") to be entered into on the
closing date by Telenet Group Holding, the Issuer, The Bank of New York, as Trustee, and the security agent for the
Notes, under the indenture governing the terms of the Notes, the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan will
be repayable upon the Senior Discount Notes becoming payable in accordance with their terms.

**Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Intercreditor Agreement**

150


-----

Telenet Group Holding and the Issuer, among others, will enter into the Junior Subordinated Parent
Intercompany Loan Intercreditor Agreement with The Bank of New York as trustee under the indenture and
JPMorgan Chase Bank as the Junior Security Agent. The Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Intercreditor
Agreement will restrict, subject to compliance with the covenant described under "Description of the Notes—Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Restricted Payments:"

      - the redemption or repurchase of the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan,

      - the Issuer or its subsidiaries securing or otherwise providing credit support for the Junior Subordinated
Parent Intercompany Loan,

      - any transfer of the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan and

      - any payments being made on the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan prior to the maturity
of the Notes.

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings involving the Issuer, the
Holders will be entitled to payment in full before Telenet Group Holding would be entitled to receive any payment on
the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan.

In addition, if Telenet Group Holding receives any distribution not provided for or permitted by the Junior
Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Intercreditor Agreement, Telenet Group Holding must pay over the
distribution to the Trustee under the indenture.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

Definitions of certain terms used in this Description of the Notes may be found under the heading "Certain
Definitions." For purposes of this section, the term (i) "Notes" refers to the Notes to be issued on the date as of which
the Indenture (as defined below) is dated (the "Closing Date") and any Additional Notes and (ii) "Parent" refers to
Telenet Group Holding (or any other company that shall be the direct parent company of the Issuer). Certain of the
Issuer's subsidiaries will guarantee the Notes and therefore will be subject to many of the provisions contained in this
Description of the Notes. Each subsidiary of the Issuer which guarantees the Notes is referred to in this section as a
"Subsidiary Guarantor." Each such guarantee is termed a "Subsidiary Guarantee."

The Issuer will issue the Notes under an Indenture, to be dated as of December 22, 2003 (the "Indenture"),
among Parent, the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors, The Bank of New York, as Trustee (the "Trustee") and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Junior Security Agent, a copy of which is available upon request to the Issuer. The
Indenture contains provisions which define your rights under the Notes. In addition, the Indenture governs the
obligations of the Issuer and of each Subsidiary Guarantor under the Notes.

The following description is meant to be only a summary of certain provisions of the Indenture. It does not
restate the terms of the Indenture in their entirety. We urge that you carefully read the Indenture as it, and not this
description, governs your rights as Holders.

**Overview of the Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees**

The Notes:

      - will be secured obligations of the Issuer;

      - will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer;

      - will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Obligations of the Issuer;

      - will be effectively subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries to the
extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness (other than to the extent such assets also
secure the Notes on an equal and ratable or priority basis); and

      - will be effectively subordinated to all liabilities (including Trade Payables) and Disqualified Stock and
Preferred Stock of each Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor.

The Notes will be Guaranteed by each of the following Subsidiaries of the Issuer:

      - Telenet Bidco,

      - Telenet Holding,

      - Telenet Operaties and

      - Telenet Vlaanderen.

The Subsidiary Guarantee of each Subsidiary Guarantor:

      - will be a general obligation of such Subsidiary Guarantor;

      - will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and future Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of
such Subsidiary Guarantor;

      - will be subordinated in right of payment to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary Guarantor;

153


-----

      - will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Obligations of such Subsidiary
Guarantor; and

      - will be effectively subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and its
Subsidiaries to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness (other than to the
extent such assets also secure such Subsidiary Guarantee on an equal and ratable or priority basis).

The Notes will not be Guaranteed by any other Subsidiary of the Issuer unless, subject to certain limitations,
any such Subsidiary Guarantees any other obligations of the Issuer or any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries. The Subsidiary
Guarantors of the Notes will consist of our principal operating subsidiaries, other than MixtICS, which provides our
cable television services. MixtICS will guarantee the Operaties Proceeds Loan, which will be pledged to secure the
Notes on a second priority basis. See "Description of Other Indebtedness—Proceeds Loans." As of and for the nine
months ended September 30, 2003, the Subsidiary Guarantors, together with the Issuer and Parent, would have
represented 63.9%, 61.9% and 50.6% of our total assets, revenue and EBITDA, respectively. MixtICS represents
most of the remainder of our assets, revenues and EBITDA. See "Annex C—Summary Guarantor Financial
Information." MixtICS is unable to Guarantee the Notes due to concerns relating to restrictions under Belgian law that
prohibit a Belgian company from assisting in financing an acquisition of its shares or the refinancing of Indebtedness
Incurred to finance an acquisition of its own shares.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Issuer will initially issue Notes in an aggregate principal amount of [€500] million. The Notes will mature on
December 15, 2013. The Issuer will issue the Notes in denominations of [€1,000 and any integral multiple of €1,000.]

Each Note we issue will bear interest at a rate of 9% per annum, beginning on December 22, 2003, or from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or provided for. The Issuer will pay interest semiannually to Holders
of record at the close of business on the June 1 or December 1 immediately preceding the interest payment date on
June 15 and December 15 of each year. The Issuer will begin paying interest to Holders on June 15, 2004. Interest
will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

**Indenture May Be Used For Future Issuances**

The Issuer may issue additional Notes having identical terms and conditions to the Notes it is currently offering
(the "Additional Notes") from time to time. The Issuer will only be permitted to issue such Additional Notes if at the
time of such issuance the Issuer and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture.
Any Additional Notes will be treated with the Notes as a single class and will vote on all matters with such Notes.

**Paying Agents and Registrar**

Payments in respect of any Global Note deposited with the operator of the X/N System (or with a depositary
therefor) shall be made through ING Belgium SA/NV (the "Principal Paying Agent") in accordance with the rules
applicable to the X/N System. The location of the Principal Paying Agent is Avenue Marnixlaan 24, B-1000 Brussels,
Belgium. Holders may exchange or transfer their Notes upon notification and certification given to the Principal Paying
Agent.

In the event that definitive registered Notes are issued, (a) the Issuer, or any agent designated by the Issuer to
perform such function, will act as registrar and (b) the Issuer will pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on,
the Notes at any of its offices or any agency designated by it which is located in the Borough of Manhattan, The City
of New York or in London, England. The Issuer may also designate additional offices or agents for the payment of the
principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, the Notes. The Issuer, however, reserves the right to pay interest to
Holders by check mailed directly to Holders at their registered addresses.

In the event that definitive registered Notes are issued, holders may exchange or transfer their Notes at the
same location given in the preceding paragraph. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or
exchange of Notes. We, however, may require Holders to pay any transfer tax or other similar governmental charge
payable in connection with any such transfer or exchange. See "Book-Entry, Form, Clearance and Settlement."

154


-----

Application has been made to list the Notes on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. So long as the Notes are
listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, a paying agent and transfer agent will be maintained in Luxembourg at all
times that payments are required to be made in respect of the Notes. The Issuer has initially designated The Bank of
New York (Luxembourg) SA to act as paying agent and transfer agent in Luxembourg. In the event that definitive
registered Notes are issued, a notice will be published in Luxembourg as set forth below. Distributions of interest on the
Notes in definitive registered form will be made to Holders of record at the close of business on the June 1 or
December 1 immediately preceding the interest payment date on June 15 and December 15 of each year. Holders
must surrender definitive registered Notes to the Luxembourg paying agent to collect payments of principal. Payments
shall be paid at the offices of the agent, although the Issuer reserves the right to pay interest to Holders by check
mailed directly to Holders at their registered addresses.

So long a the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require,
in the case of a transfer of definitive registered Notes, a Holder may effect such transfer by presenting and
surrendering such Notes at, and obtaining new definitive registered Notes from, the office of the Luxembourg transfer
agent. It is expected that, in the case of a transfer of only a part of a definitive registered Note, a new definitive
registered Note is respect of the balance of the principal amount of the definitive registered Note not transferred will
be delivered to the office of the Luxembourg transfer agent as appropriate. It is further expected that definitive
registered Notes that are mutilated, lost destroyed or wrongfully taken will be replaced by a new definitive registered
Note as provided in the Indenture and which may be obtained from the Luxembourg transfer agent. In addition, for so
long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such exchange so require, notices to
Holders will be validly given if published in a daily leading newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (expected
to be the Luxemburger Wort).

The Issuer will ensure that it maintains a paying agent in a Member State that will not be obliged to withhold or
deduct tax pursuant to Council Directive 2003/48/EC regarding the taxation of savings income.

**Optional Redemption**

Except as set forth in the following paragraphs or under the heading "Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons,"
the Issuer may not redeem the Notes prior to December 15, 2008. After this date, the Issuer may redeem the Notes, in
whole or in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice, at the following redemption prices (expressed
as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date (subject to
the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date),
if redeemed during the 12-month period commencing on December 15 of the years set forth below:

**Redemption**


**Redemption Year**


**Price**


2008................................................................................................................................................... 104.5%
2009................................................................................................................................................... 103.0%
2010................................................................................................................................................... 101.5%
2011 and thereafter ............................................................................................................................. 100.0%

The Issuer may also choose to redeem the Notes before December 15, 2008. If the Issuer does so, it may
redeem the Notes, in whole or in part, on not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' prior notice. To redeem the Notes,
the Issuer must pay a redemption price equal to the sum of:

(a) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed, plus

(b) the Applicable Premium,

plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

Prior to December 15, 2006, the Issuer may, on one or more occasions, also redeem up to a maximum of 35%

155


-----

of the original aggregate principal amount of the Notes (calculated giving effect to any issuance of Additional Notes)
with the Net Cash Proceeds of one or more Public Equity Offerings (1) by the Issuer or (2) by a Telenet Holding
Company to the extent the Net Cash Proceeds thereof are contributed in cash to the Issuer's equity (other than by the
issuance of Disqualified Stock) or used to purchase Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer from the
Issuer, in each case, following which there is a Public Market, at a redemption price equal to 109.0% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date (subject to the right of Holders
of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date); _provided,_
_however, that:_

(1) after giving effect to any such redemption at least 65% of the original aggregate principal amount of
the Notes (calculated giving effect to any issuance of Additional Notes) remains outstanding; and

(2) any such redemption by the Issuer must be made within 90 days of such Public Equity Offering and
must be made in accordance with certain procedures set forth in the Indenture.

**Payments of Additional Amounts**

All payments made under or with respect to the Notes shall be made free and clear of, and without withholding
or deduction for or on account of, any present or future tax, duty, levy, impost, assessment or other governmental
charge (including related penalties, interest and other liabilities) (hereinafter, "Taxes") imposed or levied by or on behalf
of the government of Belgium, Luxembourg or any political subdivision or any authority or agency therein or thereof
having power to tax, or any other jurisdiction in which the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor is organized or is
otherwise resident for tax purposes, or any jurisdiction from or through which payment is made (each, a "Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction"), unless the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor is required to withhold or deduct Taxes by law or
by the interpretation or administration thereof.

If the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor is so required to withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of
Taxes imposed by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction from any payment made under or with respect to the Notes, the
Issuer or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor shall pay such additional amounts ("Additional Amounts") as may be
necessary so that the net amount received by the Holders and beneficial owners (including Additional Amounts) after
such withholding or deduction will not be less than the amount the Holders and beneficial owners would have received
if such Taxes had not been withheld or deducted; _provided, however, that the foregoing obligation to pay Additional_
Amounts does not apply to:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder or beneficial owner (or between a fiduciary, settlor, member
or shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate,
nominee, trust or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (other than the mere receipt of
such payment or the ownership or holding of such Note),

(2) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property tax or similar tax, assessment or
other governmental charge,

(3) any Taxes which are payable otherwise than by withholding from payments of (or in respect of)
principal of, or any interest on, the Notes,

(4) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure to comply by the Holder or the
beneficial owner of a Note with a request by the Issuer addressed to the Holder or such beneficial
owner (A) to provide information concerning the nationality, residence or identity of the Holder or such
beneficial owner or (B) to make any declaration or other similar claim or satisfy any information or
reporting requirement, which, in the case of (A) or (B), is required or imposed by a statute, treaty,
regulation or administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption
from all or part of such Tax,

(5) any Taxes that are required to be withheld or deducted on a payment to an individual pursuant to
European Union Council Directive 2003/48/EC regarding the taxation of savings income or

156


-----

(6) any combination of items (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) above.

The Issuer or such Subsidiary Guarantor also will not be required to pay Additional Amounts:

(a) if the payment could have been made without deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the
payment had presented the Note for payment within 30 days after the date on which such payment or
such Note became due and payable or the date on which payment thereof is duly provided for,
whichever is later (except to the extent that such beneficiary would have been entitled to Additional
Amounts had the Note been presented on the last day of the 30-day period),

(b) with respect to any payment of principal of (or premium, if any, on) or interest on such Note to any
Holder who is a fiduciary or partnership or any Person other than the sole beneficial owner of such
payment, to the extent that a beneficiary or settlor with respect to such fiduciary, a member of such a
partnership or the beneficial owner of such payment would not have been entitled to the Additional
Amounts had such beneficiary, settlor, member or beneficial owner been the actual Holder of such
Note or

(c) if the Note is presented for payments by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner who would be
able to avoid a withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note to another paying agent in a
Member State.

If the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any
payment under or with respect to the Notes or the relevant Subsidiary Guarantee, as applicable, the Issuer or such
Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, will deliver to the Trustee at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless
the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to that payment date, in which case the Issuer
or the Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, shall notify the Trustee promptly thereafter) an Officers' Certificate stating
the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable. The Officers' Certificate must also set
forth any other information necessary to enable the paying agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders and beneficial
owners on the relevant payment date.

Upon request, the Issuer will provide the Trustee with official receipts or other documentation satisfactory to
the Trustee evidencing the payment of the Taxes with respect to which Additional Amounts are paid.

Whenever in this "Description of the Notes" there is mentioned, in any context:

      - the payment of principal,

      - purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes,

      - interest or

      - any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

that reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts provided for in this section to the extent that,
in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Issuer will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes or any other excise or property
taxes, charges or similar levies that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, enforcement or registration of
the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees, the Indenture or any other related document or instrument, or the receipt of any
payments with respect to the Notes or the Subsidiary Guarantees, excluding taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by
any jurisdiction outside of Luxembourg, Belgium, the jurisdiction of incorporation of any successor of the Issuer or any
jurisdiction in which a paying agent is located, and the Issuer will agree to indemnify the Holders or the Trustee for any
such taxes paid by the Holders or the Trustee.

The preceding provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and shall apply
_mutatis_ _mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Issuer is organized or any political_
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

157


-----

**Optional Redemption for Tax Reasons**

The Issuer may, at its option, redeem all, but not less than all, the then-outstanding Notes at any time upon
giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to the Holders (which notice shall be irrevocable), at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption
date (a "Tax Redemption Date") and all Additional Amounts, if any, that will become due on the Tax Redemption Date
as a result of such redemption or otherwise (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to
receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), if the Issuer determines that (1) on the occasion of the next
payment due in respect of the Notes, it would be required to pay Additional Amounts and (2) the payment obligation
cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it (including making payment through a paying
agent located in another jurisdiction), as a result of:

(A) any change in, or amendment to, the laws or treaties (or any regulations, protocols or rulings
promulgated thereunder) of Luxembourg or any other Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction affecting taxation,
which change or amendment becomes effective on or after the Closing Date,

(B) any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent jurisdiction),
which change, amendment, application or interpretation becomes effective on or after the Closing
Date, or

(C) the issuance of definitive Notes due to:

(i) the National Bank of Belgium ("NBB") ceasing to operate the X/N System or

(ii) the notification by each of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg that it is unwilling or
unable to continue to act as, or ceases to be, a clearing agency in respect of the Notes,

and, in either case under this clause (C), a successor is not able to be appointed by the Issuer within 120 days
of the notification. See "Book-Entry, Form, Clearance and Settlement."

The notice of redemption may not be given earlier than 120 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer
would be obligated to make a payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due. Prior to the
publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer
will deliver to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an opinion of an independent legal counsel of recognized
standing to the effect that the circumstances referred to above exist. The Trustee shall accept the Officers' Certificate
and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, in which event it
shall be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Redemption at Maturity**

On December 15, 2013, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or
purchased and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the
redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the
relevant interest payment date).

**Selection**

If the Issuer partially redeems the Notes, the Trustee will select the Notes to be redeemed on a pro rata basis,
by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion shall deem to be fair and appropriate. No Note of
€1,000 in original principal amount or less will be redeemed in part. If the Issuer redeems any Note in part only, the
notice of redemption relating to such Note shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. A
new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued in the name of the Holder thereof
upon cancelation of the original Note. On and after the redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on Notes or
portions thereof called for redemption so long as we have deposited with any paying agent funds sufficient to pay the
principal of, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, on the Notes to be redeemed.

158


-----

**Ranking**

The Notes will be Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer, will rank equally in right of payment with all existing and
future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated
Obligations of the Issuer. The Notes also will be effectively subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness of the Issuer
and its Subsidiaries to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness (other than to the extent that
such assets also secure the Notes on an equal and ratable basis).

The ability of the Issuer to service its indebtedness, including the Notes, is dependent upon the earnings of its
Subsidiaries and the ability of those Subsidiaries to distribute those earnings as dividends, loans or other payments to the
Issuer. In particular, the ability of its Subsidiaries to transfer funds to the Issuer (in the form of cash dividends, loans,
advances or otherwise) may be limited by financial assistance rules, corporate benefit laws, banking or other
regulations. For example, under company law (including the civil and commercial codes in Belgium), the Issuer's
Subsidiaries are generally prohibited from paying dividends except out of profits legally available for distribution. If
these restrictions are applied to the Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Subsidiary Guarantors, then the Issuer would
not be able to use the earnings of those Subsidiaries to make payments on the Notes to the extent that such earnings
cannot otherwise be paid lawfully to the Issuer (directly or through Subsidiaries of the Issuer).

The Subsidiary Guarantees will be Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor,
will be unsecured (except for the Subsidiary Guarantees of Telenet Bidco and Telenet Operaties, which will be secured
by second priority pledges of the shares of Telenet Operaties and MixtICS, respectively), will be subordinated in right
of payment to all existing and future Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, will rank equally in right of
payment with all existing and future Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor and will be senior
in right of payment to all existing and future Subordinated Obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor. The Subsidiary
Guarantees also will be effectively subordinated to any Secured Indebtedness of the applicable Subsidiary Guarantor
and its Subsidiaries to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Secured Indebtedness (other than to the
extent that such assets also secure the relevant Subsidiary Guarantee on an equal and ratable or priority basis).

The Issuer currently conducts all its operations through its Subsidiaries. To the extent such Subsidiaries are not
Subsidiary Guarantors, creditors, including trade creditors, and preferred shareholders, if any, of such Subsidiaries
generally will have priority with respect to the assets and earnings of such Subsidiaries over the claims of creditors of
the Issuer, including Holders. The Notes, therefore, will be effectively subordinated to the claims of creditors, including
trade creditors, and preferred shareholders, if any, of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that are not Subsidiary Guarantors
(other than, to the extent of the Operaties Proceeds Loan and the Mixt Proceeds Loan, MixtICS). As of September 30,
2003, after giving pro forma effect to the issuance of the Notes and the related refinancings described elsewhere in this
offering memorandum, substantially all the Consolidated Indebtedness of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries would have
been Incurred by the Subsidiary Guarantors and MixtICS.

Assuming that we had completed the issuance of the Notes and the related refinancings described elsewhere
in this offering memorandum as of September 30, 2003, there would have been outstanding:

(1) no Indebtedness of the Issuer, other than the Notes (exclusive of intercompany Indebtedness);

(2) the Subsidiary Guarantors would have had [€840] million of Senior Indebtedness under the Existing
Credit Facility (exclusive of undrawn facilities under the Existing Credit Facility), all of which would
have been Secured Indebtedness; and

(3) no Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantors (other than the Subsidiary
Guarantees) and no Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantors that is subordinate or junior in right of
payment to the Subsidiary Guarantees.

Although the Indenture will limit the Incurrence of Indebtedness by the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries,
such limitation is subject to a number of significant qualifications. The Issuer and its Subsidiaries may be able to Incur
substantial amounts of Indebtedness in certain circumstances. Such Indebtedness may be Senior Indebtedness. See
"Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness" below.

**Subsidiary Guarantees**

**_General_**

Each Subsidiary of the Issuer that is an obligor as of the Closing Date under the Existing Credit Facility (other
than MixtICS, Codenet NV, Codenet S.A., Phone-Plus SPRL, PayTVCo and Merrion Communications) and certain
future Subsidiaries of the Issuer (as described below) will jointly and severally irrevocably guarantee, as primary
obligors and not merely as sureties, on a senior subordinated basis the performance and full and punctual payment
when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture
(including obligations to the Trustee) and the Notes, whether for payment of principal of or interest on or in respect of
the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise (all such obligations being herein called the "Guaranteed
Obligations"). MixtICS will Guarantee the obligations of Telenet Operaties under the Operaties Proceeds Loan. See
"Description of Other Indebtedness—Proceeds Loans." The Subsidiary Guarantors will agree to pay, in addition to the
amount stated above, any and all costs and expenses (including counsel fees and expenses) properly incurred by the
Trustee or the Holders in enforcing any rights under the Subsidiary Guarantees. Each Subsidiary Guarantee will be
limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be Guaranteed by that Subsidiary Guarantor without
rendering the Subsidiary Guarantee, as it relates to such Subsidiary Guarantor, voidable under applicable law relating to
ultra vires, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors
generally.

The Issuer will cause each Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant Subsidiary and that Guarantees any other
obligations of the Issuer or any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries to become a Subsidiary Guarantor and, if applicable, execute
and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in the form set forth in the Indenture pursuant to which such
Restricted Subsidiary will Guarantee payment of the Notes; _provided, however, that (1) any Person that becomes a_
Restricted Subsidiary after the Closing Date will not be required to become a Subsidiary Guarantor for so long as the
Issuer is not, in the ordinary course, able to prepare or obtain financial statements (and related auditors' reports and
consents) of such Person that are required by applicable law, rule or regulation to be included in any required filing with
a legal or regulatory authority (provided that such Person shall not have otherwise Guaranteed any other Indebtedness
of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries other than Bank Indebtedness outstanding under Credit Facilities) and (2) no
Person that is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary will be required to become a Subsidiary Guarantor to the extent and
for so long as the issuance of such Subsidiary Guarantee (or any other Guarantee that would be required to be provided
as a consequence of the Incurrence of such Subsidiary Guarantee) would be reasonably likely to result in a violation of
applicable law or personal liability for any director or officer of such Subsidiary, in either case, that cannot be avoided
or otherwise prevented through measures reasonably available to the Issuer, any of its Subsidiaries or such Person.

Subject to the following paragraph, each Subsidiary Guarantee is a continuing guarantee and shall (a) remain in
full force and effect until payment in full of all the Guaranteed Obligations, (b) be binding upon each Subsidiary
Guarantor and its successors and (c) inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Trustee, the Holders and their
successors, transferees and assigns.

A Subsidiary Guarantor will automatically and unconditionally be released from all obligations under its
Subsidiary Guarantee, and such Subsidiary Guarantee shall thereupon terminate and be discharged and be of no further
force or effect,

(1) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor, concurrently with any sale or disposition (by merger,
consolidation or otherwise) of the Capital Stock of such Subsidiary Guarantor or any parent company
of such Subsidiary Guarantor, or of any interest therein, in each case following which such Subsidiary
Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary, or all or substantially all the assets of such Subsidiary
Guarantor, in each case so long as (A) any such sale or disposition is consummated in accordance with
the terms of the Indenture (including the covenants described under "Certain Covenants—Limitation
on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock" and "Merger and Consolidation") and (B) in the case of any
sale or disposition by way of enforcement of a security interest therein by a creditor of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary, such sale or disposition will also be required to be made in accordance with
applicable provisions of law and certain provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement (as described below)
(provided, _however, that any sale or disposition by a creditor under Senior Indebtedness of a_
Subsidiary Guarantor shall only be required to be in accordance with applicable provisions of law and
certain provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement),

160


-----

(2) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor that becomes a Subsidiary Guarantor pursuant to the
provisions relating to future Subsidiary Guarantors described above, at any time such Subsidiary
Guarantor is fully and unconditionally released from all the obligations that resulted in such Subsidiary
Guarantor being required to provide a Subsidiary Guarantee or

(3) upon legal or covenant defeasance of the Issuer's obligations or, subject to customary contingent
reinstatement provisions, satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture.

The Intercreditor Agreement will contain provisions that require the Senior Security Agent to consult with an
internationally recognized investment bank or accounting firm with respect to the procedures to be used to obtain the
best price reasonably obtainable for the shares of a Subsidiary Guarantor to be sold given the then-current condition
(financial or otherwise), earnings, business, assets and prospects of Telenet Bidco and its Subsidiaries and to cause to
be implemented in all material respects the procedures recommended by such firm in relation to such sale; _provided,_
_however, that if, notwithstanding the reasonable endeavours of the Senior Security Agent, such procedures are not_
implemented by the relevant court or other authority, the Senior Security Agent will be excused from any further
obligation to cause such procedures to be implemented by such authority; _provided,_ _further, that reasonable_
endeavours will, to the extent permitted by Belgian law, include attempting to conduct such sale process other than
through a court or legal proceeding. See "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement."

In addition, if we redesignate a Subsidiary Guarantor as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, which we can do under
certain circumstances, the redesignated Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from all its obligations under its
Subsidiary Guarantee.

Upon any such occurrence specified in the above paragraph, the Trustee will execute any documents
reasonably required in order to evidence such release, discharge and termination in respect of such Subsidiary
Guarantee.

Neither the Issuer nor any such Subsidiary Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to
reflect any such Subsidiary Guarantee or any such release, termination or discharge. In the event that a Subsidiary
Guarantor enters into a Subsidiary Guarantee or a Subsidiary Guarantor is released from its obligations under a
Subsidiary Guarantee at a time when the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, the Issuer will, to the
extent required by the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, publish notice of such Subsidiary Guarantee in a daily
leading newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (expected to be the _Luxemburger Wort), send a copy of_
such notice to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and deposit a copy of any new Subsidiary Guarantee with the
Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the Luxembourg Transfer Agent.

**_Subordination of Subsidiary Guarantees_**

_General_

The Subsidiary Guarantee of each Subsidiary Guarantor is a senior subordinated Guarantee, which means that
each such Subsidiary Guarantee ranks behind, and is expressly subordinated to, all the existing and future Senior
Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor, including any obligations owed by such Subsidiary Guarantor in respect of
Bank Indebtedness. The ability to take enforcement action against the Subsidiary Guarantors under their Subsidiary
Guarantees is subject to significant restrictions imposed by the Intercreditor Agreement.

_Limitations on Paying the Subsidiary Guarantees_

The Subsidiary Guarantors are not permitted to make any payment in respect of principal of, premium, if any,
or interest on the Notes and may not purchase, redeem or otherwise retire any Notes (collectively, "pay the Subsidiary
Guarantees") if a Senior Payment Default occurs unless such Senior Payment Default has been cured or waived and
any such acceleration has been rescinded or the Senior Indebtedness under which such Senior Payment Default
occurred has been paid in full in cash. Regardless of the foregoing, the Subsidiary Guarantors are permitted to pay the
Subsidiary Guarantees if the Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee receive written notice approving such payment
from the Representative of such Senior Indebtedness.

161


-----

During the continuance of any Senior Default (other than a Senior Payment Default), the Subsidiary
Guarantors are not permitted to pay the Subsidiary Guarantees for a period (a "Payment Blockage Period")
commencing upon the receipt by the Trustee of written notice (a "Blockage Notice") of such default from the
Representative under the Senior Indebtedness under which such Senior Default occurred specifying an election to
effect a Payment Blockage Period and ending 179 days thereafter; provided that a Blockage Notice is only permitted
to be served on or before the date falling 45 days after the date on which notice of a Senior Default (other than a
Senior Payment Default) has been received by such Representative. The Payment Blockage Period will end earlier if
such Payment Blockage Period is terminated:

(1) by written notice of the termination of such Blockage Notice to the Trustee and the Issuer from the
Person or Persons who gave such Blockage Notice;

(2) because the default giving rise to such Blockage Notice is cured, waived or otherwise no longer
continuing;

(3) because the Senior Indebtedness under which such Senior Default occurred has been discharged or
repaid in full in cash; or

(4) because of the expiry of any standstill period (as described below) in existence on the date of service
of the Blockage Notice.

Notwithstanding the provisions described above, unless the holders of such Senior Indebtedness or the
Representative of such Senior Indebtedness have accelerated the maturity thereof, the Subsidiary Guarantors will be
permitted to resume paying the Subsidiary Guarantees after the end of such Payment Blockage Period. The Subsidiary
Guarantees of the Subsidiary Guarantors shall not be subject to more than one Blockage Notice in any 360-day period
or in respect of the same event or circumstance.

_Standstill on Enforcement_

Enforcement by the Trustee and the Holders of the Subsidiary Guarantees is subject to the standstill provisions
described below. The commencement of a standstill period is triggered by an Event of Default under the Indenture and,
except as described in the following paragraph, will end on the 179[th] day following the date notice of such Event of
Default is delivered to the Representative under the Existing Credit Facility or certain other Senior Indebtedness. For
purposes of the standstill provisions, "enforcement" of a Subsidiary Guarantee consists of:

      - a demand for payment under such Subsidiary Guarantee;

      - any declaration that such Subsidiary Guarantee has become due;

      - taking any action for enforcing or otherwise recovering claims under such Subsidiary Guarantee or any
attachment, execution or initiation of insolvency proceedings; or

      - taking any other legally permissible action to exercise rights with respect to the claims under such
Subsidiary Guarantee;

_provided that the Trustee and the Holders may take certain actions necessary to preserve the validity and existence of_
their claims.

Notwithstanding the existence of a standstill period, but subject to the provisions described below under "—
Subordination on Insolvency," the Trustee and the Holders may take enforcement action with respect to the Subsidiary
Guarantees if:

      - the Majority Lenders have consented to the action;

      - action has been taken to enforce any security interests, guarantees or other collateral securing or
supporting Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor or MixtICS;

162


-----

      - an insolvency event occurs in relation to a Subsidiary Guarantor or MixtICS; or

      - a previously outstanding standstill period expires.

_Subordination on Insolvency_

In the event of a liquidation, dissolution, bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding involving the Issuer or any
of its Subsidiaries, in general:

      - creditors under the Existing Credit Facility and certain other Senior Indebtedness will be entitled
pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, to payment in full of all amounts outstanding
under such Senior Indebtedness before (1) the Holders would be entitled to payments under a
Subsidiary Guarantee of any Subsidiary Guarantor and (2) the Issuer would be entitled to payments
under the Bidco Proceeds Loan Agreement or the Existing Intercompany Loan Agreement and, as a
result, before holders of the Notes would ultimately receive any payments on the Notes;

      - the Holders will be required, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, to turnover any
amounts they receive in respect of a Subsidiary Guarantee of any Subsidiary Guarantor to the Senior
Security Agent until all outstanding Senior Indebtedness is paid in full; and

      - the Issuer will be required, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, to turnover any
amounts it receives under the Bidco Proceeds Loan Agreement or the Existing Intercompany Loan
Agreement to the Senior Security Agent until outstanding Senior Indebtedness is paid in full.

The Senior Security Agent will be directed to apply such amounts in the manner described under "—Turnover
and Application of Proceeds."

_Turnover and Application of Proceeds_

If at any time when any Senior Indebtedness of any Subsidiary Guarantor is or may be outstanding and any
such Subsidiary Guarantor makes any payment or distribution in cash or in kind on account of its Subsidiary Guarantee
when such payment or distribution is not permitted by the covenant described under "—Limitations on Paying the
Subsidiary Guarantees," then the Trustee or the Holder receiving such payment, as applicable, will be required to
turnover such amounts to the Senior Security Agent and such amounts shall be applied:

(1) first, in or towards payment of obligations under Senior Indebtedness;

(2) second (after discharge in full of such obligations under Senior Indebtedness), in or towards payment
of Senior Subordinated Indebtedness, including the Subsidiary Guarantees; and

(3) third (after discharge in full of such obligations under Senior Indebtedness and Senior Subordinated
Indebtedness), any surplus shall be paid to the Issuer.

Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, holders of Senior Indebtedness and other creditors
(including trade creditors) of a Subsidiary Guarantor may recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Notes
recover in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding relating to such Subsidiary Guarantor. This could apply even if the
applicable Subsidiary Guarantee ranked pari passu in right of payment with the other creditors' claims. In such a case,
there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining to pay the principal of or interest on the Notes.

Payment from the money or the proceeds of Government Obligations held in any defeasance trust pursuant to
the provisions described under "Defeasance" will not be subject to the subordination provisions described above.

See "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Financial Profile," "—Risks Relating to the Issuer and the
Intercompany Loans," "—Risks Relating to the Subsidiary Guarantees, Subsidiary Pledges and Belgian Law" and
"Description of Other Indebtedness."

**Security**

163


-----

**_General_**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture and the Subsidiary Guarantors under the
Subsidiary Guarantees will be secured as further described below by second priority pledges of (a) all the shares of
Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties and MixtICS and (b) receivables arising under the Proceeds Loan Agreements and
the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Agreement. This security will be granted in favor of the Junior
Security Agent in its capacity as joint creditor, together with the Holders, of all obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes and the Indenture and of the Subsidiary Guarantors under the Subsidiary Guarantees. Neither the Holders, nor
the Trustee, will have a direct security interest in the Collateral, nor will they be entitled to take enforcement action in
respect of the security, except through the Junior Security Agent, which has agreed to apply any proceeds of the
enforcement of the security towards such obligations. The Junior Security Agent will agree with the Trustee that the
Junior Security Agent will hold the security and any proceeds of the security in trust for the benefit of the Holders and
the Trustee. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Subsidiary Guarantees, Pledges and Belgian Law—The share
pledges and pledges of receivables will not be granted directly to the holders of the Notes."

Furthermore, subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenants described under "Certain
Covenants—Impairment of Security Interest" and "—Limitation on Liens," additional Indebtedness will be permitted to
be secured by pledges of the shares of Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties and MixtICS and receivables under thenexisting Proceeds Loan Agreements and the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Agreement that are
pledged to secure obligations under the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees and the Indenture. Under these
circumstances, creditors under such Indebtedness will share (on the basis described below) in the security for the
Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees and the Indenture and the Junior Security Agent as joint creditor will share in a
pledge of receivables arising under any Additional Proceeds Loan Agreements pledged to secure such Indebtedness.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority between (a) the holders of outstanding Bank Indebtedness under the Existing Credit
Facility and certain other Senior Indebtedness and (b) the Junior Security Agent as joint creditor together with the
Holders with respect to the security interests created by the Share Pledges and the Proceeds Loan Agreement Pledges
is established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, which provides that:

(1) the obligations under such Senior Indebtedness will be secured by a first priority interest in the
Collateral; and

(2) the obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the Subsidiary Guarantees will be secured by a
second priority interest in the Collateral.

See "—Enforcement of Security" and "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement."

**_Share Pledges_**

The holders of the issued share capital of Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties and MixtICS and the Junior
Security Agent will enter into the Share Pledges, under which all the shares of Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties and
MixtICS will be pledged on a second priority basis to the Junior Security Agent as joint creditor as described above.
There will be three share pledge agreements, one between each shareholder of Telenet Bidco and the Junior Security
Agent with respect to the shares of Telenet Bidco, one between each shareholder of Telenet Operaties and the Junior
Security Agent with respect to the shares of Telenet Operaties and one between each shareholder of MixtICS and the
Junior Security Agent with respect to the shares of MixtICS. Copies of each of these agreements will be available free
of charge from the Luxembourg paying agent as described under "Listing and General Information."

The Indenture will provide that, except in the event of a sale of shares that are subject to a Share Pledge by
the Senior Security Agent in accordance with certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, obligations under the
Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees and the Indenture will be secured by a second priority interest in the shares that are
subject to the Share Pledges until all obligations under the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees and the Indenture have
been discharged in full. However, see "Risk Factors—Risks Relating to the Subsidiary Guarantees, Pledges and
Belgian Law."

164


-----

A Share Pledge will be released in the event that, and for so long as, the holders of Senior Indebtedness
release their lien on the shares of Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties or MixtICS, as applicable, or following the
consummation of a sale or other disposition of the share capital of Telenet Bidco, Telenet Operaties or MixtICS, as
applicable, by the Senior Security Agent in accordance with certain provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating
to procedures to be followed in connection with enforcement sales. In addition, the Share Pledge relating to the shares
of MixtICS will be released upon a merger of MixtICS with Telenet Operaties in accordance with the Indenture.

**_Loan Agreement Pledges_**

The obligations under the Notes, the Indenture and the Subsidiary Guarantees also will be secured by a second
priority pledge of all receivables (all amounts payable under the Bidco Proceeds Loan Agreement, the Operaties
Proceeds Loan Agreement and the MixtICS Loan Agreement) arising under the Bidco Proceeds Loan Agreement, the
Operaties Proceeds Loan Agreement, the MixtICS Proceeds Loan Agreement and a portion of the receivables arising
under the Existing Intercompany Loan Agreement and a first priority pledge of all receivables arising under the Junior
Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Agreement. The pledges of receivables under these Proceeds Loan
Agreement Pledges have been granted in favor of the Junior Security Agent as joint creditor as described above. The
Proceeds Loan Agreements and the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Agreement will be governed by
Belgian law. There will be a receivables pledge agreement with respect to the receivables arising under each of the
Bidco Proceeds Loan, the Existing Intercompany Loan, the Operaties Proceeds Loan, the MixtICS Proceeds Loan and
a receivables pledge agreement with respect to receivables arising under the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany
Loan. A copy of this agreement will be available free of charge from the Luxembourg paying agent as described under
"Listing and General Information."

In the event that the lenders under the Existing Credit Facility enforce their first priority security interest with
respect to receivables arising under a Proceeds Loan Agreement, the Issuer's rights under the Bidco Proceeds Loan
Agreement and/or the Existing Intercompany Loan Agreement, Telenet Bidco's rights under the Operaties Proceeds
Loan Agreement and Telenet Operaties' rights under the MixtICS Proceeds Loan Agreement may be assigned to a
third party. This would mean that the Issuer would have no right, title or interest under the Bidco Proceeds Loan
Agreement and/or the Existing Intercompany Loan Agreement or claims against Telenet Bidco thereunder, Telenet
Bidco would have no right, title or interest under the Operaties Proceeds Loan Agreement or claims against Telenet
Operaties thereunder and Telenet Operaties would have no right, title or interest under the MixtICS Proceeds Loan
Agreement or claims against MixtICS thereunder.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

The Intercreditor Agreement restricts the ability of the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors to make certain
payments on, grant security for or provide other financial support in relation to, the Notes and the Subsidiary
Guarantees for so long as Bank Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility and certain other Senior Indebtedness
remain outstanding.

The Junior Security Agent will not be entitled to take any enforcement action under the Share Pledges and the
Proceeds Loan Agreement Pledges after the occurrence of an Event of Default or any other event that would cause
the Notes to become due and payable unless the Trustee has given its prior written consent to such enforcement action
and:

(1) all amounts outstanding under such Senior Indebtedness have been unconditionally repaid in full; or

(2) the relevant standstill period (as described under the heading "Subsidiary Guarantees—Subordination
of Subsidiary Guarantees—Standstill on Enforcement") has expired.

See "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement."

If the Trustee or any Holder receives proceeds of any enforcement of a Security Agreement while the
obligations under such Senior Indebtedness are outstanding, the Trustee or such Holder, as applicable, will turnover
such amounts to the Senior Security Agent to be applied in the order described under "Subsidiary Guarantees—
Subordination of Subsidiary Guarantees—Turnover and Application of Proceeds."

165


-----

**Par Offer**

In the event that the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors do not apply at least [€100 million of the net cash]
proceeds of the issuance and sale of the Notes within 120 days after the Closing Date to permanently prepay or repay
Bank Indebtedness of Telenet Bidco or Telenet Operaties under the Existing Credit Facility outstanding on the Closing
Date and treated as Incurred under clause (3) of paragraph (b) of the covenant described under "Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Indebtedness" (but excluding repayments of Bank Indebtedness made on the Closing Date), the Issuer
will be required to purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by the Issuer for the Notes (a "Par Offer"), which Par
Offer shall be in the amount of such net cash proceeds that are not so used, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the purchase date (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), in
accordance with the procedures (including prorating in the event of over-subscription) set forth in the Indenture. To the
extent that any portion of the amount of such net cash proceeds remains after compliance with the preceding sentence,
the Issuer will apply the remaining net cash proceeds for any general corporate purpose permitted by the terms of the
Indenture. The Issuer will not be required to make a Par Offer for Notes pursuant to this covenant if the amount of
such net cash proceeds available therefor is less than [€10] million. The Issuer will comply with the requirements of
Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any applicable securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase
of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with
provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be
deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant by virtue thereof. The Indenture will provide that the
Issuer will be required to loan (pursuant to the Bidco Proceeds Loan Agreement) to Telenet Bidco any amount which
will be used to repay Bank Indebtedness for purposes of this covenant and that Telenet Bidco will, in turn, be required
to loan such amount to Telenet Operaties (pursuant to the Operaties Proceeds Loan Agreement, in each case, prior to
the repayment of such Bank Indebtedness).

**Change of Control**

Upon the occurrence of any of the following events (each a "Change of Control"), each Holder will have the
right to require the Issuer to purchase all or any part of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101%
of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of purchase (subject to the
right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date);
_provided, however, that notwithstanding the occurrence of a Change of Control, the Issuer shall not be obligated to_
purchase the Notes pursuant to this section in the event that it has exercised its right to redeem all the Notes under the
terms of the section titled "Optional Redemption":

(1) any "person" (as such term is used in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes the
"beneficial owner" (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Exchange Act, except that for
purposes of this clause (1) such person shall be deemed to have "beneficial ownership" of all shares
that any such other person has the right to acquire, whether such right is exercisable immediately or
only after the passage of time), directly or indirectly, of more than 50% of the total voting power of the
Voting Stock of Parent or the Issuer (for the purposes of this clause (1), such person shall be deemed
to beneficially own any Voting Stock of an entity held by any other entity (the "parent entity"), if such
other person is the beneficial owner (as defined in this clause (1)), directly or indirectly, of more than
50% of the voting power of the Voting Stock of such parent entity);

(2) following the first Public Equity Offering following which there is a Public Market, during any period of
two consecutive years, individuals who at the beginning of such period constituted the board of
directors of Parent or the Issuer (together with any new directors whose election by such board of
directors of Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, or whose nomination for election by the shareholders of
Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, was approved by a vote of a majority of the directors of Parent or
the Issuer, as applicable, then still in office who were either directors at the beginning of such period or
whose election or nomination for election was previously so approved) cease for any reason to
constitute a majority of the board of directors of Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, then in office;

(3) the adoption of a plan relating to the liquidation or dissolution of Parent or the Issuer; or

166


-----

(4) the merger or consolidation of Parent or the Issuer with or into another Person or the merger of
another Person with or into Parent or the Issuer or the sale of all or substantially all the assets of
Parent or the Issuer to another Person, and, in the case of any such merger or consolidation, the
securities of Parent or the Issuer, as applicable, that are outstanding immediately prior to such
transaction and which represent 100% of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock of Parent or
the Issuer, as applicable, are changed into or exchanged for cash, securities or property, unless
pursuant to such transaction such securities are changed into or exchanged for, in addition to any other
consideration, securities of the surviving Person or transferee that represent immediately after such
transaction, at least a majority of the aggregate voting power of the Voting Stock of the surviving
Person or transferee.

In the event that at the time of such Change of Control the terms of the Bank Indebtedness restrict or prohibit
the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant, then prior to the mailing of the notice to Holders provided for in the
immediately following paragraph but, in any event, within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer shall, or
shall cause the applicable Restricted Subsidiary to:

(1) repay in full all Bank Indebtedness or, if doing so will allow the purchase of Notes, offer to repay in full
all Bank Indebtedness and repay the Bank Indebtedness of each lender who has accepted such offer,
or

(2) obtain the requisite consent under the agreements governing the Bank Indebtedness to permit the
repurchase of the Notes as provided for in the immediately following paragraph.

Within 30 days following any Change of Control, the Issuer shall mail a notice to each Holder with a copy to
the Trustee (the "Change of Control Offer") stating:

(1) that a Change of Control has occurred and that such Holder has the right to require the Issuer to
purchase all or a portion of such Holder's Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the date of purchase
(subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest on the relevant
interest payment date);

(2) the circumstances and relevant facts and financial information regarding such Change of Control;

(3) the purchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the date such
notice is mailed); and

(4) the instructions determined by the Issuer, consistent with this covenant, that a Holder must follow in
order to have its Notes purchased.

The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if a third party
makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set
forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases all Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any applicable
securities laws or regulations in connection with the purchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with the
applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this covenant
by virtue thereof.

The Change of Control purchase feature is a result of negotiations between the Issuer and the Initial
Purchasers. Management of the Issuer has no present intention to engage in a transaction involving a Change of
Control, although it is possible that they would decide to do so in the future. Subject to the limitations discussed below,
the Issuer could, in the future, enter into certain transactions, including acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations,
that would not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture, but that could increase the amount of indebtedness
outstanding at such time or otherwise affect the Issuer's capital structure or credit ratings. Restrictions on the ability of

167


-----

the Issuer to Incur additional Indebtedness are contained in the covenants described under "Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Indebtedness," "Certain Covenants—Limitation on Liens" and "Certain Covenants—Limitation on
Sale/Leaseback Transactions." Such restrictions can only be waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. Except for the limitations contained in such covenants, however, the
Indenture will not contain any covenants or provisions that may afford Holders protection in the event of a highly
leveraged transaction.

The occurrence of certain of the events which would constitute a Change of Control would constitute a default
under the agreement governing the Existing Credit Facility. Future Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries may contain prohibitions with respect to certain events which would constitute a Change of Control or
require such Senior Indebtedness to be repurchased or repaid upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the
Holders of their right to require the Issuer to purchase the Notes could cause a default under such Senior Indebtedness,
even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the Issuer. Finally, the
Issuer's ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a purchase may be limited by the Issuer's then existing financial
resources. Sufficient funds may not be available when necessary to make any required purchases. The provisions
under the Indenture relative to the Issuer's obligation to make an offer to purchase the Notes as a result of a Change of
Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the
Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain covenants including, among others, the following:

_Limitation on Indebtedness. (a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, Incur,_
directly or indirectly, any Indebtedness; _provided, however, that (1) the Issuer may Incur Indebtedness and (2) any_
Restricted Subsidiary may Incur Bank Indebtedness, in either case, if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving
effect thereto the Leverage Ratio of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries (on a Consolidated basis) would not
exceed 6.0:1.0.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph (a), the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur the
following Indebtedness:

(1) Bank Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility; _provided that the aggregate principal_
amount of all Bank Indebtedness at any one time outstanding pursuant to this clause (b)(1) shall not
exceed [€880] million, which amount shall be permanently reduced by the amount of Net Available Cash
used to prepay, repay, purchase, repurchase, redeem, retire, defease or otherwise acquire for value
Bank Indebtedness, except to the extent Bank Indebtedness is subsequently Incurred in an amount not
exceeding such amount of Net Available Cash and reinvested in Additional Assets or used to purchase
Notes or prepay, repay, purchase, repurchase, redeem, retire, defease or otherwise acquire for value
other Indebtedness, pursuant to the covenant described under "—Limitation on Sales of Assets and
Subsidiary Stock;"

(2) Indebtedness of the Issuer owed to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or
Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary owed to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided, however, that (A) any subsequent issuance or transfer of any Capital Stock or any other_
event that results in any such Restricted Subsidiary ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary or any
subsequent transfer of any such Indebtedness (except to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) shall be
deemed, in each case, to constitute the Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the issuer thereof, (B) if
the Issuer is the obligor on such Indebtedness, such Indebtedness is expressly subordinated for the
benefit of the Holders to the prior payment in full in cash of all obligations with respect to the Notes
and (C) if a Subsidiary Guarantor is the obligor on such Indebtedness and such Indebtedness is owed
to and held by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor, such
Indebtedness is expressly subordinated for the benefit of the Holders to the prior payment in full in
cash of all obligations of such Subsidiary Guarantor with respect to its Subsidiary Guarantee;

(3) Indebtedness (A) represented by the Notes (not including any Additional Notes) and the Subsidiary
Guarantees, (B) outstanding on the Closing Date (other than the Indebtedness described in clause

168


-----

(2) of this paragraph (b)) or (C) consisting of Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any
Indebtedness described in this clause (3) (including Indebtedness that is Refinancing Indebtedness) or
the foregoing paragraph (a); provided, however, that Bank Indebtedness outstanding on the Closing
Date shall not be Refinanced pursuant to this clause (C);

(4) (A) Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary Incurred and outstanding on or prior to the date on which
such Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary (other than
Indebtedness Incurred in contemplation of, in connection with, as consideration in, or to provide all or
any portion of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate, the transaction or series of related
transactions pursuant to which such Restricted Subsidiary became a Subsidiary of or was otherwise
acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary); _provided,_ _however, that on the date that such_
Restricted Subsidiary is acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, the Issuer would have been
able to Incur [€1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the foregoing paragraph] (a) after giving
effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (4) and (B) Refinancing
Indebtedness Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary in respect of Indebtedness Incurred by such
Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to this clause (4);

(5) Indebtedness (A) in respect of performance, bid, completion, surety or appeal bonds provided by the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of their business and (B) under Interest
Rate Agreements and Currency Agreements entered into for _bona fide hedging purposes of the_
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business; provided, however, that such
Interest Rate Agreements and Currency Agreements do not increase the Indebtedness of the Issuer
outstanding at any time other than as a result of fluctuations in interest rates or exchange rates of
currencies, as applicable, or by reason of fees, indemnities and compensation payable thereunder;

(6) (A) Purchase Money Indebtedness and Capitalized Lease Obligations Incurred for the purpose of
financing all or any part of the purchase price or cost of construction or improvement (including the
cost of design, development, construction, acquisition, transportation, installation, improvement and
migration) of assets used in a Permitted Business; and (B) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in
respect of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (6) (A); _provided, however, that the aggregate_
principal amount of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (6) shall not exceed [€50] million at
any time outstanding;

(7) the Guarantee by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of any Indebtedness of the Issuer or another
Restricted Subsidiary (excluding Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (6) or (11) of this
paragraph (b) or by the Issuer pursuant to clause (3)(B) (or, with respect to any Refinancing of such
Indebtedness, clause (3)(C)) of this paragraph (b); _provided,_ _however, that any Guarantee by a_
Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than a Guarantee of Bank Indebtedness)
shall be subordinated to at least the same extent that the Subsidiary Guarantees are subordinated to
Senior Indebtedness of the Subsidiary Guarantors; _provided,_ _further,_ _however, that with respect to_
Guarantees of Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to clause (2) of this paragraph (b), such Guarantee will
be on the same terms and subject to the same limitations as the Guaranteed Indebtedness;

(8) Indebtedness of the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries arising from the honoring by a bank or
other financial institution of a check, draft or similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the
ordinary course of business; _provided,_ _however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five_
Business Days of its Incurrence;

(9) Indebtedness constituting reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit, bankers'
acceptances or other similar instruments or obligations issued in the ordinary course of business,
including letters of credit in respect of workers' compensation claims or other Indebtedness Incurred
with respect to reimbursement-type obligations regarding workers' compensation claims and under
other similar legislation, and not, in any such case, in connection with the borrowing of money or the
obtaining of any advance of credit; provided that, upon the drawing or other funding of such letters of
credit or other instruments or obligations, such drawings or fundings are reimbursed within 30 days;

(10) Indebtedness arising from agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary providing for

169


-----

indemnification, adjustment of purchase price or similar obligations, in each case, Incurred in
connection with the disposition of any business, assets or Capital Stock of a Subsidiary, other than
Guarantees or other credit support of Indebtedness or other obligations of any Person acquiring all or
any portion of such business, assets or Capital Stock or any Affiliate of such Person; provided that:

(A) such Indebtedness is not reflected on the balance sheet of the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary (contingent obligations referred to in a footnote to financial statements and not
otherwise reflected on the balance sheet will be deemed not to be reflected on such balance
sheet for purposes of this clause (10)(A)); and

(B) the maximum liability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such
Indebtedness shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the Fair Market Value of
non-cash consideration (measured at the time the definitive agreement pursuant to which such
disposition is to be effected is entered into and without giving effect to any subsequent
changes in value), agreed by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries or retained or escrowed
in connection with such disposition;

(11) Permitted Shareholder Funding Incurred by the Issuer; and

(12) Indebtedness (other than Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the foregoing
paragraph (a) or any other clause of this paragraph (b)) in an aggregate principal amount on the date
of Incurrence that, when added to all other Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to this clause (12) and then
outstanding, will not exceed [€50] million.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1) the Issuer will not, and will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor to,
Incur any Indebtedness pursuant to paragraph (b) above if the proceeds thereof are used, directly or indirectly, to
repay, prepay, redeem, defease, retire, refund or refinance any Subordinated Obligations unless such Indebtedness will
be subordinated to the Notes or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantee, as applicable, to at least the same extent as such
Subordinated Obligations and (2) the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor
to Incur any Indebtedness pursuant to paragraph (b) above if the proceeds thereof are used, directly or indirectly, to
Refinance any Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor (unless the Indebtedness being Refinanced is
Bank Indebtedness permitted to be Incurred under the Indenture).

(d) For purposes of determining the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to this covenant:

(1) Bank Indebtedness Incurred prior to or on the Closing Date shall be treated as Incurred pursuant to
clause (1) of paragraph (b) above to the extent of the amount of such clause, and any excess Bank
Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility outstanding on the Closing Date shall be treated as
Incurred pursuant to clause (3) of paragraph (b) above,

(2) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one provision
permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one or
more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness,

(3) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, shall classify such Indebtedness and only be
required to include the amount of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and

(4) the outstanding principal amount of any particular Indebtedness shall be counted only once and any
obligations arising under any Guarantee, Lien, letter of credit or similar instrument supporting such
Indebtedness shall not be double counted.

For the purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness where
Indebtedness is denominated in a currency other than euros, the amount of such Indebtedness will be the Euro
Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; _provided,_ _however, that if any such Indebtedness that is_
denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to euros covering principal

170


-----

amounts payable on such Indebtedness, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euros will be adjusted to take
into account the effect of such Currency Agreement. The principal amount of any Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred
pursuant to paragraph (b) above Incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being Refinanced will be the Euro
Equivalent of the Indebtedness Refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness being Refinanced was initially
Incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted
Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded, with respect to outstanding
Indebtedness, due solely to the result of fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies.

_Anti-Layering. A Subsidiary Guarantor may not Incur any Indebtedness if such Indebtedness is by its terms_
expressly subordinate or junior in ranking in any respect to any Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor
unless such Indebtedness is Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor or is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to Senior Subordinated Indebtedness of such Subsidiary Guarantor. In addition, a
Subsidiary Guarantor may not Incur any Secured Indebtedness that is not Senior Indebtedness of such Subsidiary
Guarantor (except to the extent such Indebtedness is secured only by a Lien arising solely by operation of applicable
law) unless contemporaneously therewith effective provision is made to secure the Subsidiary Guarantee of such
Subsidiary Guarantor equally and ratably with (or on a senior basis to, in the case of Indebtedness subordinated in right
of payment to such Subsidiary Guarantee) such Secured Indebtedness for as long as such Secured Indebtedness is
secured by a Lien.

_Limitation on Restricted Payments. (a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary,_
directly or indirectly, to:

(1) declare or pay any dividend, make any distribution on or in respect of its Capital Stock or make any
similar payment (including any payment in connection with any merger or consolidation involving the
Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer) to the direct or indirect holders of its Capital Stock, except
(x) dividends or distributions payable solely in its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock or
Preferred Stock) and (y) dividends or distributions payable to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
(and, if such Restricted Subsidiary has shareholders other than the Issuer or other Restricted
Subsidiaries, to its other shareholders on a basis that is no more favorable to such other shareholders
than a pro rata basis),

(2) purchase, repurchase, redeem, retire or otherwise acquire for value any Capital Stock of the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary held by Persons other than the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,

(3) purchase, repurchase, redeem, retire, defease or otherwise acquire for value, prior to scheduled
maturity, scheduled repayment or scheduled sinking fund payment any Subordinated Obligations (other
than the purchase, repurchase redemption, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition for value of
Subordinated Obligations acquired in anticipation of satisfying a sinking fund obligation, principal
installment or final maturity, in each case, due within one year of the date of acquisition), or

(4) make any Investment (other than a Permitted Investment) in any Person (any such dividend,
distribution, payment, purchase, redemption, repurchase, defeasance, retirement, or other acquisition or
Investment being herein referred to as a "Restricted Payment"), if at the time the Issuer or such
Restricted Subsidiary makes such Restricted Payment:

(A) a Default will have occurred and be continuing (or would result therefrom);

(B) the Issuer could not Incur at least [€1.00 of additional Indebtedness under paragraph] (a) of the
covenant described under "—Limitation on Indebtedness;" or

(C) the aggregate amount of such Restricted Payment and all other Restricted Payments (the
amount so expended, if other than in cash, to be determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors, whose determination will be conclusive and evidenced by a resolution of the Board
of Directors) declared or made subsequent to the Closing Date would exceed the sum, without
duplication, of:

(i) 50% of the Consolidated Net Income accrued during the period (treated as one

171


-----

accounting period) from the beginning of the fiscal quarter immediately following the
fiscal quarter during which the Closing Date occurs to the end of the most recent
fiscal quarter ending at least 45 days prior to the date of such Restricted Payment (or,
in case such Consolidated Net Income will be a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit);

(ii) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds received by the Issuer from the issue or sale of its
Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) subsequent to the Closing Date (other
than an issuance or sale to (x) a Subsidiary of the Issuer or (y) an employee share
ownership plan or other trust to the extent funded by the Issuer or any of its
Subsidiaries);

(iii) the amount by which Indebtedness of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries is
reduced on the Issuer's balance sheet upon the conversion or exchange (other than by
a Subsidiary of the Issuer) subsequent to the Closing Date of any Indebtedness of the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries issued after the Closing Date which is convertible
or exchangeable for Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer (less
the amount of any cash or the Fair Market Value of other property distributed by the
Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary upon such conversion or exchange);

(iv) the amount equal to the net reduction in Investments after the Closing Date (other
than Permitted Investments) made by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary in any
Person (other than an Unrestricted Subsidiary) resulting from repurchases,
repayments, redemptions or releases of such Investments in such Person and
proceeds realized on the sale or liquidation of such Investment (excluding dividends
and distributions), in each case received by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
(except in the case of Investments that are Guarantees) in cash less the cost of such
repurchase, repayment, redemption, release, sale or liquidation of such Investment;
_provided, however, that such amount shall not exceed, in the case of any Person, the_
amount of Investments (excluding Permitted Investments) previously made (and
treated as a Restricted Payment) by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Person, which amount was included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted
Payments; and

(v) the amount equal to the net reduction in Investments in Unrestricted Subsidiaries
resulting from (x) payments of dividends, repayments of the principal of loans or
advances or other transfers of assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from
Unrestricted Subsidiaries or (y) the redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as
Restricted Subsidiaries (valued in each case as provided in the definition of
"Investment") not to exceed, in the case of any Unrestricted Subsidiary, the amount of
Investments previously made by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in such
Unrestricted Subsidiary, which amount was included in the calculation of the amount
of Restricted Payments.

(b) The provisions of the foregoing paragraph (a) will not prohibit:

(1) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition for value of Capital Stock of the
Issuer made by exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, Capital
Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock and other than Capital Stock issued or sold to a
Subsidiary of the Issuer or an employee share ownership plan or other trust to the extent funded by the
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries); provided, however, that:

(A) such purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition for value will be
excluded in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments, and

(B) the Net Cash Proceeds from such sale applied in the manner set forth in this clause (1) will be
excluded from the calculation of amounts under clause (4)(C)(ii) of paragraph (a) above;

172


-----

(2) any prepayment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement, defeasance or other
acquisition for value of Subordinated Obligations of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary made by
exchange for, or out of the proceeds of the substantially concurrent sale of, Indebtedness of the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary that is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to paragraph (b) of the
covenant described under " —Limitation on Indebtedness;" provided, however, that such prepayment,
repayment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition for value will
be excluded from the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments;

(3) any prepayment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement, defeasance or other
acquisition for value of Subordinated Obligations from Net Available Cash to the extent permitted by
the covenant described under "—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock;" _provided,_
_however, that such prepayment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement, defeasance_
or other acquisition for value will be excluded from the calculation of the amount of Restricted
Payments;

(4) dividends paid within 60 days after the date of declaration thereof if at such date of declaration such
dividends would have complied with this covenant; _provided,_ _however, that such dividends will be_
included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments;

(5) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition for value of ordinary shares, or
options to purchase ordinary shares, of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries from employees, former
employees, directors or former directors of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (or permitted
transferees of such employees, former employees, directors or former directors), pursuant to the terms
of agreements (including employment agreements) or plans (or amendments thereto) approved by the
Board of Directors under which such individuals purchase or sell or are granted the option to purchase
or sell, shares of such ordinary shares; _provided,_ _however, that the aggregate amount of such_
purchases, repurchases, redemptions, retirements and other acquisitions for value will not exceed
€5 million in any calendar year; _provided_ _further,_ _however, that such purchase, repurchase,_
redemption, retirement or other acquisition for value will be included in the calculation of the amount of
Restricted Payments; or

(6) any payment of dividends, other distributions or other amounts by the Issuer for the purposes set forth
in clauses (A) through (E) below; _provided,_ _however, that such dividends, distributions or other_
payments set forth in clauses (A), (B) and (D) will be excluded from the calculation of the amount of
Restricted Payments and such dividends, distributions or other payments set forth in clauses (C) and
(E) will be included in the amount of Restricted Payments:

taxes to the extent attributable to the income of such Unrestricted Subsidiaries);

(C) to any Telenet Holding Company to be used solely to pay cash interest when due on Public
Debt issued by a Telenet Holding Company; _provided,_ _however, that at the time of such_

Public Equity Offering was of ordinary shares of the Issuer and such dividends, distributions or other
amounts are paid to holders of ordinary shares of the Issuer or (y) such Public Equity Offering was of
ordinary shares of a Telenet Holding Company and the dividends, distributions or other amounts are
used by such Telenet Holding Company to pay dividends, distributions or other amounts to holders of
ordinary shares of such Telenet Holding Company; _provided,_ _further, that such dividends,_
distributions or other amounts will be included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted Payments;

(10) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition for value of fractional shares of

the Closing Date;

(B) any encumbrance or restriction with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to an
agreement relating to any Indebtedness Incurred by such Restricted Subsidiary prior to the
date on which such Restricted Subsidiary was acquired by the Issuer (other than Indebtedness
Incurred as consideration for, in contemplation of, or to provide all or any portion of the funds

(i) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any
property or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract,

Restricted Subsidiary so long as such restriction relates solely to the property so
acquired (other than any encumbrance or restriction created as consideration for, in
contemplation of, in connection with or pursuant to the provision of, all or any portion
of the funds or credit support utilized to consummate the transaction or series of
related transactions pursuant to which such property was otherwise acquired by the
Issuer),

(iii) under agreements relating to Purchase Money Indebtedness Incurred that impose
customary restrictions on the property subject to such Purchase Money Indebtedness
or

(iv) relating to Indebtedness that is permitted to be Incurred and secured without also
securing the Notes or the applicable Subsidiary Guarantee pursuant to the covenants
described under "—Limitation on Indebtedness" and "—Limitation on Liens" that limit
the right of the debtor to dispose of the property securing such Indebtedness;

(E) any customary encumbrance or restriction imposed with respect to a Restricted Subsidiary
pursuant to an agreement entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the
Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary pending the closing of such sale or
disposition;

(G) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to an agreement governing any Bank Indebtedness of
a Restricted Subsidiary permitted to be Incurred subsequent to the Closing Date pursuant to
the covenant described under " —Limitation on Indebtedness" if the encumbrances and
restrictions contained in any such agreement, taken as a whole, are no less favorable to the
Holders than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the agreement governing the
Existing Credit Facility in effect on the Closing Date.

_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock. (a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any_
Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Disposition unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives consideration (including by way of relief from, or by
any other Person assuming sole responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise) at the time of
such Asset Disposition at least equal to the Fair Market Value of the shares and assets subject to such
Asset Disposition,

(2) at least 75% of the consideration thereof received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary is in the
form of cash or Temporary Cash Investments, and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the
Issuer (or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be)

(A) _first, to the extent the Issuer elects (or is required by the terms of any Indebtedness), to_
permanently prepay or repay, purchase, repurchase, redeem, retire, defease or otherwise
acquire for value Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer, Senior Indebtedness or Senior
Subordinated Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor or Indebtedness of a Subsidiary of the
Issuer that is not a Subsidiary Guarantor (in each case, other than Indebtedness owed to the
Issuer, a Subsidiary of the Issuer or a Person of which the Issuer is a Subsidiary and other
than obligations in respect of Disqualified Stock);

(B) _second, to the extent of the balance of Net Available Cash after application in accordance_
with clause (A), to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to reinvest in
Additional Assets (including by means of an Investment in Additional Assets by a Restricted
Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary);

(C) _third, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash not applied in accordance with_
clauses (A) and (B) within 360 days from the later of such Asset Disposition or the receipt of
such Net Available Cash (provided, however, that such 360-day period shall be extended by
up to 180 days to the extent a binding contractual commitment to reinvest in or purchase
Additional Assets shall have been entered into by such 360th day to the extent such
commitment remains in effect and the planned reinvestment or purchase has not been
abandoned or cancelled), to make an Excess Proceeds Offer (as defined in paragraph (b) of
this covenant below) to purchase Notes pursuant to and subject to the conditions set forth in
paragraph (b) of this covenant, subject to proration as described in paragraph (b) below; and

(D) _fourth, to the extent of the balance of such Net Available Cash after application in_
accordance with clauses (A), (B) and (C), for any general corporate purpose permitted by the
terms of the Indenture;

_provided,_ _however, that in connection with any permanent prepayment or repayment, purchase,_
repurchase, redemption, retirement, defeasance or other acquisition for value of Indebtedness pursuant
to clause (A), (C) or (D) above, the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness
and will cause the related loan commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal to
the principal amount so permanently prepaid or repaid, purchased, repurchased, redeemed, retired,
defeased or otherwise acquired for value. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant,
clause (2) of this paragraph (a) shall not apply to a Canal+ Content Disposition.

Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this covenant, the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries will not be
required to apply any Net Available Cash in accordance with this covenant except to the extent that the aggregate Net
Available Cash from all Asset Dispositions that is not applied in accordance with this covenant exceeds [€10] million.

For the purposes of clause (2) of paragraph (a) of this covenant, the following are deemed to be cash:

      - the assumption of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than Subordinated
Obligations) and the release of the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such

176


-----

Indebtedness in connection with such Asset Disposition,

      - securities received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary from the transferee that are promptly
converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash and

      - Additional Assets received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary.

(b) In the event of an Asset Disposition that requires the purchase of Notes pursuant to clause (a)(3)(C) of
this covenant, the Issuer will be required to purchase Notes tendered pursuant to an offer by the Issuer for the Notes
(an "Excess Proceeds Offer"), which Excess Proceeds Offer shall be in the amount of the Allocable Excess Proceeds,
on a pro rata basis according to principal amount, at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof,
plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the purchase date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the
relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date), in accordance with the procedures
(including prorating in the event of over-subscription) set forth in the Indenture. To the extent that any portion of the
amount of Net Available Cash remains after compliance with the preceding sentence, the Issuer will apply the
remaining Net Available Cash in accordance with clause (a)(3)(D) of this covenant. The Issuer will not be required to
make an Excess Proceeds Offer for Notes (and other Senior Indebtedness) pursuant to this covenant if the Net
Available Cash available therefor (after application of the proceeds as provided in clauses (a)(3)(A) and (a)(3)(B)) is
less than [€10 million for any particular Asset Disposition (which lesser amount will be carried forward for purposes of]
determining whether an Excess Proceeds Offer is required with respect to the Net Available Cash from any
subsequent Asset Disposition).

The term "Allocable Excess Proceeds" means the product of:

(x) the amount of Net Available Cash remaining after application in accordance with clauses (a)(3)(A)
and (a)(3)(B) above and

(y) a fraction,

(1) the numerator of which is the aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding on the date
of an Excess Proceeds Offer, plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to such date,
and

(2) the denominator of which is the sum of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
outstanding on the date of such Excess Proceeds Offer, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, if any, to such date, and the aggregate principal amount (or accreted value in the case
of Indebtedness with original issue discount) of other Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer
outstanding on the date of such Excess Proceeds Offer, plus accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, if any, to such date, that is pari passu in right of payment with the Notes and subject
to terms and conditions in respect of Asset Dispositions similar in all material respects to the
covenant described hereunder and requiring the Issuer to make an offer to purchase such
Senior Indebtedness at substantially the same time as such Excess Proceeds Offer.

(c) The Issuer will comply with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange Act and any applicable
securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this covenant. To the extent that
the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this covenant, the Issuer will comply with
the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under this
covenant by virtue thereof.

_Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates. (a) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted_
Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, enter into or conduct any transaction or series of related transactions (including the
purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (an
"Affiliate Transaction") unless such transaction is on terms:

(1) that are no less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those
that could be obtained at the time of such transaction in arm's-length dealings with a Person who is not
such an Affiliate,

177


-----

(2) that, in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate amount in excess of [€10] million,

(A) are set forth in writing, and

(B) have been approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors having no
personal stake in such Affiliate Transaction, and

(3) that, in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate amount in excess of [€25 million,]
have been determined by an Independent Financial Advisor to be fair, from a financial standpoint, to
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

(b) The provisions of the foregoing paragraph (a) will not prohibit:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be paid pursuant to the covenant described under "—Limitation
on Restricted Payments,"

(2) any issuance of securities, or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities (including stock
options and similar rights) or similar transfers to employees and directors of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries pursuant to, or for the purpose of funding, employment arrangements, stock options and
share ownership plans approved by the Board of Directors,

(3) any loans or advances, or Guarantees of third-party loans, to directors, officers and employees in the
ordinary course of business in accordance with past practices of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary,
as applicable, but in any event not to exceed [€10] million in the aggregate outstanding at any one time,

(4) the payment of reasonable fees and indemnities (including under customary insurance) to directors and
officers of the Issuer and any of its Subsidiaries,

(5) any transaction between the Issuer and a Restricted Subsidiary or between Restricted Subsidiaries or
with any joint venture or similar entity that would constitute an Affiliate Transaction solely because the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary owns an equity interest in or otherwise controls such joint venture or
similar entity,

(6) any Specified Affiliate Transaction, or any agreement (other than a Specified Affiliate Transaction) in
effect on the Closing Date or any amendment or other modification thereto (so long as such
amendment or other modification is not disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect) or any
transactions pursuant thereto,

(7) the issuance and sale of Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Issuer to (A) any Telenet
Holding Company or (B) any officer or director of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Telenet
Holding Company and

(8) maintenance in the ordinary course of business of the Issuer or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary of
customary employee benefit plans or arrangements, including vacation plans, health and life insurance
plans, deferred compensation plans, retirement and savings plans.

_Limitation on the Sale or Issuance of Capital Stock of Restricted Subsidiaries. The Issuer will not sell or_
otherwise dispose of any shares of Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, and will not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, to issue or sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of its Capital Stock except:

(1) to the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary,

(2) the issuance and sale to a director of such Restricted Subsidiary of shares of Capital Stock of such
Restricted Subsidiary as directors' qualifying shares, to the extent required by applicable law,

(3) the Incurrence of a Lien permitted under the covenant described under "—Limitation on Liens" (solely

178


-----

to the extent such Incurrence constitutes a disposition of the Capital Stock subject to such Lien under
applicable law),

(4) the issuance and sale to a citizen of a jurisdiction of shares of Capital Stock of such Restricted
Subsidiary, to the extent required by the applicable law of such jurisdiction,

(5) if, immediately after giving effect to such issuance, sale or other disposition, neither the Issuer nor any
of its Restricted Subsidiaries own any Capital Stock of such Restricted Subsidiary,

(6) if, immediately after giving effect to such issuance or sale, such Restricted Subsidiary would no longer
constitute a Restricted Subsidiary and any Investment in such Person remaining after giving effect
thereto would have been permitted to be made under the covenant described under " —Limitation on
Restricted Payments" if made on the date of such issuance, sale or other disposition (and such
Investment shall be deemed to be an Investment for the purposes of such covenant) (disregarding
clause (9) of the definition of "Permitted Investment") or

(7) in the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Issuer, the
issuance by such Restricted Subsidiary of Capital Stock to the holders of the Capital Stock of such
Restricted Subsidiary on a basis that is no more favorable to the shareholders of such Restricted
Subsidiary (other than the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries) than a pro rata basis.

_Limitation on Liens. The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,_
Incur or permit to exist any Lien of any nature whatsoever (any such Lien, an "Initial Lien") on any of its property or
assets (including Capital Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary), whether owned at the Closing Date or thereafter acquired,
other than Permitted Liens, without effectively providing that the Notes shall be secured equally and ratably with (or
prior to) the obligations so secured for so long as such obligations are so secured.

Any Lien created for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph may provide
by its terms that (a) such Lien will be automatically and unconditionally released and discharged (1) upon the full and
unconditional release and discharge of the Initial Lien or (2) with respect to any Subsidiary Guarantor the assets or the
Capital Stock of which are encumbered by such Lien, upon the release of the Subsidiary Guarantee of such Subsidiary
Guarantor in accordance with the provision described under "Subsidiary Guarantees" and (b) the Person in favor of
whom such Initial Lien was created may exclusively control the disposition of property subject to such Initial Lien.

_Ongoing Reporting. So long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee, without cost_
to the Trustee (who, at the Issuer's expense, will furnish by mail to the Holders):

(1) within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, annual reports of Parent containing substantially the
same information required to be contained in an Annual Report of Foreign Private Issuer on Form 20-F
under the Exchange Act, as in effect on the Closing Date, including (A) audited financial statements
prepared in accordance with GAAP, (B) a presentation of EBITDA of Parent derived from such
financial statements and (C) the information contained in Annex B of this offering memorandum
updated as of the end of such fiscal year; provided that such information need be provided only to the
extent that material changes to such information have occurred from the last set of such information
set forth in Annex B or provided for the preceding fiscal year, as the case may be;

(2) within 60 days after the end of each of the first three fiscal quarters of each fiscal year, reports of
Parent containing substantially the same information required to be contained in a Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act, as in effect on the Closing Date, including (A) unaudited financial
statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and (B) a presentation of EBITDA of Parent derived
from such financial statements; provided that solely with respect to the quarter ending December 31,
2003, the Issuer shall be required to provide such a report within 75 days after the end of such quarter;
_provided,_ _further, that, in any such report, quarterly financial and operating information for the_
quarters ended during the fiscal years ending December 31, 2002 and 2003, shall only be required to be
presented on a basis comparable to the quarterly financial and operating information set forth in this
offering memorandum; and

179


-----

(3) promptly from time to time after the occurrence of an event required to be therein reported, such other
reports containing substantially the same information required to be contained in a Current Report on
Form 8-K under the Exchange Act, as in effect on the Closing Date;

_provided, however, that such reports shall not be required to (a) contain any certifications required by the applicable_
form, (b) contain separate financial statements for Subsidiary Guarantors or Subsidiaries the shares of which are
pledged to secure the Notes or any Subsidiary Guarantee that would be required under Item 3-10 or Item 3-16 of
Regulation S-X, respectively, promulgated by the SEC to the extent that condensed consolidating footnote disclosure
containing at least the types of information included in this offering memorandum is included therein, (c) comply with
Regulation G under the Exchange Act or Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC with respect to any
non-GAAP financial measures contained therein or (d) contain any financial statements of acquired companies or
related pro forma information that would otherwise be required, except to the extent such financial statements and
information is available without unreasonable expense; _provided further, however, such reports shall contain an_
explanation and quantification of any material differences between Parent's financial condition and results of operation,
together with information of the type presented under "Capitalization" in this offering memorandum with respect to the
Issuer and its subsidiaries.

At any time that any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries, then the quarterly and annual
financial information required by the preceding paragraph will include a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the
face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, and in "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations" or other comparable section, of the financial condition and results of operations of
the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

In addition, the Issuer will furnish to the holders of the Notes and to prospective investors, upon request of such
holders, any information required to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act so long as the
Notes are not freely tradable under the Securities Act.

The Issuer will also make available copies of all reports required by clauses (1) through (3) above (x) on the
Issuer's website, (y) to the newswire or other service of Bloomberg L.P. or, if Bloomberg L.P. does not then operate
any such service, any similar agency and (z) if and so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange
and the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require, at the specified office of the Luxembourg Transfer
Agent.

_Limitation on Activities. The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, engage in any_
business, other than a Permitted Business.

_Limitation on Sale/Leaseback Transactions. The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted_
Subsidiary to, enter into any Sale/Leaseback Transaction with respect to any property unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary would be entitled to:

(A) Incur Indebtedness in an amount equal to the Attributable Debt with respect to such
Sale/Leaseback Transaction pursuant to the covenant described under "—Limitation on
Indebtedness" and

(B) create a Lien on such property securing such Attributable Debt without equally and ratably
securing the Notes pursuant to the covenant described under "—Limitation on Liens,"

(2) the net proceeds received by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary in connection with such
Sale/Leaseback Transaction are at least equal to the Fair Market Value of such property and

(3) the transfer of such property is permitted by, and the Issuer applies the proceeds of such transaction in
compliance with, the covenant described under "—Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary
Stock."

_Impairment of Security Interest. The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or_

180


-----

omit to take any action that might have the result of materially impairing the security interest with respect to the
Collateral for the benefit of the Junior Security Agent as joint creditor together with the Holders, and the Issuer will not,
and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to any Person other than the Junior Security Agent as joint
creditor together with the holders of the Notes (but excluding any Additional Notes), any interest whatsoever in the
Collateral, except as a result of Permitted Collateral Liens; _provided,_ _however, that a Security Agreement or the_
Parent Intercompany Loan Pledge may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or otherwise
modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or replacement, the Issuer delivers to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance
substantially similar to the opinions delivered with respect to the Security Agreements on the Closing Date and subject
to such qualifications and reservations, including as to bankruptcy laws, customary at that time or otherwise in form and
substance determined by the Trustee to be satisfactory, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related
to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens
created under such Security Agreement or the Parent Intercompany Loan Pledge, as applicable, so amended,
extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid and perfected Liens not otherwise subject to
any limitation or imperfection, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not subject to when originally granted.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the foregoing shall not apply to a Share Pledge over (a) the shares of
MixtICS ceasing to be in effect solely as a result of a merger of MixtICS into Telenet Operaties or (b) the shares of
Telenet Operaties ceasing to be in effect solely as a result of a merger of Telenet Operaties into Telenet Bidco, in each
case, that complies with the requirements set forth below under "Merger and Consolidation."

The Indenture further provides that the Issuer will not, and the Issuer will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor
to, amend, extend, renew, restate, supplement or otherwise modify or replace, or enter into any consent or waiver
under, any Proceeds Loan Agreement, the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Agreement, the Junior
Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Intercreditor Agreement, any Security Agreement or the Parent
Intercompany Loan Pledge in a manner adverse to the interests of the Holders, subject, in the case of an amendment
to any Security Agreement or the Parent Intercompany Loan Pledge, to the immediately preceding paragraph and
except for amendments necessary to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency in any such agreement. To
the extent necessary to give effect to any Lien permitted to be Incurred as a Permitted Collateral Lien securing on a
first priority basis new Bank Indebtedness, the Trustee will be required by the terms of the Indenture to direct the
Junior Security Agent to, and the Junior Security Agent will be required to, release and re-take any security interest in
the Collateral; provided that the Issuer shall have provided the Trustee with an Officers' Certificate to the effect that
the Collateral will not be subject to any Lien to which it was not subject prior to such release and re-taking, except a
Permitted Collateral Lien.

**Merger and Consolidation**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all its
assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Company") will be a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of any country that is a Member State on the Closing Date, the
United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company
(if not the Issuer) will expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the
Trustee, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes and the Indenture;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an
obligation of the Successor Company or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as
having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, the Successor Company would be able to Incur an
additional [€1.00 of Indebtedness under paragraph] (a) of the covenant described under "Certain
Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness;"

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply

181


-----

with the Indenture; and

(5) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the Holders will
not recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal or U.K. income tax purposes or for income tax
purposes of the jurisdiction of organization of the Issuer or the Successor Company as a result of such
transaction and will be subject to U.S. Federal income tax in the U.S., and income tax in such other
jurisdictions, on the same amounts and at the same times as would be the case if such transaction had
not occurred and, as a result of such transaction, there will be no additional Belgian withholding taxes
and no withholding taxes of any other jurisdiction imposed on any payments made pursuant to the
Notes.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of,
the Issuer under the Indenture, but the predecessor Issuer in the case of a conveyance, transfer or lease of all or
substantially all its assets will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes.

In addition, the Issuer will not permit any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Restricted Subsidiary to consolidate
with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially all of its assets to any Person unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the "Successor Guarantor") will be a corporation
organized and existing under the laws of a country that is a Member State on the Closing Date, the
United States of America, any State thereof or the District of Columbia, and such Person (if not such
Subsidiary Guarantor) will expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to
the Trustee, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of such Subsidiary
Guarantor under its Subsidiary Guarantee;

(2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction (and treating any Indebtedness which becomes an
obligation of the Successor Guarantor or any Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction as
having been Incurred by the Successor Guarantor or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such
transaction), no Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

(3) the Issuer will have delivered to the Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each
stating that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if any) comply
with the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing:

(A) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate with, merge into or transfer all or part of its
properties and assets to the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor that is a Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided,_ _however, that no Restricted Subsidiary shall be permitted to consolidate with,_
merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any Subsidiary Guarantor if
following such consolidation, merger or transfer such Subsidiary Guarantor would be prohibited
by applicable law from continuing to provide a Subsidiary Guarantee or the amount of such
Subsidiary Guarantee would be required to be limited to a greater extent than immediately
prior to such consolidation, merger or transfer and

(B) the Issuer may merge with an Affiliate incorporated solely for the purpose of reincorporating
the Issuer in another jurisdiction to realize tax or other benefits.

**Defaults**

Each of the following is an Event of Default:

(1) a default in any payment of interest on any Note when due and payable continued for 30 days,

(2) a default in the payment of principal of any Note when due and payable at its Stated Maturity, upon
required redemption or repurchase, upon declaration or otherwise,

182


-----

(3) the failure to comply with obligations under the covenant described under "Merger and Consolidation"
above,

(4) the failure to comply for 30 days after notice with any obligations under the covenants described under
"Change of Control," "Payments of Additional Amounts" or "Certain Covenants" above (in each case,
other than a failure to purchase Notes),

(5) the failure to comply for 60 days after notice with any other agreement contained in the Notes or the
Indenture,

(6) the failure by the Issuer or any Subsidiary to pay any Indebtedness within any applicable grace period
after final maturity or the acceleration of any such Indebtedness by the holders thereof because of a
default if the total amount of such Indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds [€15 million or its]
equivalent in another currency (the "cross-acceleration provision"),

(7) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the Issuer, Telenet Bidco or a Significant
Subsidiary (the "bankruptcy provisions"),

(8) the rendering of any judgment or decree for the payment of money in excess of [€15] million or its
equivalent in another currency against the Issuer or a Subsidiary if:

(A) an enforcement proceeding thereon is commenced by any creditor or

(B) such judgment or decree remains outstanding for a period of 60 days following such judgment
and is not discharged, waived or stayed before the end of such period (the "judgment default
provision"),

(9) any Subsidiary Guarantee or the guarantee of the Operaties Proceeds Loan by MixtICS ceases to be
in full force and effect (except as contemplated by the terms thereof) or any Subsidiary Guarantor or
MixtICS or Person acting by or on behalf of such Subsidiary Guarantor or MixtICS denies or
disaffirms such Subsidiary Guarantor's or MixtICS's obligations under the Indenture, any Subsidiary
Guarantee or the guarantee of the Operaties Proceeds Loan, as applicable, and such Default continues
for 10 days after the notice specified in the Indenture or

(10) a security interest under any Security Agreement or the Parent Intercompany Loan Pledge shall, at
any time, cease to be in full force and effect for any reason other than the satisfaction in full of all
obligations under the Indenture or the release of such security interest in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture or any such Security Agreement or any security interest created thereunder shall be
declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer or any Subsidiary Guarantor shall assert that any such
security interest is invalid or unenforceable, and such Default continues for 10 days after the notice
specified in the Indenture.

The foregoing will constitute Events of Default whatever the reason for any such Event of Default and
whether it is voluntary or involuntary or is effected by operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of
any court or any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body.

However, a default under clause (4), (5), (9) or (10) will not constitute an Event of Default until the Trustee
notifies the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes notify the Issuer and the
Trustee of the default and the Issuer, the Subsidiary or the Subsidiary Guarantor, as applicable, does not cure such
default within the time specified in clause (4), (5), (9) or (10) hereof after receipt of such notice. Such notice must
specify the Default, demand that it be remedied and state that such notice is a notice of Default.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization of the Issuer or Telenet Bidco) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes by notice to the Issuer may declare the principal of and accrued but unpaid
interest on all the Notes to be due and payable. Upon such a declaration, such principal and interest will be due and
payable immediately. If an Event of Default relating to certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization of the

183


-----

Issuer or Telenet Bidco occurs, the unpaid principal of and interest on all the Notes will become immediately due and
payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders. Under certain circumstances,
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes may rescind any such acceleration with respect
to the Notes and its consequences.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, in case an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity
or security satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to enforce the right to receive
payment of principal, premium (if any) or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the
Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing,

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee in
writing to pursue the remedy,

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any
loss, liability or expense,

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the
offer of security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee a
direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes will be
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any
direction that the Trustee determines (after consultation with counsel) conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the
Trustee determines is unduly prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that may involve the Trustee in personal
liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in
its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

If a Default occurs and is continuing and is known to the Trustee, the Trustee must mail to each Holder notice
of the Default within the earlier of 90 days after it occurs or 30 days after it is known to a Trust Officer or written
notice of it is received by the Trustee. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, premium (if any)
or interest on any Note (including payments pursuant to the redemption provisions of such Note), the Trustee may
withhold notice if and so long as a committee of its Trust Officers in good faith determines that withholding notice is in
the interests of the Holders. In addition, the Issuer will be required to deliver to the Trustee, within 120 days after the
end of each fiscal year, a certificate indicating whether the signers thereof know of any Default that occurred during
the previous year. The Issuer will also be required to deliver to the Trustee, within 30 days after the occurrence
thereof, written notice of any event which would constitute certain Events of Default, their status and what action the
Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

**Amendments and Waivers**

Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture or the Notes may be amended with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding voting (either in person or by proxy) at a duly convened
meeting and any past default or compliance with certain provisions may be waived with the consent of the Holders of a
majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. However, with respect to the Notes, without the affirmative
vote at a duly convened meeting of each Holder of an outstanding Note affected, no amendment may, among other
things:

(1) reduce the amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment,

(2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest on any Note,

184


-----

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note,

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any Note
may be redeemed as described under "Optional Redemption" above,

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note,

(6) make any change to the subordination provisions of the Indenture that adversely affects the rights of
any Holder,

(7) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of, and interest on, such Holder's Notes
on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with
respect to such Holder's Notes,

(8) make any change in the amendment provisions which require each Holder's consent or in the waiver
provisions,

(9) modify the Subsidiary Guarantees in any manner adverse to the Holders or

(10)
(A) release the security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than
pursuant to the terms of the Security Agreements, the Parent Intercompany Loan Pledge, the
Intercreditor Agreement or the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Intercreditor
Agreement or as otherwise permitted by the Indenture, or

(B) release any other security interest that may have been granted in favor of the Holders of the
Notes other than pursuant to the terms of such security interest or as otherwise permitted by
the Indenture.

With respect to the Notes, without the consent of any Holder, Parent, the Issuer, the Subsidiary Guarantors,
the Trustee and the Junior Security Agent may amend the Indenture to:

      - cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency; provided that such amendment does not, in the
opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect,

      - provide for the assumption by a successor corporation of the obligations of the Issuer under the
Indenture,

      - provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided, _however,_
that the uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code,
or in a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code),

      - to make any change in the subordination provisions of the Indenture that would limit or terminate the
benefits available to any holder of Senior Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Subsidiary Guarantor (or any
Representative thereof) under such subordination provisions,

      - add additional Guarantees with respect to the Notes or to release Subsidiary Guarantors from
Subsidiary Guarantees as provided by the terms of the Indenture,

      - add to the covenants of the Issuer for the benefit of the Holders or to surrender any right or power
conferred upon the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries,

      - make any change that does not in the opinion of the Trustee adversely affect the rights of any Holder,
subject to the provisions of the Indenture,

      - provide for the issuance of Additional Notes,

185


-----

      - further secure the Notes or release all or any portion of the Collateral pursuant to the terms of the
Security Agreements,

      - mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest in any Collateral or other property for the
benefit of any Person; provided, however, that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited
by the Indenture and the covenants described under "Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security
Interest" and "—Limitation on Liens" are complied with or

      - the extent permitted by the covenant described under "Additional Intercreditor Agreements."

However, no amendment may be made to the subordination provisions of the Indenture that adversely affects
the rights of any holder of Senior Indebtedness of a Subsidiary Guarantor then outstanding unless the holders of such
Senior Indebtedness (or any group or Representative thereof authorized to give a consent) consent to such change.

The Indenture will contain provisions governing the conduct of meetings of Holders. Among other things, these
provisions will provide that (a) the Issuer or Holders of at least 20% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
outstanding will be permitted to call a meeting of Holders for the purpose of amendments to or modifications of the
terms of the Notes or the Indenture by publishing a notice in accordance with Belgian law (in addition to any notice
requirements imposed by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, for so long as the Notes are listed thereon), (b) the quorum
requirement for such meeting will be the presence (either in person or by proxy) of Holders of at least 50% in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes outstanding, (c) if a quorum is not present at upon the first convocation of a
meeting, a second meeting may be convened for the same purpose for which there is no quorum requirement and (d) in
the case of clause (b) or (c), the affirmative vote of Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes
outstanding or the vote of each Holder affected thereby, as applicable, would be required to approve a proposed
amendment or modification.

After an amendment becomes effective, the Issuer is required to mail to Holders a notice briefly describing
such amendment. However, the failure to give such notice to all Holders, or any defect therein, will not impair or affect
the validity of the amendment.

There is some uncertainty as to whether Belgian law may impose different requirements for amendments and
other modifications than those described above. See "Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Subsidiary Guarantees,
Pledges and Belgian Law—It is possible that a court may apply voting and meeting provisions of Belgian law which
are different than the requirements in the indenture which may prejudice your interests."

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer, any Subsidiary Guarantor or by any Person directly or
indirectly controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Issuer or any Subsidiary
Guarantor will be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding.

**Defeasance**

The Issuer may at any time terminate all its obligations under the Notes and the Indenture ("legal defeasance"),
except for certain obligations, including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or
exchange of the Notes, to replace mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and to maintain a registrar and paying
agent in respect of the Notes.

In addition, the Issuer may at any time terminate:

(1) its obligations under the covenants described under "Certain Covenants" and

(2) the operation of the cross-acceleration provision, the bankruptcy provisions with respect to Telenet
Bidco and Significant Subsidiaries and the judgment default provision described under "Defaults" above
and the limitation contained in clause (3) under the first paragraph of "Merger and Consolidation"

186


-----

above ("covenant defeasance").

In the event that the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option or its covenant defeasance option, each
Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from all of its obligations with respect to its Subsidiary Guarantee and the
Collateral (other than the Collateral deposited in the defeasance trust (as described below)) will be released.

The Issuer may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant
defeasance option. If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated
because of an Event of Default with respect thereto. If the Issuer exercises its covenant defeasance option, payment
of the Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default specified in clause (4), (6), (7) (with respect only
to Telenet Bidco and Significant Subsidiaries) or (8) under "Defaults" above or because of the failure of the Issuer to
comply with clause (3) under the first paragraph of "Merger and Consolidation" above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the "defeasance
trust") with the Trustee money in euros, in an amount sufficient or Government Obligations denominated in euros, the
principal of and interest on which will be sufficient, or a combination thereof sufficient, to pay the principal, premium (if
any) and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that Holders will not recognize
income, gain or loss for U.S. Federal, U.K. or Belgian income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance
and will be subject to U.S. Federal, U.K. and Belgian income tax on the same amounts and in the same manner and at
the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred (and, in the case of legal
defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or other change
in applicable U.S. Federal income tax law).

**Additional Intercreditor Agreements**

The Indenture will provide that, (a) at the request of the Issuer at the time of, or prior to, the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary Incurring or Guaranteeing any Bank Indebtedness permitted pursuant to paragraph (a) or
clause (1), (3) (to the extent relating to Bank Indebtedness under the Existing Credit Facility outstanding on the Closing
Date) or (12) (or, to the extent relating to any of the foregoing, clause (7)) of paragraph (b) of the covenant described
under "Certain Covenants—Limitation on Indebtedness" or securing such Indebtedness with any of the Collateral, the
Issuer, the relevant Restricted Subsidiaries, the Trustee and the Junior Security Agent shall enter into with the holders
of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized agents) an intercreditor agreement on substantially the same terms as
described above under "Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement," including containing
substantially the same terms with respect to the subordination and release of Guarantees and enforcement of security
interests (or terms more favorable to the Holders) or (b) at the time of, or prior to, the Issuer Incurring any Permitted
Shareholder Funding pursuant to clause (11) of paragraph (b) of the covenant described under "Certain Covenants—
Limitation on Indebtedness," the Issuer and the Junior Security Agent shall enter into with the holders of such
Permitted Shareholder Funding (or their duly authorized agents) an intercreditor agreement on substantially the same
terms as the Junior Subordinated Parent Intercompany Loan Intercreditor Agreement (or terms more favorable to the
Holders). Pursuant to any intercreditor agreement entered into pursuant to clause (a) of the preceding sentence, such
other Indebtedness may constitute Senior Indebtedness, Senior Subordinated Indebtedness that is _pari passu with the_
Subsidiary Guarantees or Subordinated Obligations and any Guarantee or security interest described in clause (a) of the
preceding sentence with respect to Indebtedness of the Issuer shall provide for its release and termination on
substantially the same terms (or terms more favorable to the Holders) as the Subsidiary Guarantees.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee (in accordance with the Indenture) will from time to time enter into, and direct the Junior Security Agent to
enter into, one or more amendments to any intercreditor agreement to (1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or
inconsistency in such intercreditor agreement, (2) increase the amount of Indebtedness of the types covered by such
intercreditor agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary that is subject to such
intercreditor agreement (including the addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of
payment to the Notes and Subsidiary Guarantees), (3) add guarantors to such intercreditor agreement, (4) further
secure the Notes, (5) secure other Indebtedness with the Collateral so long as the granting of such security interest,
and ranking of such security interest in relation to the priority of the security interest in the Collateral securing the
Notes and the Subsidiary Guarantees, is permitted under the Indenture, (6) permit payments to be made to the Issuer
that would not otherwise have been pursuant to the terms of such intercreditor agreement or (7) make any other such

187


-----

change to an intercreditor agreement that does not in the opinion of the Trustee adversely affect the Holders in any
material respect. The Issuer will not otherwise direct the Trustee to enter into, or to direct the Junior Security Agent to
enter into, any amendment to an intercreditor agreement without the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in the foregoing paragraphs shall
limit the application of the covenant described under "Certain Covenants—Impairment of Security Interests."

**Parent Guarantee**

Telenet Group Holding, as primary obligor and not merely as surety, will guarantee on a senior unsecured basis
the performance and full and punctual payment when due, whether at Stated Maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, of
all obligations of the Issuer under the Indenture (including obligations to the Trustee) and the Notes, whether for
payment of principal of or interest on or in respect of the Notes, expenses, indemnification or otherwise. This
Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the maximum amount that can be Guaranteed by Telenet Group
Holding without rendering such Guarantee voidable under applicable law relating to fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent
transfer or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. This Guarantee will rank _pari passu with the Senior_
Discount Notes.

**Prescription**

Claims against Telenet Group Holding, the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors for the payment of principal
on the Notes will be prescribed ten years after the applicable due date for the payment thereof. Claims against Telenet
Group Holding, the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors for the payment of interest or Additional Amounts, if any, on
the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Concerning the Trustee**

The Bank of New York is to be the Trustee under the Indenture and has been appointed by the Issuer as a
paying agent with regard to the Notes.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes will be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of
New York without giving effect to applicable principles of conflicts of law to the extent that the application of the law
of another jurisdiction would be required thereby.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of Telenet Group Holding, the Issuer or any
Subsidiary Guarantor, as such will have any liability for any obligations of Telenet Group Holding, the Issuer or any
Subsidiary Guarantor under the Notes, the Subsidiary Guarantees or the Indenture, or for any claim based on, in
respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases
such liability. The waiver and release are part of the consideration for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be
effective to waive liabilities under U.S. Federal securities laws.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since the Issuer and the Subsidiary Guarantors are incorporated in Belgium and all their operating assets and
the operating assets of their Subsidiaries are outside the United States, any judgment obtained in the United States
against the Issuer or the Subsidiary Guarantors, including judgments with respect to the payment of principal, premium,
interest, Additional Amounts and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not be collectable within the
United States. See "Service of Process and Enforcement of Liabilities."

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service of Process**

The Issuer will appoint CT Corporation System as its agent for service of process in any suit, action or
proceeding with respect to the Indenture or the Notes brought in any U.S. Federal or state court located in New York
City and each of the parties thereto will submit to the jurisdiction thereof.

**BOOK-ENTRY, FORM, CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT**

**Form of Notes**

The Notes will be represented by one or more global notes, in bearer form, which will represent the entire
principal amount of the Notes issued on the Closing Date. As discussed in more detail below, interests in the Notes will
be available to investors only in book-entry form (during the period in which Notes are represented by Global Notes, as
discussed in this section) or as Definitive Registered Notes (as defined below). Notes will not be issuable in definitive
bearer form under any circumstances. Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers in reliance on
Rule 144A under the Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note (the "Rule 144A Global Note"). Notes
sold outside the United States in reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by a
separate global note (the "Regulation S Global Note" and, together with the Rule 144A Global Note, the "Global
Notes").

Pursuant to an agreement between the Issuer and the National Bank of Belgium (the "NBB"), Global Notes
will be deposited on the Closing Date with the NBB as operator of a book-entry clearing system (the "X/N System").
Investors may hold interests in Notes directly in their securities accounts with the NBB or indirectly through an account
with one of the participants in the X/N System, which include Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and most credit
institutions and securities firms established in Belgium. In general, investors should be able to hold interests in Notes
through securities accounts in Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg in the same way as they would for any other
debt securities. Interests in Notes can be held and cleared in Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg in accordance
with their usual rules and operating procedures.

The person shown in the records of the NBB or the direct or indirect participants in the X/N System as the
holder of a particular nominal amount of Notes (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by the NBB,
or the relevant direct or indirect participants in the X/N System, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes save in
the event of manifest error) shall for all purposes be treated by the Issuer and any paying agent as the holder of such
nominal amount of Notes, other than with respect to the payment of principal, premium (if any), cash interest on such
Global Notes, the right to which will be vested, as against the Issuer and the Trustee, solely in the person shown in the
records of NBB as the holder of such principal amount at maturity of Global Notes.

**Original Issue**

On or before the date of completion of the offering of the Notes, ING Belgium SA/NV, the Principal Paying
Agent, on behalf of the Issuer, will deliver duly executed and authenticated Global Notes in bearer form to the NBB,
where they will be immobilized. Upon receipt of the Global Notes, the NBB will credit the Principal Paying Agent's
exempt securities account in the X/N System with an amount equivalent to the principal amount of the Global Notes.
On the date of completion of the offering of the Notes, the Principal Paying Agent will credit Euroclear's and/or
Clearstream, Luxembourg's exempt securities account in the X/N System with an amount equivalent to their respective
portion of the principal amount of the Global Notes. Following payment to the Issuer of the net proceeds for the issue
of the Notes, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg will credit the holders of book-entry interests in the Notes by
crediting their securities accounts as participants of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, in accordance with the
principal amount of Notes purchased by each of them.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes will be made by us to the Principal Paying
Agent. The Principal Paying Agent will make payments to the NBB, which will in turn make payments to Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Book-entry interests in the Global Notes will be exchangeable in whole but not in part for individual definitive
registered notes ("Definitive Registered Notes") only if (A) (i) the NBB ceases to operate the X/N System and (ii) a
successor operator is not appointed within 120 days of notice of such event, (B) both Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg notify the Issuer that they are unwilling or unable to continue to act as depository and a successor
depository is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days of notice of such event or (C) if, as a result of any

210


-----

amendment to, or change in, the laws or regulations of Belgium, another Member State or the United States (or any
political sub-division of any of the foregoing) or of any authority therein or thereof having power to tax or in the
interpretation, by a revenue authority or a court, or administration of such laws or regulations which become effective
after the Closing Date, the Issuer reasonably concludes that continuing to settle the Notes through the X/N System
would require it to make a deduction or withholding from any payment in respect of the Notes which would not then be
required in respect of Definitive Registered Notes.

In the event that Definitive Registered Notes become issuable pursuant to clause (A) above:

(i) the NBB shall deliver to the Principal Paying Agent a request for the issue of Definitive Registered
Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Notes; and

(ii) the Principal Paying Agent shall: (A) arrange for Definitive Registered Notes to be issued in the
amount of and in the name of the holders of book-entry interests in the Global Notes based on
instructions received by it from the NBB, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as applicable;
(B) request the NBB to deliver the Global Notes to the Principal Paying Agent within five business

(D) arrange for the entry of the Definitive Registered Notes in the register kept by the Issuer or an
agent appointed by the Issuer and the delivery of certificates evidencing the entry of the Definitive
Registered Notes in such register in the name of the relevant holders.

In the event that Definitive Registered Notes become issuable pursuant to clause (B) or (C) above:

(i) the Issuer shall deliver to the Principal Paying Agent a request for the issue of Definitive Registered
Notes in an aggregate principal amount equal to the principal of the Global Notes; and

(ii) the Principal Paying Agent shall: (A) arrange for Definitive Registered Notes to be issued in the

(D) arrange for the entry of the Definitive Registered Notes in the register kept by the Issuer or an
agent appointed by the Issuer and delivery of certificates evidencing the entry of the Definitive

So long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, in the event that Definitive Registered
Notes are issued, a notice will be published in Luxembourg in a daily leading newspaper with general circulation in
Luxembourg (expected to be the Luxemburger Wort).

In addition, book-entry interests in the Global Notes will be exchangeable in whole or in part for Definitive
Registered Notes at the request of any holder of such book-entry interests within 60 days following notice given by the
Issuer or the Trustee of an Event of Default described in clauses (1), (2), (6), (7) or (8) under "Description of the
Notes—Defaults," with respect to the Notes. Any such request must include the principal amount of the Definitive
Registered Notes to be issued at the request of such holder, together with such holder's name and account number in
the X/N System, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as applicable.

In the event that the Principal Paying Agent receives a request to issue Definitive Registered Notes in
accordance with the preceding paragraph, the Principal Paying Agent shall: (A) notify the NBB of such holder's
request; (B) deliver to the NBB a "schedule of amendment of the principal" to be annexed, according to the provisions
of the clearing agreement among the Issuer, the Principal Paying Agent and the NBB (the "Clearing Agreement"), to
the relevant Global Note reflecting the remaining principal amount of such Global Note (after giving effect to the
issuance of the Definitive Registered Notes pursuant to the sentence); and (C) notify the registrar thereof of the
amount of and the name in which such Definitive Registered Notes are to be issued, based on the details provided in
such holder's request, in order that the registrar (i) enter the Definitive Registered Notes in the register and (ii) cause
the delivery of certificates evidencing the entry of the Definitive Registered Notes in such register in the name of such
holder.

Definitive Registered Notes will not be eligible for settlement through the X/N System. All Definitive
Registered Notes will be subject to the relevant restrictive legends referred to in "Transfer Restrictions" unless that
legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable laws.

**Transfer of Notes**

The Global Notes may be transferred only in accordance with the Indenture, the Clearing Agreement and
subject to the restrictions on transfer and certification described in "Transfer Restrictions." Holders may exchange or
transfer their Notes upon notification and certification given to the Principal Paying Agent (attention: Financial Markets
Support Fixed Income), at fax number +32-2-557-1972 or at its address as set forth under "Description of the Notes."
The Global Notes will bear a legend as described under "Transfer Restrictions." The Clearing Agreement provides that
the Global Notes will represent the entries in the securities accounts at the X/N System and constitute a unique deposit
governed by the principle of fungibility.

Book-entry interests in the 144A Global Note ("restricted book-entry interests") may be transferred to a person
who takes delivery in the form of book-entry interests in the Regulation S Global Note ("unrestricted book-entry
interests") only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the
effect that the transfer is made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act and in accordance with any
applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, any sale or transfer of interests to U.S. persons
will not be permitted unless the resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A.

Unrestricted book-entry interests may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the form of restricted
book-entry interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that the transfer is being made to a person who the transferor reasonably believes is a
"qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A
or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions described under "Transfer Restrictions," and in accordance
with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other jurisdiction.

Any book-entry interest in one of the Global Notes that is transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of a book-entry interest in the other Global Note will, upon transfer, cease to be a book-entry interest in the first
Global Note and become a book-entry interest in the other Global Note, and accordingly, will thereafter be subject to all
transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to book-entry interests in that other Global Note for as long
as that person retains the book-entry interests.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred only in accordance with the Indenture, subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification described in "Transfer Restrictions," and in accordance with the following
procedure:

Holders of the Definitive Registered Notes will be recorded in the register kept by the Issuer, or an agent
appointed by the Issuer. Title to the Definitive Registered Notes will pass upon the registration of transfer in the
register. The Issuer, its paying agents and the Trustee may (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable laws) deem
and treat the registered Holder of any Definitive Registered Note as the absolute owner for all purposes (whether or
not the Note shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing on such Definitive Registered
Note or any notice of previous loss or theft of such Definitive Registered Note or of any trust or interest therein).
Transfer of the Definitive Registered Notes will only be registered upon the surrender of the Definitive Registered
Notes being transferred at the specified office of the Issuer or a paying agent. The Issuer, the Trustee and each paying
agent may require appropriate endorsement or transfer documents and the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax, assessment or other governmental charge payable in connection with certain transfers or exchanges.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be required to register the transfer of any of the Definitive
Registered Notes selected for redemption or due to be redeemed:

(1) for a period of 5 days before the date fixed for redemption; or

(2) for a period of 5 days before an Interest Payment Date.

**_Secondary Market Trading_**

Secondary market sales of book-entry interests in the Notes held through Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg or purchases of book-entry interests in the Notes through Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg will be
conducted in accordance with the normal rules and operating procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
and will be settled using the normal procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds.

**The Clearing Systems**

**_NBB_**

The NBB is the central bank of Belgium. The NBB operates the X/N System for, among other securities,
corporate debt securities which may be traded on a fungible basis. In order for the Notes to be traded on a fungible
basis, the initial purchasers have, and each purchaser of Notes will agree and will be deemed to have, agreed to the
application of the fungibility system as provided for in Royal Decree No. 62 of November 10, 1967 on the promotion of
the circulation of securities, as amended. The X/N System is accessible to investors and financial intermediaries
through its participants. The participants include most Belgian banks, some Luxembourg banks, Belgian investment
firms, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. For a description of the tax implications of the clearing of the Notes
through the X/N System and a description of the Eligible Investors qualified to hold the Notes, see "Certain Income Tax
Considerations—Belgian Tax Considerations—Belgian Withholding Tax."

**_Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg_**

Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg each hold securities for participating organizations and facilitate the
clearance and settlement of securities transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry
changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg provide to their respective
participants, among other things, services for safekeeping, administration, clearance and settlement of internationally
traded securities and securities lending and borrowing. Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg participants are
financial institutions throughout the world, including underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust
companies, clearing corporations and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg is also available to others, such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies which clear through or
maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg participant, either directly or indirectly.

Distributions of principal, interest and other payments with respect to book-entry interests in the Notes held
through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg will be credited, to the extent received by the Principal Paying
Agent, to the cash accounts of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg participants in accordance with the relevant
system's rules and procedures.

Non-participants of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg may hold and transfer book-entry interests in the
Notes through accounts with a direct participant of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg or any other securities
intermediary that holds a book-entry interest in the Notes through one or more securities intermediaries standing
between such other securities intermediary and Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg.

Euroclear has advised us as follows:

Under Belgian law, investors that are credited with securities on the records of Euroclear have a co-ownership
right in the fungible pool of interests in securities on deposit with Euroclear in an amount equal to the amount of
interests in securities credited to their accounts. In the event of the insolvency of Euroclear, Euroclear participants
would have a right under Belgian law to the return of the amount and type of interests in securities credited to their
accounts with Euroclear. If Euroclear does not have a sufficient amount of interests in securities on deposit of a
particular type to cover the claims of all participants credited with such interests in securities on Euroclear's records, all
participants having an amount of interests in securities of such type credited to their accounts with Euroclear would
have the right under Belgian law to the return of their pro rata share of the amount of interests in securities actually on
deposit.

Under Belgian law, Euroclear is required to pass on the benefits of ownership in any interest in securities on

213


-----

deposit with it (such as interest and principal payments, voting rights and other entitlements) to each person credited
with interests in securities on its records.

Clearstream, Luxembourg has advised us as follows:

Clearstream, Luxembourg is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a bank and is subject to regulation
by the Luxembourg Commission for the Supervision of the Financial Sector (Commission de Surveillance de Secteur
_Financier)._

Clearstream, Luxembourg holds securities for its customers and facilitates the clearance and settlement of
securities transactions among them through electronic book-entry transfers between their accounts, thereby eliminating
the need for physical movement of securities.

Clearstream, Luxembourg provides other services to its customers, including safekeeping, administration,
clearance and settlement of internationally traded securities and securities lending and borrowing.

Clearstream, Luxembourg interfaces with domestic securities markets in over 30 countries through established
depositary and custodial relationships.

Clearstream, Luxembourg's customers are worldwide financial institutions, including underwriters, securities
brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and clearing corporations. Clearstream, Luxembourg's U.S. customers are
limited to securities brokers and dealers and banks.

Indirect access to Clearstream, Luxembourg is also available to other institutions such as banks, brokers,
dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream, Luxembourg
customer.

Clearstream, Luxembourg has established an electronic link with Euroclear to facilitate settlement of trades
between Clearstream, Luxembourg and Euroclear.

**General**

Although the foregoing sets out the procedures of the X/N System, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg in
order to facilitate the original issue and subsequent transfers of interests in the Notes among participants of the X/N
System, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg, none of the NBB, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is under
any obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be discontinued at any
time.

None of the Issuer, the guarantors of the Notes nor any of their respective agents will have responsibility for
the performance of the NBB, Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg or their respective participants of their respective
obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations, including, without limitation, rules and procedures
relating to book-entry interests.

The information in this section concerning the NBB, Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg and their
respective book-entry systems has been obtained from sources that we believe to be reliable, but we take no
responsibility for the accuracy thereof.

**CERTAIN INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

**Belgian Tax Considerations**

The following is a summary of the principal Belgian tax consequences for investors of receiving interest in
respect of, and disposing of, Notes and is of a general nature based on the Issuer's understanding of current law and
practice. Except as otherwise indicated, this summary only addresses the position of investors who do not have any
connection with Belgium other than the holding of Notes. Investors should consult their professional advisers on the
possible tax consequences of subscribing for, purchasing, holding or selling Notes under the laws of their countries of
citizenship, residence, ordinary residence or domicile.

The present section does not address the tax situation of natural persons residing in Belgium.

**_Belgian Withholding Tax_**

_Notes in Book-Entry Form_

The interest component of payments on Notes is, as a rule, subject to Belgian withholding tax at the rate of
15%, subject to such relief as may be available under applicable domestic or tax treaty provisions.

All payments of interest by or on behalf of the Issuer shall be made without deduction of withholding tax for
Notes held in book-entry form by eligible investors (the "Eligible Investors") in an exempt securities account (an "XAccount") with the X/N System or with a participant or sub-participant in such system (a "Participant").

Eligible Investors are those persons referred to in Article 4 of the Royal Decree of May 26, 1994, including,
_inter alia:_

1° Belgian resident companies subject to corporate income tax within the meaning of Article 2, §2, 2° of
the Income Tax Code 1992 ("ITC 1992");

2° without prejudice to Article 262, 1° and 5° of ITC 1992, Belgian insurance or pension undertakings
within the meaning of Article 2, §3 of the Law of July 9, 1975 on supervision of insurance companies
(other than those referred in points 1° and 3° of said Article);

3° State-linked social security organizations and institutions assimilated therewith within the meaning of
Article 105, 2° of the Royal Decree of August 27, 1993 implementing ITC 1992;

4° non-residents of Belgium within the meaning of Article 105, 5° of said Royal Decree of August 27,
1993;

5° mutual funds within the meaning of Article 115 of said Royal Decree of August 27, 1993;

6° companies, entities or partnerships within the meaning of Article 227, 2° of ITC 1992 which are
subject to non-resident income tax in Belgium in accordance with Article 233 of ITC 1992 and whose
Notes are held as part of a taxable business activity in Belgium;

7° the Belgian State, with respect to its investments exempted from withholding tax in accordance with
Article 265 of ITC 1992;

8° mutual funds organized under foreign law which are structured as an undivided estate managed by a
management company on behalf of certificateholders, provided that their certificates are no publicly
offered or otherwise marketed in Belgium; and

9° Belgian resident companies not referred to in point 1 above whose sole or principal activity consists in
granting credits or loans.

Eligible Investors do not include natural persons residing in Belgium or not-for-profit organizations (other than

215


-----

those referred to in points 2 and 3 above). Participants to the X/N System must keep the Notes they hold for nonEligible Investors in a non-exempt securities account (an "N-Account"). All payments of interest on such Notes will be
made subject to deduction of withholding tax at the rate of 15%. In addition, the transfer of Notes by holders of an
N-Account is subject to withholding tax at the rate of 15% on the _pro rata interest accrued since the last preceding_
interest payment date.

Upon opening an X-Account with the X/N System or with a Participant, an Eligible Investor is required to
certify its eligible status on a standard form approved by the Minister of Finance. There are no ongoing certification
requirements for Eligible Investors, but direct Participants are required to annually report to the X/N System as to the
eligible status of each holder for whom they hold Notes in an X-Account.

In addition, an X-Account may be opened with a Participant by an intermediary (an "Intermediary") in respect
of Notes that such Intermediary holds for the account of its clients (the "Beneficial Owners"), provided that each
Beneficial Owner is an Eligible Investor. In such a case, the Intermediary is required to certify on a standard form
approved by the Minister of Finance that (i) it is an Eligible Investor, and (ii) the Beneficial Owners holding their Notes
through it are also Eligible Investors. A Beneficial Owner is also required to certify its eligible status on a standard
form approved by the Minister of Finance and to be delivered to the Intermediary.

However, none of these certification or reporting requirements apply in respect of Notes held in Euroclear or
Clearstream, Luxembourg in their capacity as Participants to the X/N System, provided that Euroclear or Clearstream,
Luxembourg must be able to identify each holder for whom they hold notes in an Exempt Account.

In accordance with rules and procedures of the X/N System, a Noteholder who is withdrawing Notes from an
X-Account may, following payment of interest accrued on such Notes from the last preceding interest payment date,
be entitled to claim an indemnity from the Belgian tax authorities of an amount equal to the withholding tax, if any,
applied on interest payable on the Notes for the period running from the last preceding interest payment date through
the date of withdrawal of the Notes from the X/N System.

_Definitive Registered Notes_

Definitive Registered Notes will not be eligible for clearing and settlement through the X/N System. Payments
of interest on Definitive Registered Notes will in principle be subject to Belgian withholding tax at the rate of 15%,
subject to such relief as may be available under domestic or tax treaty provisions.

Payments of interest by or on behalf of the Issuer will be made without deduction of withholding tax in respect
of Definitive Registered Notes held by non-residents of Belgium or certain Belgian financial institutions (and
assimilated entities) or certain state-linked social security organizations (and institutions assimilated therewith), subject
to the following requirements:

1° interest payments on Definitive Registered Notes are exempt from Belgian interest withholding tax if
made to non-residents of Belgium, provided that such a non-resident investor certifies on each interest
payment date in a form delivered to the Issuer that (i) it was the legal owner, or held the usufructus of
the Definitive Registered Notes during the entire interest period to which the interest payment relates,
(ii) it is a non-resident for Belgian income tax purposes, (iii) Definitive Registered Notes are not held
as part of a taxable business activity in Belgium, and (iv) the Definitive Registered Notes have been
registered with the Issuer in the name of such non-resident investor during the entire interest period to
which the interest payment relates;

2° interest payments on Definitive Registered Notes are exempt from Belgian interest withholding tax if
made to Belgian financial institutions or assimilated entities within the meaning of article 105, 1° of the
Royal Decree of August 27, 1993 implementing ITC 1992, provided that such a financial institution or
assimilated entity certifies on each interest payment date in a form delivered to the Issuer that (i) it
was the legal owner, or held the _usufructus of the Definitive Registered Notes during the entire_
interest period to which the interest payment relates, and (ii) the Definitive Registered Notes have
been registered with the Issuer in the name of such investor during the entire interest period to which
the interest payment relates; and

216


-----

3° interest payments on Definitive Registered Notes are exempt from Belgian interest withholding tax if
made to state-linked social security organizations and institutions assimilated therewith within the
meaning of Article 105, 2° of the Royal Decree of August 27, 1993 implementing ITC1992, provided
that such an organization or institution certifies on each interest payment date in a form delivered to the
Issuer that (i) it was the legal owner, or held the usufructus of the Definitive Registered Notes during
the entire interest period to which the interest payment relates, and (ii) the Definitive Registered Notes
have been registered with the Issuer in the name of such investor during the entire interest period to
which the interest payment relates.

_Guarantee Payments_

A Belgian resident Guarantor making payments under its Guarantee to non-residents of Belgium should be able
to make such payment without withholding for or on account of Belgian tax, although this is not free of uncertainty
given the limited availability of guidelines from the Belgian tax authorities or case law in this regard.

**_EU Savings Directive_**

On June 3, 2003, the EU Council adopted a directive regarding the taxation of savings income. Under this
directive, each Member State other than Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg will be required to provide the tax
authorities of each other Member State with details of payments of interest or other similar income paid by a person
within its jurisdiction to individuals resident in such other Member State. Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg will be
required to impose a withholding tax on such income. The withholding tax rate would initially be 15%, increasing to
20% after 2006 and 35% after 2009. These measures are scheduled to be applied by Member States from January 1,
2005, provided that Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino and relevant dependent or associated
territories of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands adopt similar measures from the same date. If and when (i) the
European Union enters into exchange of information agreements with Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Andorra
and San Marino and (ii) the Council of the European Union confirms that the United States is sufficiently committed to
exchange of information pursuant to bilateral agreements, Austria, Belgium and Luxembourg would, as of the end of
the first fiscal year following such agreements, cease to apply the withholding tax and would instead comply with the
automatic exchange of information rules applicable to the other Member States. Noteholders should consult their own
tax advisers regarding the implications of the directive in their particular circumstances.

**_Capital Gains_**

Capital gains realized with respect to the Notes are subject to Belgian tax only if the Notes are held as part of
a taxable business activity in Belgium.

For natural persons residing in Belgium and for Belgian legal entities subject to the Belgian income tax on legal
entities (impôt des personnes morales/rechtspersonenbelasting), the _pro rata_ interest included in a capital gain on
the Notes is taxable as interest at a rate of 15%.

**_Transfer Taxes_**

A stamp tax may be levied at the rate of 0.07% on the sale and on the purchase of Notes in Belgium, and at
the rate of 0.14% on the issuance of Notes to investors in Belgium, provided in each case that such transaction are
carried out through intermediation of a professional intermediary in Belgium. Such tax will, however, be limited to a
maximum amount of [€250 per taxable transaction. Moreover, an exemption from this tax is available under]
Article 126/1, 2° of the Code on Taxes assimilated with Stamp Tax as regards parties to securities trades who are
intermediaries within the meaning of Article 2 of the Law of April 6, 1995 on secondary markets and the status and
supervision of investment firms, intermediaries and investment advisers, acting for their own account, insurance
undertakings within the meaning of Article 2, §1 of the Law of July 9, 1975 on supervision of insurance companies,
pension funds within the meaning of Article 2, §3, 6° of the Law of July 9, 1975 on supervision of insurance companies,
pension funds within the meaning of Article 2, §3, 6° of the Law of July 9, 1975 on supervision of insurance companies
and of the Royal Decree of May 15, 1985 on the activities of private pension institutions, collective investment
schemes, or non-residents.

A stamp tax may also be levied at the rate of 0.2% on the physical delivery of definitive Notes issued in bearer

217


-----

form following their subscription or in connection with their purchase through intermediation of a professional
intermediary in Belgium. The Belgian Government has announced its intention to increase this tax to 0.6% for
deliveries as of January 1, 2004. An exemption from this tax is available under Article 159 of the Code on Taxes
assimilated with Stamp Tax as regards parties to securities trades who are intermediaries within the meaning of
Article 2, §1 of said Law of April 6, 1995. This tax does not apply to the issue, or subsequent trading, of Notes in bookentry form and to Definitive Registered Notes.

**U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations**

The following discussion summarizes the material U.S. federal income tax consequences for a U.S. holder of
purchasing, owning, and disposing of the Notes. You will be a U.S. holder if you are a citizen or resident of the United
States, a U.S. domestic corporation, or otherwise subject to U.S. federal income tax on a net income basis in respect of
income from the Notes. This summary deals only with U.S. holders that purchase Notes at their issue price as part of
the initial distribution and that hold Notes as capital assets. It does not address considerations that may be relevant to
you if you are an investor that is subject to special tax rules, such as a bank, thrift, real estate investment trust,
regulated investment company, insurance company, dealer in securities or currencies, trader in securities or
commodities that elects mark-to-market treatment, person that holds Notes as a hedge against currency risk or as a
position in a "straddle" or conversion transaction, tax-exempt organization, or person whose "functional currency" is not
the U.S. dollar.

The U.S. federal tax treatment of a partner in a partnership generally will depend on the status of the partner
and the activities of the partnership. A partner of a partnership holding the Notes should consult its tax advisors.

This summary is based on laws, regulations, rulings, and decisions in effect as of the date hereof, all of which
may change. Any change could apply retroactively and could affect the continued validity of this summary. You should
consult your own tax advisers about the tax consequences of purchasing, owning, and disposing of Notes, including the
relevance to your particular situation of the considerations discussed below, as well as the relevance to your particular
situation of state, local, foreign or other tax laws.

**_Interest on the Notes_**

Payments or accruals of interest on the Notes will be taxable to you as ordinary interest income from foreign
sources at the time that you receive or accrue such amounts (in accordance with your regular method of tax
accounting).

If you use the cash method of tax accounting, the amount of interest income you will realize will be the U.S.
dollar value of the payment in euro, calculated based on the exchange rate in effect on the date you receive the
payment, regardless of whether you convert the payment into U.S. dollars.

If you are an accrual-basis U.S. holder, the amount of interest income you will realize will be based on the
average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, with respect to an interest accrual period that
spans two taxable years, during the partial period within the taxable year). Alternatively, as an accrual-basis U.S.
holder, you may elect to translate all interest income on the Notes at the spot rate on the last day of the accrual period
(or the last day of the taxable year, in the case of an accrual period that spans more than one taxable year) or on the
date that you receive the interest payment if that date is within five business days of the end of the accrual period (or
taxable year). If you make this election, you must apply it consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and you
cannot change the election without the consent of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). If you use the accrual
method of accounting for tax purposes, you will recognize foreign currency gain or loss on the receipt of an interest
payment in euro if the exchange rate in effect on the date the payment is received differs from the rate applicable to a
previous accrual of that interest income. This foreign currency gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss,
but generally will not be treated as an adjustment to interest income received on the Notes in euro.

With certain exceptions, interest payments on a Note will be treated as "passive" income or, in the case of
certain U.S. holders, "financial services" income for purposes of computing the U.S. holder's foreign tax credit
allowable under U.S. federal income tax law. The rules relating to foreign tax credits and the timing thereof are
complex and U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit and the
application of foreign tax credit limitations to their particular situation.

218


-----

**_Purchase, Sale and Retirement of the Notes_**

Initially, your tax basis in a Note generally will equal the U.S. dollar value of the purchase price for the Note in
euro, calculated at the exchange rate in effect on the date of purchase. If you sell or exchange a Note, or if a Note that
you hold is retired, you generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount you realize on
the transaction (less any accrued interest, which will be subject to tax in the manner described above under "—Interest
on the Notes") and your tax basis in the Note. If you sell a Note for euro, or receive euro on the retirement of a Note,
the amount you will realize for U.S. tax purposes generally will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro that you receive,
calculated at the exchange rate in effect on the date the Note is sold or retired.

Except as discussed below with respect to foreign currency gain or loss, any gain or loss that you recognize on
the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note generally will be capital gain or loss, and will be long-term capital gain or
loss if you have held the Note for more than one year on the date of disposition. Net long-term capital gain recognized
by an individual U.S. holder generally will be subject to taxation at a reduced rate. The ability of U.S. holders to offset
capital losses against ordinary income is limited.

Despite the foregoing, gain or loss that you recognize on the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note generally
will be treated as ordinary income or loss to the extent that the gain or loss is attributable to changes in exchange rates
during the period in which you held the Note. This foreign currency gain or loss will not be treated as an adjustment to
interest income that you receive on the Note.

**_U.S. Information Reporting and Backup Withholding Rules_**

Payments in respect of the Notes that are made within the United States or through certain U.S.-related
financial intermediaries are subject to information reporting and may be subject to backup withholding unless you (i) are
a corporation or other exempt recipient or (ii) provide a taxpayer identification number and certify that no loss of
exemption from backup withholding has occurred. Holders that are not U.S. persons generally are not subject to
information reporting or backup withholding; however, such holders may be required to provide a certification to
establish their non-U.S. status in connection with payments received within the United States or from certain
U.S.-related payors.

Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Amounts withheld as backup withholding may be credited against a
holder's U.S. federal income tax liability. A holder may obtain a refund of any excess amounts withheld under the
backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for a refund with the IRS and furnishing any required
information in a timely manner.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions in the purchase agreement among the Issuer, Telenet Group Holding, the
Subsidiary Guarantors and the initial purchasers dated December 17, 2003, the Issuer has agreed to sell to the initial
purchasers, and the initial purchasers have agreed to purchase from the Issuer, the entire principal amount of the
Notes.

The obligations of the initial purchasers under the purchase agreement, including their agreement to purchase
Notes from the Issuer, are several and not joint. The purchase agreement provides that the initial purchasers will
purchase all the Notes if any of them are purchased.

The initial purchasers initially propose to offer the Notes for resale at the issue price that appears on the cover
of this offering memorandum. After the initial offering, the initial purchasers may change the offering price and any

In the purchase agreement, each initial purchaser has also agreed that:

The Notes are a new issue of securities, and there is currently no established trading market for the Notes. In
addition, the Notes are subject to certain restrictions on resale and transfer as described under "Transfer Restrictions."
We do not intend to apply for the Notes to be listed on any securities exchange other than the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange or to arrange for the Notes to be quoted on any quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that
they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so. The initial purchasers may discontinue
any market making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that a liquid
trading market will develop for the Notes, that you will be able to sell your Notes at a particular time or that the prices
that you receive when you sell will be favorable.

You should be aware that the laws and practices of certain countries require investors to pay stamp taxes and
other charges in connection with purchases of securities.

In connection with the offering of the Notes, J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. may engage in overallotment,
stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions. Overallotment involves sales in excess of the offering size,
which creates a short position for the initial purchasers. Stabilizing transactions involve bids to purchase the Notes in
the open market for the purpose of pegging, fixing or maintaining the price of the Notes. Syndicate covering
transactions involve purchases of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to
cover short positions. Stabilizing transactions and syndicate covering transactions may cause the price of the Notes to
be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of those transactions. If J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. engages in
stabilizing or syndicate covering transactions, it may discontinue them at any time.

Goldman Sachs International proposes to offer Rule 144A Notes through its selling agent, Goldman, Sachs &
Co., and Société Générale proposes to offer Rule 144A Notes through its selling agent, SG Cowen Securities.

**Belgium**

This offering memorandum is not intended to constitute a public offer in Belgium. The Belgian Banking and
Finance Commission has not reviewed or approved this document or commented on its accuracy or adequacy or
recommended or endorsed the Notes described herein.

The Notes may not be publicly offered for sale, sold or marketed in Belgium by means of a public offer under
Belgian law, nor may they be offered to any person qualifying as a consumer within the meaning of Article 1,7° of the
Law of July 14, 1991 on consumer protection and trade practices, unless such sale is made in compliance with such
law and with its implementing legislation.

Any offer to sell the Notes in Belgium will be permitted exclusively to either (i) persons who each subscribe
for a minimum of [€250,000 in principal amount of the Notes, or (ii)] qualifying institutional investors, acting for their own
account and listed in Article 3,2° of the Royal Decree of July 7, 1999 on the public character of financial transactions.

**The Netherlands**

The Notes (including rights representing an interest in a Note in global form) may only be offered in The
Netherlands, as part of their initial distribution or as part of any re-offering, and this offering memorandum may only be
distributed and circulated, and any offer of these Notes shall only be announced in writing (whether electronically or
otherwise) in The Netherlands, to individuals or legal entities who or which trade in securities in the conduct of a
business of profession ("Professional Investors," which term includes, but is not limited to, banks, securities
intermediaries (including dealers and brokers), insurance companies, pension funds, collective investment institutions,
other institutional investors and commercial enterprises with a treasury department which as an ancilliary activity
regularly invest in securities), _provided that each of the initial purchasers will undertake with the Issuer and the_
Guarantors that it will mention upon making any such offers and in any documents or advertisements in which this
offering of the Notes is announced that, in The Netherlands, an offer to sell the Notes will be made exclusively to such
Professional Investors.

224


-----

**LEGAL MATTERS**

The validity of the Notes and certain other matters relating to the offering will be passed upon for us by Cleary,
Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, our U.S., English and Belgian counsel. Certain legal matters relating to the offering will be
passed upon for the initial purchasers by Cravath, Swaine & Moore LLP, their U.S. counsel, and by Allen & Overy,
their Belgian counsel.

**INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

The annual financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 included in this
offering memorandum have been audited by independent auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers Bedrijfsrevisoren, a civil
company having the form of a cooperative company with limited liability incorporated under the laws of Belgium.

**SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF LIABILITIES**

The Issuer is a limited liability company organized under the laws of Belgium with its registered office and
principal place of business in Belgium. Its parent company and subsidiaries, including the guarantors of the Notes, are
non-residents of the United States. Most of the directors and senior management of the Issuer and the other Telenet
entities are not residents of the United States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the
United States. Substantially all of the assets of the Issuer and the guarantors of the Notes are also located outside the
United States. The Issuer and the guarantors of the Notes have agreed, in accordance with the terms of the indenture,
to accept service of process in any suit, action or proceeding with respect to the indenture, the Notes or the guarantees
of the Notes brought in any federal or state court located in The City of New York by an agent designated for such
purpose, and to submit to the jurisdiction of such courts in connection with such suits, actions or proceedings. However,
it may not be possible for you to effect service of process within the United States upon the directors and senior
management of the Issuer or the guarantors of the Notes or to enforce against these persons, or the Issuer and the
guarantors of the Notes, judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws
of the United States.

The United States currently does not have a treaty with Belgium providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, in civil and commercial matters. Consequently, a final judgment
rendered by any federal or state court in the United States, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state
securities laws, would not automatically be enforceable in Belgium.

Our Belgian counsel has advised us that a U.S. judgment may be recognized and enforced upon request by the
courts of Belgium if a Belgian court confirms the substantive correctness of the judgment of the U.S. court and is
satisfied that:

      - the judgment is not contrary to the principles of international public policy in Belgium or rules of
Belgian public law;

      - the judgment did not violate the due process rights of the defendant;

      - the judgment is not subject to further appeal under U.S. law;

      - the U.S. court did not accept its jurisdiction solely on the basis of the nationality of the plaintiff; and

      - the judgment submitted to it is authentic.

In addition, with regard to the enforcement through legal proceedings in Belgium (including the exequatur of
foreign court decisions in Belgium), a registration tax at the rate of 3% of the amount of the judgment is payable by the
debtor, if the sum of money which the debtor is ordered to pay by a Belgian court, or by a foreign court judgment that
is either (i) automatically enforceable and registered in Belgium or (ii) rendered enforceable by a Belgian court,
exceeds [€12,500. The registration tax is payable by the debtor The creditor is jointly liable up to a maximum of one-half]
of the amount the creditor recovers from the debtor.

In addition, it is questionable whether a Belgian court would accept jurisdiction and impose civil liability if

225


-----

proceedings were commenced in Belgium predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.

**WHERE YOU CAN FIND MORE INFORMATION**

If you purchase Notes from the initial purchasers, you will be furnished with a copy of this offering
memorandum and, to the extent provided by us to the initial purchasers for such purpose, any related amendment or
supplement to this offering memorandum. When you receive this offering memorandum and any such amendment or
supplement you acknowledge that:

      - you have been afforded an opportunity to request from us and to review, and have received from us,
all additional information considered by you to be necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness
of the information herein;

      - you have not relied on the initial purchasers or any person affiliated with the initial purchasers in
connection with your investigation of the accuracy of such information or your investment decision;
and

      - except in each case as provided above, no person has been authorized to give any information or to
make any representation concerning the Notes offered hereby other than those contained herein, and,
if given or made, such other information or representation should not be relied upon as having been
authorized by us or the initial purchasers.

During the period in which we are not a reporting issuer under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the
"U.S. Exchange Act") or exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) under the U.S. Exchange Act, we have agreed
that, for so long as any Notes remain outstanding and are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under
the U.S. Securities Act, we will furnish to the holders of such Notes and prospective purchasers of such Notes (as
designated by the then current holder of such Notes), upon their written request, the information required to be
delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the U.S. Securities Act. Any such request should be directed to the Issuer
at Liersesteenweg 4, B-2800 Mechelen, Belgium.

We have not been and will not be required to file reports with the SEC pursuant to the periodic reporting and
other information requirements of the U.S. Exchange Act. However, we will furnish to the holders of the Notes,
without charge, the quarterly and annual financial statements and related notes and an accompanying Management's
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the format and including substantially the
same information that would be required to be included in the periodic reports filed with the SEC if we were subject to
the information requirements of the U.S. Exchange Act.

So long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of such stock exchange so
require, copies of such information will also be available during the normal business hours on any business day at the
office of The Bank of New York (Luxembourg) SA.

**REPORTS OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS**

**Report of Independent Auditors**

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Telenet Group Holding NV:

In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related statements of operations, shareholders'
equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the successor financial position of Telenet Group Holding
NV and its subsidiaries (the "Company") at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, and the successor results of
its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of
these statements in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Belgium, as issued by the Institute of
Company Auditors, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. In accordance with those standards, we evaluated the
Company's administrative and accounting organisation, as well as its internal control procedures in respect of financial
reporting. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the
overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

TELENET GROUP HOLDING NV NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001
and for the period from January 1, 2001 to March 30, 2001
(in thousands of Euro, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)

**1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION, SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND NATURE OF OPERATIONS**

**_Basis of Presentation_**

The accompanying consolidated financial statements present the operations of Telenet Group Holding NV
("Telenet") and its subsidiaries (hereafter collectively referred to as the "Company"). The consolidated statement of
operations is split between successor and predecessor periods to reflect the acquisition of Telenet Holding NV
("Telenet Holding") and its subsidiaries Telenet Operaties NV ("Telenet Operaties") and Telenet Vlaanderen NV
("Telenet Vlaanderen") on March 30, 2001. The successor was incorporated as Telenet BidCo NV ("BidCo") on
December 1, 2000 and prior to March 30, 2001 did not have any activities. BidCo, Telenet HoldCo NV and Telenet are
each limited liability companies organized under Belgian law.

**_Acquisition of Telenet Holding_**

BidCo acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Telenet Holding and its subsidiaries on March 30, 2001 for
an aggregate purchase price of approximately [€1,683,260 plus transaction costs of €38,556 (the "Telenet Holding]
Acquisition"). The Telenet Holding Acquisition was financed by the issuance of subordinated vendor notes ("Vendor
Notes") in an aggregate principal amount of [€810,750 (see Note] 7) and approximately 8.7 million shares of BidCo with
a fair value of approximately [€872,510.]

The Telenet Holding Acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and, accordingly,
all assets and liabilities of Telenet Holding and its subsidiaries have been recorded at their fair value as of the date of
acquisition. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets and liabilities has been recorded as
goodwill. The purchase price (including transaction costs) was allocated to the net assets acquired based on their
estimated fair values as follows:

Current assets, including cash acquired of [€8,802]..................................................................................... 42,758
Fixed assets.......................................................................................................................................... 460,748
Liabilities assumed................................................................................................................................. (683,683)
Identifiable intangible assets................................................................................................................... 364,490
Goodwill ............................................................................................................................................... 1,537,503
1,721,816

BidCo completed and finalized its purchase price allocation related to the Telenet Holding Acquisition during
2001, which resulted in approximately [€174,000 of additional intangible assets.]

**_Acquisition of MixtICS NV_**

The Company acquired MixtICS NV ("MixtICS") in August 2002 (see Note 3). In connection with the
acquisition of MixtICS, the shareholders of BidCo contributed their shares in BidCo to Telenet HoldCo NV ("HoldCo")
in exchange for the issuance of new shares in HoldCo. Subsequently, all of the shareholders of HoldCo contributed
their shares in HoldCo to Telenet in exchange for the issuance of new shares in Telenet. These exchanges of shares
were made on a one-for-one basis.

**_Nature of Operations_**

The Company is a provider of broadband cable services in Belgium. Through its broadband network in
Flanders, the Company offers analog cable television, broadband Internet and telephony services, primarily to

241


-----

residential subscribers. The Company is managed and operates in one operating segment, broadband communications.

In 1996, the Pure Intercommunale Companies ("PICs"), through Interkabel Vlaanderen CVBA ("Interkabel"),
and the Mixed Intercommunale Companies ("MICs") entered into contracts with Telenet Vlaanderen granting it a one
percent ownership interest in the original MICs cable network and exclusive user rights to a certain bandwidth in
exchange for Telenet Vlaanderen shares which were exchanged for Telenet Holding shares. The contracts called for
the original cable network to be upgraded to allow for two-way communication (the "HFC Upgrade"). Originally, the
MICs and PICs were responsible for the HFC Upgrade, along with the maintenance of the Network. Upon the
acquisition of MixtICS, the Company became responsible for the HFC Upgrade and maintenance of the portion of the
Network previously owned by the MICs.

The MICs are separate legal entities individually owned by a number of Belgian "communes" (local municipal
and provincial governments) and one or more private companies, principally, Electrabel SA ("Electrabel") which is a
related party of the Company. Electrabel is a Belgian energy company whose main activities include the generation,
trading, distribution and sales of electricity, natural gas and derived energy products and services. The activities of
some of the MICs include the distribution of electricity, gas, cable broadcasting and water through a dedicated
distribution network in Belgium.

The MICs are detailed as follows:

**MICs providing multiple distribution services:** **MICs providing only cable services:**

Gaselwest CVBA Interteve CVBA
Imea CVBA Telekempo CVBA
Intergem CVBA Tevelo CVBA
Iveka CVBA Teveoost NV
Iverlek CVBA (I, II & III) Tevewest NV

The PICs are separate legal entities (i.e., Interelectra CVBA; Integan CVBA; WVEM CV; Havi-TV CV;
PBE CVBA and VEM CVBA referred to hereafter, collectively, as the "PICs") owned by local municipal and
provincial governments. In their relationship with the Company, the PICs operate through Interkabel, which is a related
party of the Company (Note 15).

TELENET GROUP HOLDING NV NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001
and for the period from January 1, 2001 to March 30, 2001
(in thousands of Euro, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)

**2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally
Accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The Company's functional and reporting currency is euros
("[€"), which is also the functional currency of each of the Company's subsidiaries.]

**_Management's Use of Estimates_**

The presentation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

**_Basis of Consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements of the successor include the accounts of Telenet and all entities that it
directly or indirectly controls. The consolidated financial statements of the predecessor include the accounts of Telenet
Holding and all entities that it directly or indirectly controls. All intercompany accounts and transactions among
consolidated entities have been eliminated.

**_Cash and Cash Equivalents_**

Cash equivalents consist principally of money market funds and certificates of deposit with maturities of three
months or less when purchased. The carrying amounts of the Company's cash equivalents approximate their fair value.

**_Property and Equipment_**

Property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:

Buildings and improvements................................................................................................................. 33 years
Operating facilities............................................................................................................................... 3-20 years
Other equipment.................................................................................................................................. 3-10 years

Prior to the acquisition of the MixtICS, the 1% co-ownership in the existing cable network with the MICs was
depreciated on a straight-line basis over 20 years. However, upon the purchase of MixtICS, the Company began
depreciating the acquired Network as operating facilities.

The costs associated with the construction of cable transmission and distribution facilities and also Internet and
telephony service installations are capitalized and depreciated over 3 to 20 years. Costs include all direct labor and
materials as well as certain indirect costs. Costs associated with subsequent installations of additional services are
capitalized, and subsequently depreciated over 3 to 10 years, to the extent that they are incremental and directly
attributable to the installation of expanded services; costs associated with subsequent disconnection of existing
customers are expensed as incurred.

Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to operating expense as incurred.

Typically, interest costs incurred during the construction period (i.e. the period of time necessary to bring a
constructed fixed asset to the condition and location necessary for its intended use) are capitalized. The capitalized
interest is recorded as part of the asset to which it relates and is amortized over the fixed asset's estimated useful life.

243


-----

Capitalized interest was nil for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 as there were no qualifying assets during
such period.

**_Goodwill and Intangible Assets_**

Goodwill and intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization is computed using
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives as follows:

Goodwill .......................................................................... 15 years (prior to January 1, 2002)
Network user rights.......................................................... 10-20 years
Customer lists .................................................................. 15 years
Trade name ..................................................................... 15 years
Software development costs.............................................. 3 years (but not exceeding the expected life)

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 142,
_Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS No. 142"), which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets_
with indefinite useful lives, including those recorded in past business combinations, no longer be amortized, but instead
be tested for impairment at least annually. The standard also requires the completion of a transitional impairment test
with any resulting impairment identified treated as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. See Note 6
for additional information.

Prior to its adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company assessed goodwill for impairment based on the guidance
in SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to Be Disposed
_Of ("SFAS No. 121")._

**_Software Development and Acquisition Costs_**

Costs associated with software developed or obtained for internal use are capitalized when both the
preliminary project stage is completed and the Company's management has authorized further funding for the project,
which it deems probable of completion and use for the function intended. Capitalized internal-use software costs
include only (1) external direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining the software,
(2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who are directly associated with and who devote time to the project,
and (3) interest costs incurred, when material, while developing the software. Capitalization of these costs ceases no
later than the point at which the project is substantially complete and ready for its intended purpose.

Research and development costs and other computer software maintenance costs related to software
development are expensed as incurred.

**_Impairment of Long-Lived Assets_**

On January 1, 2002, the Company adopted SFAS No. 144, _Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of_
_Long-Lived Assets ("SFAS No. 144"), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment and_
disposition of long-lived assets. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets, other than indefinite
lived intangible assets and goodwill, for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Indications of impairment are determined by reviewing undiscounted
projected future cash flows. If an impairment is indicated, it is measured as the amount by which the carrying value
exceeds the fair value of the asset.

Prior to the adoption of SFAS No. 144, the Company followed the provisions in SFAS No. 121.

**_Financial Instruments_**

The Company accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133,
_Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities ("SFAS No. 133") and related interpretations and_
amendments. SFAS No. 133 requires the recognition of derivatives as assets or liability on a company's balance sheet

244


-----

and the measurement of those instruments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in
earnings, unless (i) the normal purchase or sale exception or (ii) hedge, other than fair value hedges, accounting is
elected. The Company has determined that its outstanding derivative instruments do not qualify for normal purchase
and sale exception or hedge accounting; therefore all changes in the fair value of these instruments are recognized as a
gain or loss within the statement of operations.

Moreover, SFAS No. 133 also requires certain embedded derivatives to be separated from the host contracts
and recorded as either an asset or a liability on a company's balance sheet, measured at fair value. Specifically, if the
economic characteristics of an embedded derivative instrument and its host contract are not clearly and closely related,
SFAS No. 133 requires that the embedded derivative instrument be separated (bifurcated) and accounted for as a
stand- alone derivative instrument. The Company has determined that it has no embedded derivative instruments that
are required to be bifurcated and measured at fair value.

**_Warrants_**

Detachable warrants to purchase shares issued in connection with debt are accounted for under Accounting
Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 14, Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase
_Warrants ("APB Opinion No. 14"). Accordingly, the portion of the proceeds of debt securities issued with detachable_
warrants to purchase shares, which is allocable to those warrants, is accounted for as paid-in capital. The allocation is
based on the relative fair values of the two securities at the time of issuance. Any resulting discount or premium on the
debt securities is recognized using the effective interest rate method over the contractual term of the debt.

The Company accounts for freestanding warrants in accordance with Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF")
Issue No. 00-19, _Accounting for Derivative Financial Instruments Indexed to, and Potentially Settled in, a_
_Company's Own Stock as interpreted by EITF Issue No. 01-6,_ _The Meaning of "Indexed to a Company's Own_
_Stock". Accordingly, the Company assesses whether these warrants are to be classified within shareholder's equity or_
as a liability. Warrants accounted for as permanent equity are recorded at their initial fair value and subsequent
changes in fair value are not recognized unless a change in the classification of those warrants occurs. Warrants not
qualifying for permanent equity accounting are recorded at fair value as a liability with subsequent changes in fair value
recognized through the statement of operations.

**_Deferred Financing Costs_**

Costs associated with the refinancing and issuance of debt as well as debt discounts, if any, are deferred and
expensed as interest over the term of the related debt agreement using the effective interest rate method.

**_Foreign Currency Transactions_**

Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are reported at the exchange rates prevailing at year-end and
any resulting gains and losses are included in the consolidated statement of operations.

**_Stock-Based Compensation_**

The Company accounts for its stock-based compensation plan, which is more fully described in Note 11, under
the intrinsic value method, which follows the recognition and measurement principles of APB Opinion No. 25,
_Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees ("APB Opinion No. 25"), Financial Accounting Standards Board_
("FASB") Interpretation No. 44, _Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation (an_
_Interpretation of APB Opinion No. 25), and EITF Issue No. 00-23,_ _Issues Related to the Accounting for Stock_
_Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44. Pro forma net loss disclosures_
required by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation ("SFAS No. 123"), are included in Note 11.

**_Revenue Recognition_**

We account for the revenue, costs and expenses related to cable television, Internet and telephony services as
the related services are performed in accordance with SFAS No. 51, _Financial Reporting by Cable Television_
_Companies ("SFAS No. 51")._

245


-----

Installation revenue for cable television, Internet and telephony services is recognized to the extent of direct
selling costs incurred. The remainder is deferred and amortized to income over the estimated average period that
subscribers are expected to remain connected to the system. Based on a review of historical data, the average
subscriber period for cable television customers is currently estimated as being 10 years. Direct selling costs have
exceeded installation revenue in all reported periods for Internet and telephony services. As a result, installation
revenue was recognized as new subscribers were connected to our network.

In compliance with SFAS No. 51, we capitalize initial subscriber installation costs. These installation costs are
depreciated over a period no longer than the period used for the network. Installation costs relating to our broadband
Internet and telephony business are depreciated over a period of five years. Installation costs relating to the cable
television are depreciated over 20 years, which is in line with the depreciation of the cable television plant.

**_Operating Expenses_**

Operating expenses consist of interconnection costs, network operating and maintenance and repair costs and
cable programming costs. We exclude depreciation from our operating expenses and capitalize most of our installation
cost, including labour cost. Copyright fees paid to copyright beneficiaries and their agents are the primary component of
the Company's cable programming costs. Other direct costs include costs that the Company incurs in connection with
providing its residential and business services, such as interconnection charges as well as bad debt expense. Network
costs consist of costs associated with operating, maintaining and repairing the Company's broadband network and
customer care costs necessary to maintain its customer base.

**_Fair Values_**

The Company has estimated the fair value of its financial instruments in these consolidated financial statements
using available market information or other appropriate valuation methodologies. Considerable judgment, however, is
required in interpreting market data to develop the estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the estimates presented herein
are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize in a current market exchange. The use of
different market assumptions and/or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value
amounts. The carrying amount of cash, accounts and other receivables, and accounts and other payables approximates
fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments.

**_Income Taxes_**

The Company provides for income taxes using the liability method in accordance with SFAS No. 109,
_Accounting for Income Taxes ("SFAS No. 109"). SFAS No. 109 requires an asset and liability-based approach in_
accounting for income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect on future years of temporary differences
between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes and for operating
loss and tax credit carryforwards. The financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of
enactment.

Valuation allowances reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that represents management's best estimate of
such deferred tax assets that more likely than not will be realized. In view of the Company's history of losses, all
deferred tax assets have been subject to a full valuation allowance.

**_Pensions_**

The Company provides defined benefit and defined contribution plans to its employees, directors and certain
members of management. These plans are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 87, _Employers' Accounting_
_for Pensions ("SFAS No. 87"). The assets of these plans are held in separate funds. The funds are funded by_
payments from the participants and the Company. During the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, the
Company's only defined benefit plan was accounted for as a defined contribution plan due to its insignificance.
Accordingly, contributions to the funds of all existing plans are recognized as an expense in the period in which the
employee renders the related service.

**_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_**

246


-----

In June 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, _Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations ("SFAS_
No. 143"). SFAS No. 143 establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability at fair value
for an asset retirement obligation and an addition to the associated asset retirement cost. The accretion of interest
expense each period is subsequently recorded as an operating expense and added to the liability. SFAS No. 143 is
effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS No. 143 on January 1, 2003
which had no material impact on its results of operations and financial position.

In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, _Rescission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64,_
_Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections ("SFAS No. 145"). SFAS No. 145 rescinds_
SFAS No. 4, _Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt, which required all gains and losses from_
the extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and, if material, classified as an extraordinary item, net of related income
tax effect. SFAS No. 145, which is effective in periods beginning after May 15, 2002, requires that gains or losses from
the extinguishment of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria of APB Opinion No. 30.
The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 145 on January 1, 2003, which had no material effect on its
consolidated financial statements.

In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, _Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal_
_Activities ("SFAS No. 146"). This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with_
exit or disposal activities and nullifies EITF Issue No. 94-3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination
_Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring) ("EITF Issue_
No. 94-3"). SFAS No. 146 eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in EITF Issue
No. 94-3. SFAS No. 146 requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized
when the liability is incurred. Under EITF Issue No. 94-3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an
entity's commitment to an exit plan. Under SFAS No. 146, an entity's commitment to a plan, by itself, does not create a
present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability. SFAS No. 146 establishes that fair value is the
objective for initial measurement of the liability. SFAS No. 146 is effective for all exit or disposal activities initiated
after December 31, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS No. 146 on January 1, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 146
had no impact on the Company's results of operations and financial position.

In November 2002, the EITF reached a final consensus related to _Revenue Arrangement with Multiple_
_Deliverables ("EITF Issue No. 00-21"). The consensus requires that revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables_
should be divided into separate units of accounting if (a) a delivered item has value to the customer on a stand-alone
basis, (b) there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item and (c) if the arrangement
includes a general right of return, delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and
substantially in the control of the vendor. Arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of
accounting based on their relative fair value and appropriate revenue recognition criteria would be applied to each
separate unit of accounting. EITF agreed the effective date for the consensus will be for all revenue arrangements
entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003, with early adoption permitted. The Company is still
evaluating the impact of this EITF on its financial statements. This EITF will be effective for the Company for revenue
arrangements entered into after January 1, 2004.

In November 2002, the FASB issued interpretation No. 45, _Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure_
_Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others ("FIN No. 45"). FIN_
No. 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value, which is different from current practice, which is
generally to record a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. FIN No. 45 also requires a
guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee
is remote. The disclosure provisions of FIN No. 45 were effective immediately in 2002. The Company is required to
adopt the recognition and measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 on a prospective basis with respect to guarantees
issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The Company does not believe the adoption of the recognition and
measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 will have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements. The
Company adopted the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 on January 1, 2003, which
had no material impact on the Company's results of operations and financial positions.

In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, _Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation,_
_Transition and Disclosure ("SFAS No. 148"). SFAS No. 148 provides alternative methods of transition for a_
voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock-based employee compensation. SFAS No. 148
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock-based

247


-----

employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format. Additionally, SFAS No. 148 requires
disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements. The transition and annual disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 148 are effective for fiscal years ended after December 15, 2002. The interim disclosure requirements of
SFAS No. 148 are effective for interim periods beginning after December 15, 2002. The Company adopted SFAS
No. 148 in the year ended December 31, 2002 which had no material impact on its results of operations and financial
position as the Company continues to apply the provisions in APB Opinion No. 25.

In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, _Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities ("FIN_
No. 46") which interprets Accounting Research Bulletin (ARB) 51, _Consolidated Financial Statements ("ARB 51")._
FIN No. 46 clarifies the application of ARB 51 with respect to the consolidation of certain entities (variable interest
entities—"VIEs") to which the usual condition for consolidation described in ARB 51 does not apply because the
controlling financial interest in VIEs may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests. In
addition, FIN No. 46 requires the primary beneficiary of VIEs and the holder of a significant variable interest in VIEs
to disclose certain information relating to their involvement with the VIEs. The provisions of FIN No. 46 apply
immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and to VIEs in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that
date. FIN No. 46 applies in the first fiscal year beginning after June 15, 2003, to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a
variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. The Company does not believe that the impact of the
adoption of FIN No. 46 will have a material effect on its financial statements.

In April 2003 the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of SFAS No. 133 on Derivative Instruments and
_Hedging Activities ("SFAS No. 149"). The Statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments,_
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. In
particular, it (1) clarifies under what circumstances a contract with an initial net investment meets the characteristic of
a derivative as discussed in SFAS No. 133, (2) clarifies when a derivative contains a financing component, (3) amends
the definition of an underlying to conform it to the language used in FIN No. 45 and (4) amends certain other existing
pronouncements. Most of the provisions in SFAS No. 149 are effective for contracts entered into or modified after
June 30, 2003. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this Statement will have a material impact on its
results of operations and financial position.

In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, _Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with_
_Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity ("SFAS No. 150"). SFAS No. 150 establishes standards for how an_
issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. In accordance with SFAS No. 150, certain financial instruments that embody obligations of
the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or
modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise shall be effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after
June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 is not expected to have a material
impact on the Company`s financial condition or results of operations.

**3.  ACQUISITION OF MIXTICS**

On 21 February 2001, Callahan Investco Belgium 1 Sa rl, a limited liability company organized under
Luxembourg law ("CAI Belgium"), HoldCo, BidCo and the MICs entered into a put option agreement pursuant to
which the MICs were granted the option to contribute all of their cable activities to MixtICS, a limited liability company
organized under Belgian law, and to subsequently transfer all of the shares in MixtICS to BidCo (the "MixtICS Put
Option").

On June 8, 2001, the MICs exercised the MixtICS Put Option and, pursuant to the terms of the MixtICS Put
Option, on June 15, 2001, a Share Transfer Agreement was signed between Callahan Belgium, Bidco, Holdco and the
MICs, to sell the shares of MixtICS, holding certain assets and liabilities of the cable activities of the MICs operating in
the Flemish region of Belgium, to Bidco and Holdco (the "MixtICS Acquisition").

The MixtICS Put Option originally expired on June 11, 2001, however, due to market conditions at that time,
the parties agreed to extend the maturity date of the MixtICS Put Option. In August 2002, the MixtICS Acquisition
was completed. Upon the closing of the MixtICS Acquisition on August 9, 2002, the MICs transferred shares of
MixtICS to BidCo in exchange for consideration consisting of cash, certain deferred payment obligations and newly
issued shares of BidCo and warrants for Telenet shares. Callahan Belgium, JP Morgan, Merrill Lynch, Electrabel,
GIMV, the Financial Consortium and Interkabel acquired, directly or indirectly, the remainder of the shares of MixtICS,

248


-----

which were thereafter contributed to BidCo. In addition, all the Vendor Notes were transferred by the holders in
exchange for newly issued shares in BidCo and the warrants issued to Callahan Belgium upon the closing of the
Telenet Holding Acquisition, were surrendered in consideration for options to purchase shares in the Company from
other shareholders.

Additionally, all the shareholders of BidCo contributed their shares in BidCo to HoldCo in exchange for the
issuance of new shares in HoldCo, and subsequently all of the shareholders of HoldCo contributed their shares in
HoldCo to Telenet in exchange for the issuance of new shares in Telenet. These exchanges of shares were made on a
one-for-one basis.

The total consideration equaled [€930,309 based on estimated fair values of the issued debt, warrants and]
ordinary shares. The total consideration included [€363,000 of cash, €314,932 in debt, € 201,465 in equity, €23,691 in]
warrants and [€ 27,221 of transaction costs. The purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired based on their]
estimated fair values as follows (preliminary allocation):

Current assets, net of cash acquired....................................................................................................... 44,026
Fixed assets.......................................................................................................................................... 430,252
Intangible assets.................................................................................................................................... 244
Non-current assets................................................................................................................................ 99,403
Liabilities assumed................................................................................................................................. (204,968)
Goodwill ............................................................................................................................................... 561,352
930,309

The above purchase price allocation is preliminary with respect to the valuation of fixed assets acquired and
liabilities assumed. In addition to the debt assumed by the sellers of MixtICS, the transaction was financed by a new
credit facility totaling [€1,250,000 (of which €825,000 was drawn to refinance existing debt and to finance a portion of]
the purchase price), two loans from different groups of shareholders totaling [€73,000 and €162,000 raised by issuing]
additional equity to existing shareholders. The equity shares issued as consideration for the purchase of MixtICS were
valued at [€50 per share based on the price paid by the existing shareholders for additional shares of Telenet issued on]
the same day. Telenet also issued six different classes of detachable warrants of which three are contingently
exercisable if debt payments are not made in accordance with the agreement or if additional equity shares are issued
below a certain price. The terms and conditions of the debt instruments issued in connection with the MixtICS
Acquisition are discussed at Note 7 and the warrants at Note 12.

The unaudited pro forma financial information below assumes that the Company acquired MixtICS at the
beginning of 2001 and includes the effect of amortization of goodwill and other acquired identifiable intangible assets
from that date. The financial information also includes the results from Telenet Holding for the period from January 1,

**6.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142 in January 2002, the Company completed a transitional
impairment test of its goodwill. Goodwill was computed based on one reporting unit.

Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flows using reasonable and appropriate assumptions that
are consistent with internal forecasts. As a result, the Company determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of [€667,628 for year ended December] 2002. The charge

250


-----

reflects overall market declines since the Telenet Holding Acquisition and is not operational in nature. The tax impact
recorded on the impairment is nil as a full valuation allowance is applied against all net deferred tax assets as discussed
in Note 10.

The Company's other intangible assets which each have a finite life are comprised primarily of network user
rights, software development and acquisition costs, customer lists, and trade name. These intangible assets are
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company evaluates the estimated useful lives of
its finite intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events or circumstances warrant revised
estimates of useful lives. In connection with the Telenet Holding Acquisition and the MixtICS Acquisition, certain
identifiable intangible assets, including customer lists and the "Telenet" trade name, were recorded separate from
goodwill. The identified intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over 10 to 20 years, except for software
development costs which are amortized on a straight line basis over 3 years.

Summarized below are the carrying value and accumulated amortization of intangible assets that will continue
to be amortized under SFAS No. 142, as well as the carrying amount of goodwill, which will no longer be amortized.

Aggregate amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2002 was [€36,455. The Company estimates]
amortization expense to be [€30,400 in 2003, and €15,900 per annum in 2004 through 2007. Actual amortization expense]
to be reported in future periods could differ from these estimates as a result of new intangible asset acquisitions,
changes in useful lives and other relevant factors.

As required, SFAS No. 142 has not been retroactively applied to the results for the period prior to adoption. A

**_Bank Facilities_**

_2001 Facility_

On March 29, 2001, Telenet Operaties obtained a credit facility for an amount of [€550,000 (the "2001]
Facility"). The rate of interest payable on a loan for any interest period under this facility was the aggregate of the
applicable margin and Euribor. The terms of the 2001 Facility originally provided for a maturity date of March 29, 2002.
This maturity was subsequently extended to August 9, 2002. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, outstanding
borrowings were nil and [€475,000, respectively. The 2001 Facility included certain general and financial covenants.]
Throughout the term of this facility, the Company was in compliance with all of its covenants.

_2002 Facility_

In connection with the MixtICS Acquisition, the Company obtained in July 2002 a senior secured facility for a
total of up to [€1,250,000 of financing from a syndicate of lenders in the following tranches (the "2002 Facility"):]

       - Tranche A: The Tranche A facility provides for an amortizing term loan and guarantee facility expiring
in 2009 for up to [€825,000 to be used to refinance the Company's existing indebtedness; to finance the]
cash element of the consideration, including certain transaction costs, for the MixtICS Acquisition, and
to refinance existing working capital facilities. Amounts under the facility bear interest at Euribor plus
a margin of up to 3.25%. This margin decreases over time to the extent that the Company's leverage is
reduced. A commitment fee of 0.75% per annum is payable on the undrawn balance of the facility. As
of December 31, 2002, outstanding borrowings were [€825,000.]

       - Tranche B: The Tranche B facility provides for an amortizing revolving credit facility, expiring in 2009,
of up to [€125,000 to be used principally to finance the Company's working capital and capital]
expenditure requirements and to provide financing for potential future acquisitions. Amounts under the

252


-----

facility bear interest at Euribor plus a margin of up to 3.25%. This margin decreases over time to the
extent that the Company's leverage is reduced. A commitment fee of 0.75% per annum is payable on
the undrawn balance of the facility. As of December 31, 2002, outstanding borrowings were [€25,000]
and undrawn availability was [€ 100,000.]

      - Tranche C: The Tranche C facility provides for two term facilities, one with a principal amount of
€100,000 ("C1"), which is also an amortizing term loan, and the other with a principal amount of
€150,000 ("C2"), to be used principally to finance the deferred element of consideration payable for the
MixtICS Acquisition. The C1 facility matures in 2009 and the C2 facility matures in 2010. Amounts
under the facilities bear interest at Euribor plus a margin of up to 2.625% and 4.0% for C1 and C2,
respectively. These margins decrease over time to the extent that the Company's leverage is reduced.
A commitment fee of 0.75% on both term loans is payable on the undrawn balance of each facility. As
of December 31, 2002, total outstanding borrowings were [€60,000 and total undrawn availability was]
€190,000.

      - Tranche D: The Tranche D facility provides for a revolving credit facility, expiring in 2009, of [€50,000]
to be used for general corporate purposes. Amounts under the facility bear interest at Euribor plus a
margin of up to 3.25%. This margin decreases over time to the extent that the Company's leverage is
reduced. A quarterly commitment fee of 0.75% per annum is payable on the undrawn balance of the
facility. The Company has not drawn this facility.

The credit facilities contain representations and warranties, covenants, information requirements, events of
default and financial covenants. The availability of the undrawn credit facilities is subject to meeting certain covenant
and access tests. The financial covenants, which are tested on a quarterly basis based on Belgian GAAP figures,
measure performance against, among others, standards for leverage, debt service coverage, revenues, and earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization ("EBITDA"). Additionally, the agreements contain provisions
requiring mandatory loan prepayments under specific circumstances. As of December 31, 2002, the Company was in
compliance with all of its financial covenants.

Obligations under the bank facilities are guaranteed and cross-guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of Telenet.
The obligations are also secured by mortgages and by pledges of certain equity interests, material contracts, and other
rights and claims held by certain of Telenet's subsidiaries.

The security agents, on behalf of the underwriters of the bank facilities, were granted 100,000 detachable
warrants to purchase ordinary shares of the Company ("Bank Warrants") (see Note 12). As a consequence of the
allocation of a portion of the proceeds of the bank facilities to the relative fair value of these warrants, the Company
recognized a discount on these facilities.

These facilities were partially amended and drawn in 2003 (see Note 17).

**_Mezzanine Subordinated Bonds_**

In connection with the Company's acquisition of MixtICS, the Company issued [€50,000 of mezzanine]
subordinated bonds due in 2007. The bonds bear interest semi-annually at 8.5%, and at 14% on any overdue amounts
and are generally redeemable at the option of the Company. The bonds were issued with 1.6 million detachable
warrants to purchase ordinary shares of the Company ("Mezzanine Warrants") (see Note 12). As a consequence of
the allocation of a portion of the proceeds of the bonds to the relative fair value of these warrants, the Company
recognized a discount on these bonds.

**_GAP Filling Bonds_**

In connection with the Company's acquisition of MixtICS, the Company issued [€23,000 of bonds due in 2003 in]
an amount of [€6,000 to the Financial Consortium (consisting of Finstrad NV, Gevaert NV, Ibel NV, KBC Bank NV,]
KBC Verzekeringen NV (KBC Insurance) and Sofinim NV), [€15,000 to GIMV NV and €2,000 to Callahan Belgium.]
The bonds bear interest annually at 13%, are repayable on maturity with a 6% premium, and are generally redeemable
at the option of the Company. Subject to certain conditions being met by the Company, the stated maturity date may be
extended to 2006. The bonds were issued with 460,000 detachable warrants to purchase ordinary shares of the

253


-----

Company ("GAP Warrants") (see Note 12). As a consequence of the allocation of a portion of the proceeds of the
bonds to the relative fair value of these warrants, the Company recognized a discount on these bonds.

**_Deferrals_**

The Company entered into an agreement with the sellers of the MixtICS, to pay an additional amount of
€330,575 plus interest. This agreement comprises two different arrangements, Deferral A and B, as follows:

**Deferral A** **Deferral B**


Principal Amount at

October 31, 2003............................................ €5,058

Contingent event: Compliance with the 2002 Facility First Agreed Equity Increase
Availability Tests

___________

(a) Includes interest accruals from February through August 2002 on various components of the purchase price.

(b) Late payment interest rate increases yearly by 1% up to a maximum of 16% beginning on June 1, 2005.

Deferral A has been classified as a long-term debt on the balance sheet as it will be repaid using proceeds
from the 2002 Facility subject to meeting the availability tests. The maturity dates of Deferral A are extended if these
tests are not met.

Deferral A and B were issued with 1.6 million detachable warrants to purchase ordinary shares of the
Company ("Deferral Conversion Warrants" and "Penny Warrants") (see Note 12). As a consequence of the allocation
of a portion of the principal amount of Deferral B to the relative fair value of these warrants, the Company recognized
a discount on Deferral B.

In addition to Deferrals A and B, the Company has also to repay [€ 81,000 representing the amounts payable to]
the sellers of MixtICS for the upgrades of the MICs' cable network ("Deferred HFC Upgrade Amount"). This balance
bears late payment interest of 13% from February 1, 2002 through the date of payment and 14% from June 1, 2003
through the date of payment. The late payment interest rate increases yearly by 1% up to a maximum of 16%
beginning on June 1, 2005.

**_Vendor Notes_**

Subordinated vendor notes in the amount of [€810,750 were issued on March] 29, 2001 to GIMV ([€216,204), the]
Financial Consortium ([€ 216,204), Interkabel (€132,410) and the MICs (€245,932) upon the acquisition of the Telenet]
Holding shares by BidCo. These notes bore interest at Euribor plus a margin of up to 10.00%. Vendor notes
outstanding at December 31, 2001 include accrued interest of [€67,979.]

In connection with the Company's acquisition of MixtICS, the vendor notes were contributed to the Company
and BidCo shares were given in exchange.

**_Clientele and Annuity Agreements_**

In 1996, the Company entered into a Clientele Agreement with the MICs and the PICs and into an Annuity

254


-----

Agreement with the PICs.

The clientele fee payable under the Clientele Agreement is payable by the Company in return for access to the
cable network customer database owned and controlled by the MICs and PICs. The clientele fee is payable as long as
the Company maintains its usage rights to the cable network, and is adjusted periodically depending on the level of
inflation. Such payments allow the MICs and the PICs to recover part of their historical HFC Upgrade Investment.

Considering this, the present value of the clientele fee payments over the first 20 years (being the life of the
longest lived assets that are part of the HFC Upgrade) has been accounted for as network user rights under intangible
assets, and is amortized over 10 or 20 years depending on the useful life of the underlying assets that make up the HFC
Upgrade.

In connection with the MixtICS Acquisition, the Company acquired full control of the portion of the HFC
Upgrade previously owned by the MICs. Consequently, the balance of the clientele fee payable as of December 31,
2002 reflects solely the Company's outstanding obligation to the PICs.

In accordance with the terms of the Annuity Agreement, the PICs charge an annuity fee, which in substance
covers the remaining 60% of the cost of the HFC Upgrade incurred by the PICs, to the Company. Payments under the
Annuity Agreement are due over a period of 10 or 20 years, depending on the useful life of the underlying assets that
make up the HFC Upgrade incurred by the PICs. The present value of the future payments under the Annuity
Agreement has been capitalized as network user rights under intangible assets, and is amortized over 10 or 20 years
depending on the useful life of the underlying assets that make up the HFC Upgrade.

**9.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

The Company seeks to reduce its foreign currency exposure through a policy of matching, to the extent
possible, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company uses financial instruments in
order to manage its exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations arising from its operations. As discussed in
Note 2, the Company has elected not to account for these instruments as hedges. The Company is also exposed to
credit risks.

**_Foreign Exchange Risk_**

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the Company would incur as a result of non-performance by
counterparties. The Company maintains credit risk policies with regard to its counterparties to minimize overall credit
risk. These policies include an evaluation of a potential counterparty's financial condition, credit rating, and other credit

criteria and risk mitigation tools as deemed appropriate.

The largest share of the gross assets subject to credit risk is accounts receivable from residential and small
commercial customers. The risk of material loss from nonperformance from these customers is not considered likely.
Reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable are provided for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers
based on historical experience.

In regards to credit risk on financial instruments, the Company maintains a policy of entering into such
transactions only with highly rated European and U.S. financial institutions.

(in thousands of Euro, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)

As of December 31, 2002, Telenet and its subsidiaries had available combined cumulative tax loss
carry-forwards of [€890,872 and investment credits of €59,730. Under current Belgian tax laws, these loss]
carry-forwards and investment credits have an indefinite life and may be used to offset the future taxable income of
Telenet and its subsidiaries. As Telenet and virtually all of its subsidiaries have never realized any taxable profits, a
100% valuation allowance has been recorded resulting in a net deferred tax asset of zero. The valuation allowance
increased in 2002 by [€112,502 as a result of the changes in the deferred tax assets and liabilities offset by a decrease in]
the new tax rate.

Effective January 1, 2003, the Belgian statutory tax rate decreased from 40.17% to 33.99%. The deferred tax
assets and liabilities have been computed at December 31, 2002 using the new tax rate with an impact of [€54,650.]

**11.  BENEFIT PLANS**

The Company has two defined contribution plans (one for its employees and one for certain members of
management) and one defined benefit plan only for certain members of management.

The Company contributes to the defined contribution plans approximately 200% and 500% of the employee's
and member of management's contribution, respectively. However, the participants' contribution is limited to a certain
percentage of their salaries.

The participants of the pension plans described above are fully vested after one year of service. Also, such
plans are available to all employees and certain members of management that are at least 25 years old and have a
permanent employment contract.

As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the defined benefit plan had 8 and 7 participants, respectively. The
defined benefit plan was accounted for as a defined contribution plan due to its insignificance.

A group insurance plan is available to the certain members of management having a minimum age of 25.
Rights are immediately vested, with the exception of rights built up through employer contribution during the first year
of participation in the plan.

The Company's contributions for all of these plans totaled [€1,025 and €965 in the years ended December] 31,
2002 and 2001, respectively. As discussed in Note 2, these amounts were expensed as incurred.

**12.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY**

**_Employee Stock Based Compensation_**

260


-----

On November 23, 1999 (the "1999 Plan") and September 25, 1998 (the "1998 Plan"), Telenet Holding granted
options to certain employees to purchase 77,500 and 42,250 of its shares, respectively, at an exercise price of [€24.79]
per share which was below the fair market value at the time of issuance. These options generally vest 33[ 1]/3 percent on
the anniversary of the date of the grant for three years. Unvested options forfeit upon termination of employment,
initiated by either the employer or the Company, unless the Human Resource Committee decides to grant an exception.

Options granted in 1999 fully vested in January 2003 and can be exercised annually from 2003 to 2009 in the
months March, June, September and December, with the exception of the last exercise period that runs from
November 1 to November 15, 2009.

Options granted in 1998 fully vested in March 2002 and can be exercised annually from 2002 to 2008 in the
months March, June, September and December, with the exception of the last exercise period that runs from
November 1 to November 30, 2008.

In October 2001, the holders of options have been granted the contractual right pursuant to which they are
entitled to sell 55% of the Telenet Holding shares, which they obtain upon the exercise of the options, to Callahan at the
fair value of such shares at the time of exercise of the put option. The put option expires 8 days after the exercise of
the related options and is only exercisable between March 1, 2002 and March 30, 2002, and January 1, 2003 and
January 20, 2003 for the 1998 and 1999 options, respectively. The fair market value will be the valuation used in the
most recent substantial transaction in which shares are issued to an unrelated party, or, of more recent, the market
value determined for the purpose of the granting of new employee stock options.

As result of the put option being granted to employees in October 2001, the 1998 and 1999 plans were
determined to have been modified for this share repurchase feature and will be accounted for as variable plans.
Accordingly, compensation expense for either increases or decreases in the fair value of the shares will be recognized
for the 1998 Plan from October 2001 to March 2002 and for the 1999 Plan from October 2001 to January 2003.

Also in October 2001, following the restructuring of the Company, Telenet Holding, on behalf of Telenet,
granted to the option holders an additional contractual rights to convert shares, which they obtain upon the exercise of
options to purchase Telenet Holding shares, to Telenet shares. The exchange ratio will reflect the fair market valuation
of Telenet Holding and Telenet at the time of the exchange. These contractual rights can be exercised within a period
of one month after the exercise of the options and will expire upon the maturity of the 1998 and 1999 plans.

A summary of the activity of the Company's stock options for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 is
as follows:

1999......................... 69,332 83 months 24.79 69,332 83 months 24.79

The Company uses the intrinsic value method prescribed by APB Opinion No. 25, _Accounting for Stock_
_Issued to Employees, to account for its stock options. Accordingly, the excess of the grant date fair value of the_
Company's ordinary shares over the exercise price of the stock options is recognized as compensation expense over
the vesting period of the options. In October 2001, all outstanding options were modified to grant the employees a put
option to sell a portion of the shares obtained upon exercise to the principal shareholder of the Company at the time of
the modification. As a result of this modification, the stock option plan has, since October 2001, been accounted for as
a variable plan in accordance with the provisions of APB Opinion No. 25 and EITF Issue No. 00-23, Issues Related to
_the Accounting for Stock Compensation under APB Opinion No. 25 and FASB Interpretation No. 44._
Consequently, the Company measures additional compensation expense at each subsequent balance sheet date for the
changes, either increases or decreases, in the fair value of the shares covered by the grants. Total compensation
expenses of [€1,217, €1,184 and €380 were recorded in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended]
December 31, 2002 and 2001 and for the period from January 1, 2001 to March 30, 2001, respectively.

The following table illustrates the effect on net loss if the Company had applied the fair value recognition
provisions of SFAS No. 123. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the
Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions used for grants in 1998 and 1999 respectively: risk
free interest rates of 4% and 3.75%, expected lives of 4 years, and a dividend yield and volatility of nil.

**_Warrants_**

Deferral Conversion Warrants and Penny Warrants

In connection with the MixtICS Acquisition and the issuance of Deferrals A and B (see Note 7), the Company
has also issued in August 2002 an additional 1.6 million detachable warrants that contingently vest upon the occurrence
of certain future events ("Deferral Conversion Warrants"), namely a failure on the part of the Company to satisfy
certain acquisition-related liabilities in a timely manner. Until the expiration date in August 2007, these warrants give
the holders (the sellers of MixtICS) the right to purchase a number of the Company's ordinary shares between [€50 or]
€33 per share, based on a formula. The number of shares is only known at the exercise date as it is ultimately based on
a formula linked to the share price.

TELENET GROUP HOLDING NV NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS For the
years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001
and for the period from January 1, 2001 to March 30, 2001
(in thousands of Euro, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)

**12.  SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY**

In addition, in conjunction with Deferral B (see Note 7), the Company also issued in August 2002 a total of 6
detachable warrants ("Penny Warrants"), which will vest as follows:

**Warrant** **Vesting date**

Warrant 1.................................................................................................................................. July 1, 2003
Warrant 2.................................................................................................................................. January 1, 2004
Warrant 3.................................................................................................................................. July 1, 2004
Warrant 4.................................................................................................................................. January 1, 2005
Warrant 5.................................................................................................................................. July 1, 2005
Warrant 6.................................................................................................................................. January 1, 2006

Until the expiration date in August 2012, these warrants give the holders the right to purchase a number of the
Company's ordinary shares for [€0.01 per share. If Deferral B has been fully paid on or prior to a certain vesting date]
of a warrant, such warrant will automatically lapse unexercised. The number of shares is only known at each vesting
date as it is ultimately based on the amount of the Deferral B that has not yet been fully paid at that date.

According to these agreements, the counterparties have also granted the Company a call option on the
warrants and the shares issuable upon exercise thereof. This repurchase option mirrors the warrants described above
and expires on the date that the warrants would have normally become exercisable.

The value of the warrants, [€23,691, was recorded at inception as part of the purchase price with the offsetting]
entry recognized in shareholder's equity.

Mezzanine Warrants and GAP Warrants

In conjunction with the mezzanine subordinated bond issuance and the GAP filling bond issuance (see Note 7),
the Company also issued in August 2002 a total of 2.06 million detachable warrants, which vested immediately upon
issuance. Until the expiration date in August 2007, the mezzanine warrants and the GAP warrants give the holders the
right to purchase a number of the Company's ordinary shares at between [€50 or €33 per share and between €50 or €25]
per share, respectively, based on formulas. The number of shares is only known at the exercise date as it is ultimately
based on a formula linked to the share price.

Moreover the mezzanine warrants also give the holder the right to chose between two exercise prices: [€50 or]
€0.01 per share. However, in the event of electing the latter, these warrants would entitle the holder to subscribe only
to a reduced number of shares.

The value of these warrants at inception, [€43,502, was recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount of the]
underlying debt with the offsetting entry recognized in shareholder's equity.

Bank Warrants

In conjunction with the [€1,250,000 bank facility obtained in July] 2002 (see Note 7), the Company issued in
August 2002 a total of 100,000 detachable warrants, which vested immediately upon issuance. Until the expiration date
in August 2007, these warrants give the holders the right to purchase a number of the Company's ordinary shares for
€0.01 per share. The number of shares is only known at the exercise date as it is ultimately based on the number of
outstanding shares at that August 9, 2002 adjusted by various factors, including additions for shares issued upon the
exercise of other warrants.

263


-----

The value of these warrants at inception, [€46,290, was recorded as a reduction of the carrying amount of the]
underlying debt with the offsetting entry recognized in shareholder's equity.

Price Protection Warrants

In connection with the MixtICS Acquisition, the Company also issued an additional 240 detachable warrants
that contingently vest upon the occurrence of certain future events (see Note 7), namely upon the sale of ordinary
shares below a stated price. These warrants entitle the holder to have so-called full ratchet anti-dilution protection with
respect to a total of 4,840,000 ordinary shares at a price between [€50 and €25 per share in the event of a capital]
increase in cash by the Company consummated during the period starting as of (but not including) August 9, 2002 (the
issuance date) and ending on (and including) June 30, 2003.

Until the expiration date on January 31, 2003, these warrants give the holders (sellers of MixtICS) the right to
purchase a number of the Company's ordinary shares for [€0.01 per share if the event described above occurred. The]
number of shares is only known at the exercise date as it is ultimately based on a formula linked to the share price.

Callahan Warrants

In connection with the Telenet Holding Acquisition, the Company granted detachable warrants to CAI Belgium
to purchase 7,088,001 ordinary shares at an exercise price of [€100 per share. The warrants were to expire no later]
than 2011, and on an accelerated basis if the Vendor Notes due to the Company's former shareholders were not repaid
within five years of issuance. In connection with the MixtICS Acquisition, all of these warrants were cancelled in
August of 2002. The value of the warrants was included in contributed capital.

**_Other Comprehensive Income_**

The Company's comprehensive income equals the net loss for the period, as it has no other comprehensive
income component.

The long-term portion of unearned revenue is included in the Other Liabilities line of the Condensed
Consolidated Balance Sheet. Unearned revenues are generally fees prepaid by the customers and, as discussed in
Note 2, are recognized in the statement of operations on a straight-line basis over the related service period.

**14.  OTHER LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**

**_Service and Transfer Agreement with Electrabel_**

As part of the MitxICS Acquisition in August 2002, the Company also entered into a service and transfer
agreement with Electrabel. Pursuant to this agreement, Electrabel agreed to provide certain operational services (such
as installation, maintenance and call centre services) to the Company from August 9, 2002 through the later of
(i) February 9, 2004 and (ii) the date on which the purchase price (see Note 3), including the deferrals (see Note 7),
has been fully paid.

Upon expiration of the above service agreement, the Company agreed to employ Electrabel's personnel (other
than the call centre services) that were directly involved in providing the services previously rendered by Electrabel
pursuant to this agreement. It has also been agreed by both parties that the number of employees to be transferred is
limited to a maximum of approximately 500 Electrabel personnel. The Company will at a minimum employ each of the
transferred employees on the same terms and conditions as were applicable to them immediately prior to the transfer
date. The agreement with Electrabel states that the Company will not be responsible for any liabilities, claims or
demands related to the periods prior to the date of transfer, including pension rights not fully funded, bonus, holiday
benefits and social security contributions. However, the parties to the agreement have not yet agreed on the method to
compute the liabilities that will be transferred. As the Company can not estimate the potential liability that may result
from the transfer of the personnel, no amounts have been allocated to this contingency in the MixtICS purchase price
allocation.

**_Copyright Litigation_**

In 1993, the Belgian Radio and Television Distributors association (Beroepsvereniging voor Radio- en
Televisiedistributie) (the "RTD"), on behalf of the Belgian cable television operators, signed a contract with the public
broadcasters and the copyright collection agencies in Belgium that determined the copyright fees due by the cable
operators. In September 1995, the Belgian Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers ("SABAM"), a copyright
collection agency, terminated its contract, effective January 1, 1996, and claimed an increase of copyright fees.
SABAM's actions were soon copied by other copyright agencies and broadcasters, mainly the Association of
International Collective Management of Audiovisual Works (Association de Gestion Internationale Collective des
Oeuvres Audiovisuelles, "AGICOA"), being the copyright collection agency for the film studios, and the group of
Foreign Public Broadcasters. This has resulted in extensive litigations.

The disputes with AGICOA and SABAM have been settled in November 2002 and May 2003, respectively.
Under such settlement agreements, the Company agreed to pay [€20.5] million for additional past copyright fees and a
copyright for going forward, which is calculated based on the numbers of subscribers and, in the case of AGICOA, a
per program price. These settlements have been included in the financial statements.

265


-----

In February 2003, with respect to the suit with the Foreign Public Broadcasters, the Commercial Court in
Brussels ruled that for the period from 1996 through 2001 the Foreign Public Broadcasters are entitled to approximately
€47.7 million, for which we have joint and several liability. The Company's additional liability subsequent to this ruling is
estimated to be [€21.6] million for the period from 1996 through 2001 (provided that the other members of RTD pay their
proportionate share), together with interest since June 1, 2002 at a current rate of 7% per year, with an additional
€3.8 million due for fiscal year 2002. RTD has appealed the court's decision.

The Company has come to an agreement with a Flemish Broadcaster on past and future copyright payments.
The Company has also been in litigation with smaller copyright collection agencies and broadcasters.

The Company has accrued [€46,250 in other liabilities for the amounts that the Company expects to pay as a]
result of the above settlements and these accruals were adjusted against the goodwill recognized as part of the
MixtICS Acquisition.

**_Interconnection Litigation_**

The Company has been involved in legal proceedings with Belgacom related to the increased interconnection
fees that have been charged since August 2002 to telephone operators to terminate calls made to end users on the
Company's network.

Traditionally, interconnection fees for fixed line telephony have been charged on a reciprocal basis, meaning
that Belgacom and Telenet charged to each other the same interconnection termination rates. The Company's unit
costs however, as a result of lower benefits of scale and recent investments, are higher compared to Belgacom's. As a
result of this different cost structure and because of a continued higher level of fees charged by Belgacom regarding
the fixed-to-mobile interconnection, Telenet requested the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and
Telecommunications (BIPT) to approve an increase of its domestic and international interconnection rates, which was
obtained in June 2002. In August 2002 the BIPT amended its decision by ruling that the increase would not apply to
inbound international calls. As a result the Company upwardly adjusted its interconnection termination rates for inbound
domestic calls effective August 2002. Belgacom has increased the tariffs charged to its telephony customers calling
Telenet numbers to reflect our increased termination rates.

Belgacom challenged the Company's increased interconnection termination rates before the Commercial Court
of Mechelen (Rechtbank van Koophandel) alleging abusive pricing. The Commercial Court heard arguments in the
case in September 2003, and a ruling is expected during the fourth quarter of 2003. The court may defer to the price
determination made by the BIPT as the primary regulator of the telecommunications industry in Belgium, in which case
we would be able to continue to charge our current interconnection termination rates. Alternatively, the court may
decide to review the merits of the termination rate increase, in which case it may affirm the termination rate increase,
determine that the termination rate is abnormally high and require that it be reduced or, less likely, decide that the old
tariff be reinstated. Belgacom has further challenged the BIPT's June 2002 approval of Telenet's increased domestic
interconnection termination rates before the Council of State (Raad van State), the highest administrative court in
Belgium. The council may affirm the BIPT's decision or return the case to the BIPT for reconsideration. The Council
of State rejected an emergency request from Belgacom to suspend the implementation of the increased interconnection
termination rate.

A decision reducing the interconnection termination rates that we can charge could have a material adverse
effect on our telephony business.

The Company does not think it is likely that either the commercial court or the BIPT would require Telenet to
repay amounts that have been received under the higher interconnection termination rates prior to any ruling requiring a
reduction of the rates because of the difficulty that Belgacom would have in demonstrating that it suffered any harm as
it was able to pass the higher interconnection termination rates through to its customers in the form of a higher tariff
structure.

**15.  RELATED PARTIES**

**_Related Party Identification_**

266


-----

The related parties of the Company mainly comprise its shareholders that own more than 10% of the voting
rights of the Company, namely GIMV, the MICs and PICs and Cable Partners Europe L.L.C. ("CPE") (formerly
known as Callahan Associates International L.L.C.).

**_Related Party Transactions_**

The transactions with Interkabel and the PICs mainly relate to the clientele fee and the annuity fee charged by
the PICs. Before the MixtICS Acquisition, transactions with the MICs pertained to the clientele fee. In addition, the
Company owned approximately 60% of the MICs HFC Upgrade. The MICs acted as an agent for the Company and
recharged approximately 60% of related HFC Upgrade capital expenditure to the Company.

Transactions with CPE include payment of transaction expenses related to the acquisitions of Telenet Holding
and MixtICS. In addition, Telenet Operaties and CPE entered into a Strategic Services Agreement dated March 31,
2001 (the "Management Agreement"). Under the Management Agreement, CPE provides strategic advice and assists
with the expansion, development and growth of the Company.

Transaction costs related to the Telenet Holding Acquisition included payments to CPE ([€32,447), Financial]
Consortium ([€1,127), GIMV (€1,127), Interkabel (€685), and Electrabel (€1,722), all related parties. Transaction costs]
related to MixtICS Acquisition included payments to CPE ([€1,497) and MICs (€3,440).]

**16.  FAIR MARKET VALUE**

The carrying amounts and related estimated fair values of the Company's significant financial instruments were
as follows:

**December 31, 2002** **December 31, 2001**


**Carrying**
**Amount** **Fair Value**


**Carrying**
**Amount** **Fair Value**


Long-term debt (including short-term maturities) (1,354,628) (1,354,628) (1,528,502) (1,528,502)
Interest rate swaps................................................ (12,137) (12,137) (3,898) (3,898)

Total.................................................................. (1,371,891) (1,371,891) (1,532,322) (1,532,322)

The fair value of derivative financial instruments are determined by commercial banks and reviewed internally.

The fair values of long-term debt are estimated at the lesser of either the call price or the market value as
determined by quoted market prices, where available, or, where not available, at the present value of future cash flows
discounted at rates consistent with comparable maturities with similar credit risk. As of December 31, 2001 and
December 31, 2002 the carrying value of long-term debt approximated the fair value.

The carrying amounts for financial assets classified as current assets and the carrying amounts for financial
liabilities classified as current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments.

The fair values of other financial instruments for which carrying amounts and fair values have not been
presented are not materially different than their related carrying amounts.

Some judgment had been used in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the
estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize in a current
market exchange.

**17.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

**_Amendments to the Senior Credit Facility_**

In April 2003, the 2002 Facility obtained in July 2002 (see Note 7) was amended. Among other modifications,
these amendments reduced the total credit facility to [€1,185,000 (Tranche B was reduced from €125,000 to €50,000]
and Tranche D was increased from [€50,000 to € 60,000) and increased the interest margins as follows:]

Tranche A........................................................................................................................ from 3.25% to 3.50%
Tranche B ........................................................................................................................ from 3.25% to 3.50%
Tranche C1....................................................................................................................... from 2.625% to 3.50%
Tranche C2....................................................................................................................... from 4.00% to 4.25%

269


-----

Tranche D........................................................................................................................ from 3.25% to 3.50%

Also, commitment fees were increased from 0.75% to 1.25%.

Moreover, the financial covenants were also modified to extend the periods covered by the quarterly
assessments (generally an additional year) and various ratios and measures were revised accordingly.

Finally, upon the modification of the original facility, 21,385 Bank Warrants (see Note 12) were cancelled.

**_Amounts Repaid and Drawn from the 2002 Facility_**

During the period from April 2003 to October 2003, the Company has drawn down and repaid various amounts
resulting in a total outstanding balance for the 2002 Facility of [€975,000.]

**_Gap Filling Bonds_**

The bonds have not been repaid on the stated maturity date, namely October 31, 2003. As a result, the stated
maturity date is gradually extended until such time as the full amount of debt has been repaid, not to extend beyond
July 31, 2006.

**_Penny Warrants: Vesting Dates Modification_**

In connection with the MixtICS Acquisition and Deferral A and B, the Company issued 6 detachable warrants
("Penny Warrants") that vest consecutively every 6 months from July 1, 2003 through January 1, 2006. In
September 2003, the parties agreed to modify the vesting dates for warrants 1 and 2 as follows:

**Warrant** **OLD Vesting date** **NEW Vesting date**

Warrant 1............................................................................................... July 1, 2003 December 1, 2003
Warrant 2............................................................................................... January 1, 2004 December 1, 2003

**_Canal+ Acquisition_**

The Company have entered into agreement to acquire all of the Flemish assets and subscribers of the Canal+
group (the "Canal+ Acquisition"), which will allow the Company to offer the premium television services currently
provided by the Canal+ group directly to the Company's cable television subscribers as well as those of the PICs. The
Belgian competition authority (Raad voor de Mededinging) has approved the acquisition, subject to certain conditions.
These conditions require the Company, among other things, to:

       - grant other premium television service providers access to the Company's network on commercially
reasonable terms, taking into account, among other things, the available capacity on the Company's
network;

       - offer the Canal+ premium service to other television network operators who want access to its
content, and charge end users on the Company's network and such other networks a uniform,
nondiscriminatory price for all end users;

       - not enter into contracts with broadcasters that make the Company the exclusive distributor of their
signal and waive any exclusivity provisions that are currently in force within 30 days of the authority's
decision;

       - not invoice Canal+ subscribers served by other service providers under the "Telenet" name and not
deliver any Telenet publicity with such invoices; the Company must list all service providers that
provide Canal+ in any Telenet advertising for Canal+; and

270


-----

      - provide the Belgian competition authority an annual compliance report and obtain approval of the
competition authority for any sale or assignment of the content rights that the Company acquire from
Canal+.

The decision of the Belgian competition authority is subject to appeal within 30 days from publication of the
decision in the Belgian Official Gazette. The Company's acquisition of the Canal+ Assets is also subject to a number of
conditions to closing, including the sale to other parties of the Canal+ business in the French-speaking part of Belgium
and the consent of the movie studios and other programming suppliers that provide content to Canal+. The acquisition is
expected to close in December 2003.

**_Codenet Acquisition_**

The Company has entered into an agreement to acquire Codenet, a broadband Internet, data and voice
provider operating primarily in the business market throughout Belgium. The completion of this acquisition is subject to
certain conditions, including approval by the Belgian competition authorities (which was obtained on November 28,
2003). Upon completion, this acquisition will expand the Company's backbone network, across all of Belgium and parts
of Luxembourg, allowing the Company to directly provide business services throughout Belgium. The acquisition is
expected to close in December 2003.

In connection with the Canal+ Acquisition and the pending acquisition of Codenet, the Company has agreed to
pay combined purchase prices of approximately [€45] million in cash, including transaction expenses, and anticipates that
the acquired businesses will have a negative cash impact in the short term.

**_Employee Stock Options Exercised_**

As discussed in Note 11, the Company granted stock options to its employees. In 2003, 38,450 options have
been exercised. Consequently, new shares of Telenet Holding were issued to the former holders of those options.
These shares were then exchanged for Telenet shares.

**_Goodwill_**

In connection with SFAS No. 142, _Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS No. 142"), the Company_
performed its annual review for impairment during the third quarter of 2003. The earnings forecast for the Company
was revised in 2003 mainly to reflect the Company's assessment of changes in the Belgian markets for the telephony
and internet services. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment of [€336,000 in the third quarter of 2003. The]
tax impact recorded on this impairment is nil as a full valuation allowance is applied against all net deferred tax assets.

**_High Yield Bond Offering_**

HoldCo intends to offer [€400,000 of 10] year Senior Notes. The Company intends to use most of the proceeds
to reduce existing indebtedness under its senior credit facility and deferrals.

TELENET GROUP HOLDING NV NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL
STATEMENTS For the nine months ended September 30, 2003 and 2002
and balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2002
(in thousands of Euro, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)

**1.  ORGANIZATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

The accompanying consolidated financial statements present the operations of Telenet Group Holding NV
("Telenet") and its subsidiaries (hereafter collectively referred to as the "Company"). Through its broadband network in
Flanders, the Company offers cable television, broadband Internet and telephony services, primarily to residential
subscribers.

The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements are unaudited. In the opinion of
management, these unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements include all adjustments which are
necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods. The
interim condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated
financial statements as of December 31, 2002 and 2001. Results for the nine months ended September 30, 2003 are not
necessarily indicative of future results.

**2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally
Accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The Company's functional and reporting currency is euro
("[€"), which is also the functional currency of each of the Company's subsidiaries. The interim financial statements are]
based on the accounting principles and practices applied in the preparation of the financial statements for the last fiscal
year except as indicated below.

**_Management's Use of Estimates_**

The presentation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

**_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_**

In May 2003 the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 150, Accounting for Certain
_Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity ("SFAS No. 150"). SFAS No. 150_
establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures in its statement of financial position certain financial
instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity. In accordance with SFAS No. 150, certain financial
instruments that embody obligations for the issuer are required to be classified as liabilities. SFAS No. 150 is effective
for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the
first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company adopted SFAS No. 150 on July 1, 2003 and it had no
material impact on its results of operations and financial position.

**5.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS No. 142"),
the Company completed a transitional impairment test of its goodwill in 2002 and performed its annual review for
impairment during the third quarter of 2003. Goodwill was computed based on one reporting unit.

Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flows using reasonable and appropriate assumptions that
are consistent with internal forecasts. Upon implementation of SFAS No. 142, the Company determined that goodwill
was impaired and recorded the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle by an impairment of [€667,628]
for the year ended December 31, 2002. The earnings forecast for the Company was revised in 2003 mainly to reflect
the Company's assessment of changes in the Belgian markets for the telephony and Internet services. As a result, the
Company recognized an impairment of [€336,000 in the third quarter of 2003 as a component of amortization of]
intangible assets in the accompanying statement of operations. The tax impact recorded on these impairments is nil as a
full valuation allowance is applied against all net deferred tax assets.

Summarized below are the carrying value and accumulated amortization of intangible assets that will continue
to be amortized under SFAS No. 142, as well as the carrying amount of goodwill, which is not amortized.

**11.  OTHER LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**

**_Service and Transfer Agreement with Electrabel_**

As part of the MitxICS Acquisition in August 2002, the Company also entered into a service and transfer
agreement with Electrabel. Pursuant to this agreement, Electrabel agreed to provide certain operational services (such
as installation, maintenance and call centre services) to the Company from August 9, 2002 through the later of
(i) February 9, 2004 and (ii) the date on which the purchase price, including the deferrals, has been fully paid.

Upon expiration of the above agreement, the Company agreed to employ Electrabel's personnel (other than the
call centre services) that were directly involved in providing the services previously rendered by Electrabel pursuant to
this agreement. It has also been agreed by both parties that the number of employees to be transferred is limited to a
maximum of approximately 500. The Company will at a minimum employ each of the transferred employees on the
same terms and conditions as were applicable to them immediately prior to the transfer date. The agreement with
Electrabel states that the Company will not be responsible for any liabilities, claims or demands related to the periods
prior to the date of transfer, including pension rights not fully funded, bonuses, holiday benefits and social security
contributions. However, the parties to the agreement have not yet agreed on the method to compute the liabilities that
will be transferred. As the Company cannot estimate the potential liability that may result from the transfer of the
personnel, no amounts have been allocated to this contingency in the MixtICS purchase price allocation, and no liability
has been accounted for as of September 30, 2003.

**_Copyright Litigation_**

In 1993, the Belgian Radio and Television Distributors association (Beroepsvereniging voor Radio- en
Televisiedistributie) (the "RTD"), on behalf of the Belgian cable television operators, signed a contract with the public
broadcasters and the copyright collection agencies in Belgium that determined the copyright fees due by the cable
operators. In September 1995, the Belgian Society of Authors, Composers and Publishers ("SABAM"), a copyright
collection agency, terminated its contract, effective January 1, 1996, and claimed an increase of copyright fees. The
key argument concerns the basis of the copyright charges, namely the actual, as initially negotiated through RTD, vs.
the potential viewers. SABAM's actions were soon copied by other copyright agencies and broadcasters, the most
important of which were the Association of International Collective Management of Audiovisual Works (Association
de Gestion Internationale Collective des Oeuvres Audiovisuelles, "AGICOA"), being the copyright collection agency for
the film studios, and the group of Foreign Public Broadcasters.

285


-----

The disputes with AGICOA and SABAM were settled in November 2002 and May 2003, respectively. Under
such settlement agreements, the Company agreed to pay [€20.5] million for additional past copyright fees and a copyright
fee for going forward, which is calculated based on the numbers of subscribers and, in the case of AGICOA, a per
program price. These settlements have been included in the financial statements.

In February 2003, with respect to the suit by the Foreign Public Broadcasters, the Commercial Court in
Brussels ruled that for the period from 1996 through 2001 the Foreign Public Broadcasters are entitled to approximately
€47.7 million, for which we have joint and several liability. The Company's additional liability subsequent to this ruling is
estimated to be approximate [€21.6] million for the period from 1996 through 2001 (provided that the other members of
RTD pay their proportional share), together with interest since June 1, 2002 at a current rate of 7% per year and with
an additional [€3.8 million due for the fiscal year 2002. RTD has appealed the court's decision.]

The Company has come to an agreement with a Flemish Broadcaster on past and future copyright payments.
We have also been in litigation with smaller copyright collection agencies and broadcasters.

The Company has accrued [€43,310 in other liabilities as of September] 30, 2003 for the amounts that the
Company expects to pay as a result of the above settlements and outstanding litigations. These accruals were adjusted
against the goodwill recognized as part of the MixtICS Acquisition.

**_Interconnection Litigation_**

The Company has been involved in legal proceedings with Belgacom related to the increased interconnection
fees that have been charged since August 2002 to telephone operators to terminate calls made to end users on the
Company's network.

Traditionally, interconnection fees for fixed line telephony have been charged on a reciprocal basis, meaning
that Belgacom and Telenet charged to each other the same interconnection termination rates. The Company's unit
costs however, as a result of lower benefits of scale, are higher compared to Belgacom's. As a result of this different
cost structure and because of a continued higher level of fees charged by Belgacom regarding the fixed-to-mobile
interconnection, Telenet requested the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications (BIPT) approval
to increase its domestic and international interconnection rates, which was obtained in June 2002. In August 2002 the
BIPT amended its decision by ruling that the increase would not apply to inbound international calls. As a result the
Company increased its interconnection termination rates for inbound domestic calls effective August 2002. Belgacom
has increased the tariffs charged to its telephony customers calling Telenet numbers to reflect the Company's
increased interconnection termination rates.

Belgacom challenged the Company's increased interconnection termination rates before the Commercial Court
of Mechelen (Rechtbank van Koophandel) alleging abusive pricing. The Commercial Court heard arguments in the
case in September 2003, and a ruling is expected during the fourth quarter of 2003. The court may defer to the price
determination made by the BIPT as the primary regulator of the telecommunications industry in Belgium, in which case
we would be able to continue to charge our current interconnection termination rates. Alternatively, the court may
decide to review the merits of the termination rate increase, in which case it may affirm the termination rate increase,
determinate that the termination rate is abnormally high and require that it be reduced or, less likely, decide that the old
tariff be reinstated. Belgacom has further challenged the BIPT's June 2002 approval of Telenet's increased domestic
interconnection termination rates before the Council of State (Raad van State), the highest administrative court in
Belgium. The council may affirm the BIPT's decision or return the case to the BIPT for reconsideration. The Council
of State rejected an emergency request from Belgacom to suspend the implementation of the increased interconnection
termination rates.

A decision reducing the interconnection termination rates that we can charge could have a material adverse
effect on our telephony business.

The Company does not think it is likely that either the commercial court or the BIPT would require Telenet to
repay amounts that have been received under the higher interconnection termination rates prior to any ruling requiring a
reduction of the rates because of the difficulty that Belgacom would have in demonstrating that it suffered any harm as
it was able to pass the higher interconnection termination rates through to its customers in the form of a higher tariff
structure.

**12.  SUBSEQUENT EVENTS**

**_Gap Filling Bonds_**

The bonds have not been repaid on the stated maturity date, namely October 31, 2003. As a result, the stated
maturity date is gradually extended until such time the full amount of debt has been repaid, not to extend beyond
July 31, 2006.

**_Canal+ Acquisition_**

The Company has entered into agreement to acquire all of the Flemish assets and subscribers of the Canal+
group (the "Canal+ Acquisition"), which will allow the Company to offer the premium television services currently
provided by the Canal+ group directly to the Company's cable television subscribers as well as those of the PICs. The
Belgian competition authority (Raad voor de Mededinging) has approved the acquisition, subject to certain conditions.
These conditions require the Company, among other things, to:

      - grant other premium television service providers access to the Company's network on commercially
reasonable terms, taking into account, among other things, the available capacity on the Company's
network;

      - offer the Canal+ premium service to other television network operators who want access to its
content, and charge end users on the Company's network and such other networks a uniform,
nondiscriminatory price for all end users;

      - not enter into contracts with broadcasters that make the Company the exclusive distributor of their
signal and waive any exclusivity provisions that are currently in force within 30 days of the authority's
decision;

      - not invoice Canal+ subscribers served by other service providers under the "Telenet" name and not
deliver any Telenet publicity with such invoices; the Company must list all service providers who
provide Canal+ in any Telenet advertising for Canal+; and

      - provide the Belgian competition authority an annual compliance report and obtain approval of the
competition authority for any sale or assignment of the content rights that the Company acquire from
Canal+.

The decision of the Belgian competition authority is subject to appeal within a month from publication in the
Belgian Official Gazette (Belgisch Staatsblad). The Company's acquisition of the Canal+ Assets is also subject to a
number of conditions to closing, including the sale to other parties of the Canal+ business in the French-speaking region
of Belgium and the consent of the movie studios and other programming suppliers that provide content to Canal+. The
acquisition is expected to close in December 2003.

**_Codenet Acquisition_**

On December 9, 2003 the Company acquired Codenet, a broadband Internet, data and voice provider operating
primarily in the business market throughout Belgium. The completion of this acquisition was approved by the Belgian
competition authorities on November 28, 2003. This acquisition expands the Company's backbone network across all of
Belgium and parts of Luxembourg, allowing the Company to directly provide business services throughout Belgium.

In connection with the Canal+ Acquisition and our recent acquisition of Codenet, the Company has agreed to
pay combined purchase prices of approximately [€45] million in cash, including transaction expenses, and anticipates that
the acquisitions will have a negative cash impact in the short term.

**_Stock Options Exercised_**

The Company granted stock options to its employees. In 2003, 38,450 options have been exercised.

287


-----

Consequently, new shares of Telenet Holding were issued to the former holders of those options. These shares were
then exchanged for Telenet shares.

**_High Yield Bond Offering_**

Telenet Communications NV intends to offer [€500,000 of 10] year Senior Notes. The Company intends to use
most of the proceeds to reduce existing indebtedness under its senior credit facility and deferrals.

**_Senior Discount Notes Offering_**

Telenet Group Holding NV intends to offer approximately [€258,200 of Senior Discount Notes, the net cash]
proceeds of which will be used to repay all remaining deferred payment obligations and subordinated shareholder loans.

**ANNEX A**
**SUMMARY OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN**
**BELGIAN GAAP AND U.S. GAAP**

Our compliance with the financial covenants contained in the senior credit facility, set out in Annex B, is
measured by reference to financial statements that we prepare for Belgian legal and statutory purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles in Belgium ("Belgian GAAP").

Belgian GAAP differ from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America
("U.S. GAAP"), under which our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated
financial statements are prepared.

The differences may be material to the financial information included in this offering memorandum. In making
an investment decision, investors must rely upon their own examination of us, the terms of the offering and the financial
information included in this offering memorandum. Potential investors should consult their own professional advisors for
an understanding of the differences between Belgian GAAP and U.S. GAAP and how those differences might affect
the financial information included in this offering memorandum.

Certain significant differences between Belgian and U.S. GAAP relevant to our financial statements are
summarized below. However, this summary does not purport to provide a comprehensive analysis, including
quantification, of such differences but rather is a listing of potential differences in accounting principles related to our
financial statements. We have not quantified these differences, nor undertaken a reconciliation of our financial
statements prepared under Belgian GAAP to U.S. GAAP. Had we undertaken any such quantification or
reconciliation, other potentially significant accounting and disclosure differences may have come to our attention which
are not identified below. Accordingly, we can provide no assurance that the identified differences in the summary
below represent all the principal differences relating to our financial statements. In addition, no attempt has been made
to identify future differences between Belgian GAAP and U.S. GAAP resulting from prescribed changes in accounting
standards.

Regulatory bodies that promulgate Belgian GAAP and U.S. GAAP have significant on-going projects that
could affect a future comparison such as this. No attempt has been made to identify all future differences between
Belgian GAAP and U.S. GAAP that may affect our financial statements as a result of transactions or events that may
occur in the future.

_Fixed Asset Depreciation_

Prior to 2002, under Belgian GAAP, the Company depreciated its assets for a full twelve months in the year of
acquisition. Under U.S. GAAP, depreciation is charged from the moment the assets are ready for their intended use.
In 2002, the Company changed its accounting for fixed asset depreciation under Belgian GAAP to be the same as
U.S. GAAP.

_Revenue Recognition_

Under U.S. GAAP, the Company accounts for the revenue, costs and expenses related to cable television,
Internet and telephony services as the related services are performed in accordance with SFAS No. 51, _Financial_
_Reporting by Cable Television Companies ("SFAS No. 51")._

Installation revenue for cable television, Internet and telephony services is recognized to the extent of direct
selling costs incurred. The remainder is deferred and amortized over the estimated average period that subscribers are
expected to remain connected to the system.

In compliance with SFAS No. 51, the Company capitalizes the initial subscriber installation costs. These
installation costs are depreciated over a period no longer than the period used for the network. Installation costs relating
to the Company's Internet and telephony business are depreciated over a period of five years. Installation costs relating
to the cable television are depreciated over 20 years, which is in line with the depreciation of the cable television plant.

Under Belgian GAAP, only the excess of installation costs for Internet and telephony over installation revenue

289


-----

is capitalized and amortized over an average customer life of five years.

_Capital Leases_

The Company has entered into various lease transactions including the sale-leaseback of two buildings.

Under Belgian GAAP, the Company recorded the sale-lease back of the buildings as an operating lease.
Under the terms of the sale-leaseback agreement, the Company has maintained involvement with one building through
ownership of the land and has a bargain purchase option related to the second building. Consequently, these
transactions are accounted for as finance leases under U.S. GAAP.

_Deferred Taxes_

In view of the Company's history of losses, all net deferred tax assets have been subject to a valuation
allowance under U.S. GAAP. Deferred taxes are not accounted for under Belgian GAAP.

_Stock Based Compensation_

Under Belgian GAAP, the Company does not record any compensation expense with respect to the options
granted to employees.

The Company accounts for its employee stock option plans in accordance with the provisions of Accounting
Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"), _Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. As such, the Company_
recognizes deferred compensation expense for the difference between the fair value of the related shares and the
exercise price of the options on the measurement date. All deferred compensation expense is amortized over the threeyear vesting period of the options.

_Financial Instruments_

Under Belgian GAAP, the fair value of financial instruments is not recorded within the financial statements at
inception or subsequent balance sheet dates. Gains and losses on financial instruments are only recognized upon
settlement of the related contract.

Under U.S. GAAP, in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133
("SFAS 133"), _Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities and its related interpretations and_
amendments, all financial instruments are recorded at their fair value on the balance sheet subsequent to the 2001
acquisition, the Company has determined that the financial instruments outstanding do not qualify for hedge accounting
in accordance with the terms of SFAS 133, and therefore all subsequent changes in the fair value of these instruments
are recognized through the Company's income statement.

_Cost of Capital Increases_

Under Belgian GAAP, costs of capital increases are capitalized and amortized over four years on a straightline basis. Under U.S. GAAP, such costs are deducted from contributed capital.

_Goodwill_

Under Belgian GAAP, the Company allocates the actual purchase consideration paid in a business combination
to the net assets that were acquired. Any purchase consideration in excess of the net assets is recognized as goodwill
within the financial statements and amortized over five years. All costs related to the transaction are expensed as
incurred.

Under U.S. GAAP, the actual purchase consideration plus related deal expenses are allocated to the net assets
acquired, as required under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 ("SFAS 141"), _Business_
_Combinations ("SFAS 142"),_ _Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. All consideration in excess of the net assets_
acquired is recognized as goodwill and was amortized over a period of 15 years until the year ended December 31,
2001.

290


-----

Under U.S. GAAP, goodwill is no longer amortized and is subject to an annual impairment test, as required
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142 ("SFAS 142"), Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.

_Capitalization and Amortization of Debt Issuance Costs_

Under Belgian GAAP, all capitalized debt issuance costs are amortized on a straight-line basis. Under
U.S. GAAP, all capitalized debt issuance costs are amortized based on the effective interest method.

_Gain on Extinguishment of Vendor Notes_

Under Belgian GAAP, the Company has recognized the gain on extinguishment of the Vendor Notes as
extraordinary income. Under U.S. GAAP, the extinguishment of the Vendor Notes was accounted for as a capital
transaction as this was a transaction with a related party.

_Allocation of Warrant Value to Debt_

Under Belgian GAAP, warrants are accounted for when exercised. Under U.S. GAAP warrants are
accounted for at the time of issuance. Warrants were valued based on the Black-Scholes model. Warrants issued in
conjunction with the issuance of debt were accounted for in accordance with Accounting Principles Board Opinion
No. 14 ("APB 14"), _Accounting for Convertible Debt and Debt Issued with Stock Purchase Warrants._
Accordingly, the proceeds of the debt issued were allocated to the debt and the warrants based upon the relative fair
value of the warrants and the debt.

_Clientele Agreements and Annuity Agreement_

In 1996, we entered into the Clientele Agreements with the MICs and the PICs and into the Annuity
Agreement. We pay clientele fees under the Clientele Agreements in return for access to the cable network customer
database owned and controlled by the MICs and PICs. The clientele fee is payable as long as we maintain usage rights
to the cable network. Such payments allow the MICs and the PICs to recover part of their historical HFC upgrade
investment.

Considering this, the present value of the clientele fee payments over the first 20 years (being the life of the
longest lived assets that are part of the HFC upgrade) has been accounted for as network user rights under intangible
assets, and is amortized over ten or 20 years depending on the useful life of the underlying assets that make up the
HFC upgrade.

In connection with the MixtICS Acquisition, we acquired full control of the portion of the HFC upgrade
previously owned by the MICs. Consequently, from the MixtICS Acquisition onwards, network user rights only relate
to the access to the cable network of the PICs and the relating balance of the clientele fee payable reflects solely our
outstanding obligation to the PICs.

In accordance with the terms of the Annuity Agreement, the PICs charge us an annuity fee, which in
substance covers the remaining 60% of the cost of the HFC upgrade incurred by the PICs. Payments under the
Annuity Agreement are due over a period of ten or 20 years, depending on the useful life of the underlying assets that
make up the HFC upgrade incurred by the PICs. The present value of the future payments under the Annuity
Agreement has been capitalized as network user rights under intangible assets, and is amortized over ten or 20 years
depending on the useful life of the underlying assets that make up the HFC upgrade.

**ANNEX B**
**SUMMARY OF CERTAIN SENIOR CREDIT FACILITY COVENANTS**

The following Annex sets forth certain financial covenants and certain related definitions in our Senior Credit
Facility. This Annex B is not a complete recitation of the financial covenants in our Senior Credit Facility. While we
have included definitions of financial terms in this summary, certain defined terms from our Senior Credit Facility are
not set forth herein.

Importantly, our compliance with the financial covenants is measured by reference to financial statements that
we prepare for Belgian legal and statutory purposes in accordance with Belgian GAAP. Belgian GAAP differs from
U.S. GAAP, under which our audited consolidated financial statements and unaudited condensed consolidated financial
statements included in this offering memorandum are prepared. The differences may be material to calculations under
the financial covenants. For a summary of certain significant differences between Belgian GAAP and U.S. GAAP,
see Annex A to this offering memorandum.

The financial covenants set forth below assume that the gross proceeds from this offering will equal
€400 million and that the interest rate on the Notes will equal 10%. We and the lenders under the senior credit facility
have agreed that, following the completion of this offering, we will reset the covenant levels to reflect the actual
amount of gross proceeds from this offering and the actual interest rate for the Notes.

**Financial Covenants**

Our financial covenants require, among other things:

      - Maintenance of a minimum amount of Annualized EBITDA for the six months ending on an
Accounting Date ("Minimum Annualized EBITDA")

      - Maintenance of a minimum ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Total Interest Payable at the end of
each Measurement Period ending on an Accounting Date ("Total Debt Interest Cover")

      - Maintenance of a maximum ratio of Net Senior Debt to Annualized EBITDA at the end of each
Measurement Period ending on an Accounting Date ("Net Senior Debt/Annualized EBITDA")

      - Maintenance of a minimum ratio of Annualized EBITDA for the period ending on an Accounting Date
to Estimated Total Debt Service for the period of 12 months commencing on such Accounting Date
("Pro-Forma Debt Service Cover Ratio")

      - Maintenance of a maximum ratio of Net Total Debt to Annualized EBITDA at the end of each
Measurement Period ending on an Accounting Date ("Net Total Debt to EBITDA")

The unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements of Telenet Group Holding as of and for the
quarters ended December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2003 have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

The financial information included in this report is not intended to comply with SEC reporting requirements.
Compliance with such requirements would require the modification or exclusion of certain financial measures, including
EBITDA, EBITDA margin, average revenue per subscriber and our annualized and pro forma data. Except for the
impact of presenting as equity certain detachable warrants issued by Telenet Group Holding, the financial position and
results of operations of Telenet Group Holding are substantially similar to the financial position and operations of

to the applicable GAAP measures.

**Subscriber Data**

Each subscriber is counted as a revenue generating unit, or "RGU," for each service subscribed, regardless of
the number of services that customer receives from us. Thus, a subscriber who receives from us basic cable television,
broadband Internet and telephony services (regardless of their number of telephony access lines) would be counted as
three RGUs. The subscriber data included herein, including penetration rates, average revenue per subscriber, market
shares and churn rates, are derived from management estimates, are not part of our financial statements and have not
been audited or otherwise reviewed by an outside auditor, consultant or expert.

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
As of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
(in thousands of Euro, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)

**1.  BASIS OF PRESENTATION**

The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements present the operations of Telenet
Group Holding NV ("Telenet") and its subsidiaries (hereafter collectively referred to as the "Company"). Through its
broadband network, the Company offers cable television, including premium television services, broadband Internet and
telephony services to residential subscribers in Flanders as well as broadband Internet, data and voice services in the
business market throughout Belgium. Telenet and its principal subsidiaries are limited liability companies organized
under Belgian law.

The accompanying condensed consolidated interim financial statements are unaudited (the “Interim Financial
Statements”). In the opinion of management, these Interim Financial Statements include all adjustments which are
necessary to present fairly the financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods. The Interim
Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements as of
December 31, 2002 and 2001. Results for the three months ended December 31, 2003 are not necessarily indicative of
future results.

**2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES**

The Interim Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with Accounting Principles Generally
Accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The Company's functional and reporting currency is Euros
("[€"), which is also the functional currency of each of the Company's subsidiaries.]

**_Management's Use of Estimates_**

The presentation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of the contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

**_Financial Instruments_**

The Company accounts for its derivative instruments in accordance with the provisions of Statement of
Financial Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 133, _Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities_
("SFAS No. 133") and related interpretations and amendments. SFAS No. 133 requires the recognition of derivatives
as assets or liabilities on a company's balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value. Changes
in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in earnings, unless (i) the normal purchase or sale exception or (ii) hedge,
other than fair value hedges, accounting is elected.

Upon issuing the USD-denominated Senior Discount Notes, the Company entered into foreign exchange
forward contracts to hedge the variability of the Euro-equivalent cash flows related to the fully accreted amount of the
Senior Discount Notes (i.e. USD 558 million) as of the first redemption date December 15, 2008. These foreign
exchange forward contracts are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value, which is the estimated amount at
which they could be settled based on forward market exchange rates, and all contracts mature as of December 15,
2008. On the date the contracts were entered into, they were designated as a foreign currency cash flow hedge.
Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contracts that are highly effective and qualify as a foreign currency cash
flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income. The Senior Discount Notes are periodically re-measured at
spot exchange rates and the resulting foreign exchange gain or loss will offset with a corresponding amount of gain or
loss on the foreign exchange forward contracts that will be reclassified periodically from other comprehensive income
to earnings.

The Company has formally documented the above hedge relationship between the Senior Discount Notes (the
hedged item) and the foreign exchange forward contracts (the hedging instruments), as well as its risk management

NOTES TO THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)
As of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
(in thousands of Euro, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)

objective and strategy for undertaking such hedge transactions. The Company formally assesses, both at the hedge’s
inception and on an ongoing basis, whether the foreign exchange forward contracts that are used are highly effective in
offsetting changes in cash flows of the hedged item. When it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a
hedge or that it has ceased to be a highly effective hedge, the Company discontinues hedge accounting prospectively.

The Company has determined that all other outstanding derivative instruments do not qualify for normal
purchase and sale exception or hedge accounting; therefore all changes in the fair value of these instruments are
recognized as a gain or loss within the statement of operations.

Moreover, SFAS No. 133 also requires certain embedded derivatives to be separated from the host contracts
and recorded as either an asset or a liability on a company's balance sheet, measured at fair value. Specifically, if the
economic characteristics of an embedded derivative instrument and its host contract are not clearly and closely related,
SFAS No. 133 requires that the embedded derivative instrument be separated (bifurcated) and accounted for as a
stand-alone derivative instrument. The Company has determined that it has no embedded derivative instruments that
are required to be bifurcated and measured at fair value.

**_Deferred Finance Costs_**

Costs associated with the refinancing and issuance of debt as well as debt discounts, if any, are deferred and
expensed as interest over the term of the related debt agreement using the effective interest rate method. As a result
of the December 2003 amendment of the Senior Credit Facility which resulted in a partial extinguishment as defined by
Accounting Principles Board ("APB") Opinion No. 26, _Early Extinguishment of Debt ("APB 26") and a significant_
modification as defined by Emerging Issues Task Force ("EITF") Issue No. 96-19, _Debtor’s Accounting for a_
_Modification or Exchange of Debt Instruments ("EITF 96-19"), the Company expensed approximately_ [€18,600 of]
unamortized debt issuance costs. Accordingly, the unamortized debt discount on the Senior Credit Facility amounting to
€37,395 was written off. In addition, on December 22, 2003, the Company wrote off the unamortized balance of debt
issuance costs related to the Mezzanine subordinated bonds and the debt discounts on the Mezzanine subordinated
bonds and deferrals. These amounts were presented as Loss on Extinguishment of Debt in the Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Operations. See Note 7 for more information on the modification to the Senior Credit
Facility.

**_Recent Accounting Pronouncements_**

In December 2003, the FASB issued a revised SFAS No. 132, _Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and_
_Other Postretirement Benefits - an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106. This Statement revises_
employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement
or recognition of those plans required by SFAS No. 87, SFAS No. 88, and SFAS No. 106. This Statement retains the
disclosure requirements contained in SFAS No. 132, which it replaces. It requires additional disclosures to those in the
original SFAS No. 132 about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension
plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. The revised SFAS No. 132 does not have a material impact on
the Company’s results of operation or financial position.

**3.** **ACQUISITIONS**

During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company purchased Codenet SA and its subsidiaries and certain assets and
liabilities of Canal+ NV and Sinfilo NV, all companies organized under the laws of Belgium. Codenet is a Belgian broadband internet,
data and voice provider serving business customers throughout Belgium and parts of Luxembourg. Codenet was purchased from a
subsidiary of Suez Lyonnaise des Eaux SA (“Suez”), an indirect shareholder in Electrabel which is a shareholder in the Company.
The Company purchased substantially all of the assets and liabilities of Canal+ related to the conduct of the premium pay business
in Flanders as well as with respect to the Flemish speaking subscribers in Brussels. The Company also purchased substantially all
of the assets and liabilities of Sinfilo related to installed and operational WiFi hotspots throughout Belgium. The aggregate net
purchase price of these acquisitions was approximately [€30,006 and included approximately €26,705 in cash (including the purchase]
of a receivable held by Suez against Codenet), 120,000 shares of Company common stock with an aggregate value of [€2,700 and]

€601 in transaction costs. With respect to the Canal+ transaction, the Company has established an accrual of €7,178 in Other
Current Assets for the expected value of purchase price adjustments and indemnities received from the seller for certain liabilities
assumed by the Company.

The excess of the purchase price over the allocated fair value of net tangible assets acquired was approximately [€18,037. ]
Of this amount, approximately [€14,473 was assigned to customer lists and €2,051 was assigned to supply contracts and are]
amortized over their useful lives of 5 years. The remaining [€477 of acquired intangible assets relates primarily to software and has a]
weighted-average useful life of approximately 3 years. The remaining excess purchase price of approximately [€1,036 represents]
acquired goodwill.

**6.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS**

In connection with the adoption of SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets ("SFAS No. 142"), the
Company completed a transitional impairment test of its goodwill in 2002 and performed its annual review for
impairment during the third quarter of 2003. Goodwill was computed based on one reporting unit.

Fair value was determined based on discounted cash flows using reasonable and appropriate assumptions that
are consistent with internal forecasts. Upon implementation of SFAS No. 142, the Company determined that goodwill
was impaired and recorded the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle by an impairment of [€667,628]
for the year ended December 31, 2002. The earnings forecast for the Company was revised in 2003 mainly to reflect
the Company's assessment of changes in the Belgian markets for the telephony and Internet services. As a result, the
Company recognized an impairment charge of [€336,000 in the third quarter of 2003. The tax impact recorded on these]
impairments is nil as a full valuation allowance is applied against all net deferred tax assets.

The Company’s intangible assets other than goodwill each have a finite life and are comprised primarily of
network user rights, software development and acquisition costs, customer lists, contracts with suppliers and trade
name. These intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. The Company
evaluates the estimated useful lives of its finite intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events or
circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives. In connection with various acquisitions made by the Company,
certain identifiable intangible assets, including customer lists, supply contracts and the “Telenet” trade name, were
recorded separate from goodwill. The identified intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over 3 to
20 years.

Summarized below are the carrying value and accumulated amortization of intangible assets that will continue
to be amortized under SFAS No. 142, as well as the carrying amount of goodwill, which is not amortized.

**_Senior Notes_**

On December 22, 2003, Telenet Communications issued Senior Notes with a principal amount of [€500,000,]
receiving net proceeds of [€482,310. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually at an annual rate of 9%. The notes]
do not have required principal repayments prior to maturity on December 15, 2013. The utilization of the net proceeds
from the notes issued is described below.

**_Senior Discount Notes_**

On December 22, 2003, the Company issued Senior Discount Notes at 57.298% of par value with a principal
amount at maturity of $558,000 (or [€450,654 using the exchange rate obtained upon the Refinancing of $1.2382 per]
€1.00), receiving net proceeds of €242,527. Interest on the notes started accreting from December 22, 2003 at an
annual rate of 11.5%, compounded semi-annually. Commencing on June 15, 2009 until maturity on June 15, 2014,
interest is payable semi-annually at an annual rate of 11.5%. There are no required principal repayments prior to
maturity. The utilization of the net proceeds from the notes issued is described below.

**_Senior Credit Facility_**

In connection with the MixtICS Acquisition, the Company obtained in July 2002 a senior secured facility for a
total of up to [€1,250,000 of financing from a syndicate of lenders in various tranches (the "Senior Credit Facility"). In]
April 2003, the Senior Credit Facility was amended. Among other modifications, these amendments reduced the total
credit facility from [€1,250,000 to €1,185,000, increased the interest margin and commitment fees and revised the]
financial covenants.

Upon issuance of the Senior Notes and the Senior Discount Notes on December 22, 2003, the Company
further modified the Senior Credit Facility. Among other modifications, the amount available under Tranche D was
increased to [€100,000 and a new non-amortizing Tranche E was created while a portion of the amounts outstanding on]
other tranches were paid down. Tranche E provides a [€300,000 term loan facility expiring in 2009 which bears interest]
at EURIBOR plus a margin of 3.5%.

Outstanding borrowings and total undrawn balances under the Senior Credit Facility are as follows:

**_Refinancing_**

A refinancing plan was completed by the Company in December 2003 whereby the Company issued Senior
Notes and Senior Discount Notes, modified its Senior Credit Facility and repaid outstanding deferred payment
obligations and subordinated shareholder loans (the "Refinancing"). The main purpose of the Refinancing was to
simplify the capital structure by reducing the number of debt instruments outstanding while extending the average
duration and reducing the cost of funding of the outstanding debt.

The Company has used [€455,000 of the proceeds to reduce existing indebtedness under Tranches] A, B and C1
of the Senior Credit Facility, [€262,679 to repay outstanding deferred payment obligations to the mixed intercommunales]
in connection with the MixtICS Acquisition, [€102,425 to repay the HFC upgrade deferrals and €90,100 to repay]
subordinated shareholder loans owed to certain shareholders of Telenet.

As a result of the Refinancing, the Company wrote off on December 22, 2003, [€20,270 of debt issuance co]sts
related to the Senior Credit Facility and Mezzanine subordinated bonds and [€79,066 of debt discounts on the Senior]
Credit Facility, Mezzanine subordinated bonds and deferrals. Additionally, the Company incurred a redemption premium
of approximately [€9,208 upon repayment of certain of the subordinated shareholder loans and deferred payment]
obligations. These expenses were presented as Loss on Extinguishment of Debt in the Condensed Consolidated
Statement of Operations. The Company also incurred debt issuance costs of approximately [€37,155 for the Senior]
Notes and the Senior Discount Notes and the amendments to the Senior Credit Facility which have been capitalized in
Deferred Finance Costs and are amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method.

**9.  FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

The Company seeks to reduce its foreign currency exposure through a policy of matching, to the extent
possible, assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In addition, the Company uses certain derivative
financial instruments in order to manage its exposure to exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations arising from its
operations.  The Company has identified certain foreign exchange forward contracts as cash flow hedges under SFAS
133.  The Company is also exposed to credit risks.

**_Foreign Currency Cash Flow Hedges_**

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002
(in thousands of Euro, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)

Discount Notes, the Company purchased a series of foreign exchange forward contracts for a total nominal amount of
$558,000, which is the fully accreted value of the Senior Discount Notes as of December 15, 2008 (the “Full Accretion
Date”). The strategy is to hedge the maximum accreted amount, assuming, based on the redemption penalties that
would be incurred upon redemption prior to the Full Accretion Date, that there will be no optional redemption before
the Full Accretion Date.

The hedging instrument in this hedging relationship is the spot value of the foreign exchange forward contracts,
as defined by the difference between the spot rate at inception and the closing spot rate. The risk being hedged is the
variability of the Euro-equivalent cash flows related to the fully accreted amount of the Senior Discount Notes as of the
Full Accretion Date.

The hedge effectiveness test will be performed periodically, based on the U.S. dollar spot rate, comparing the
change in spot value of the foreign exchange forward contracts with the change in anticipated Euro-equivalent cash
flows upon the future repayment of the fully accreted value of the Senior Discount Notes. This implies that the impact
of ineffectiveness, together with changes in the fair value of the forward points on the foreign exchange forward
contracts, will be recorded directly through earnings.

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002 outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts that qualified as cash flow
hedges were as follows:

**_Credit Risk_**

Credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the Company would incur as a result of non-performance by
counterparties. The Company maintains credit risk policies with regard to its counterparties to minimize overall credit
risk. These policies include an evaluation of a potential counterparty's financial condition, credit rating, and other credit
criteria and risk mitigation tools as deemed appropriate.

The largest share of the gross assets subject to credit risk is accounts receivable from residential and small
commercial customers. The risk of material loss from nonperformance from these customers is not considered likely.
Reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable are provided for the potential loss from nonpayment by these customers
based on historical experience.

In regards to credit risk on financial instruments, the Company maintains a policy of entering into such
transactions only with highly rated European and U.S. financial institutions.

The fair value of our derivative financial instruments has been determined by commercial banks and validated
by our management. As regards to foreign exchange forward contracts qualifying for hedge accounting, their value
will be based on swap curves flat, without extra credit spreads. In practice, the fair values provided by our
counterparties in financial derivative instruments, which are commercial banks, will be used.

The fair values of our long-term debt instruments are derived as the lesser of either the call price of the
relevant instrument or the market value as determined by quoted market prices at each measurement date, where
available, or, where not available, at the present value of future cash flows discounted at rates consistent with
comparable maturities with similar credit risk to the appropriate measurement date.

The carrying amounts for financial assets classified as current assets and the carrying amounts for financial
liabilities classified as current liabilities approximate fair value due to the short maturity of such instruments. The fair
values of other financial instruments for which carrying amounts and fair values have not been presented are not
materially different than their related carrying amounts.

Management has applied its judgment in using market data to develop estimates of fair value. Accordingly, the
estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize in a current
market exchange.

(a) Each party to the Mixed Intercommunales has one golden share of Telenet which allows them to monitor the Public Interest
Guarantees by participation in Telenet’s regulatory board. Public Interest Guarantees include guarantees on price and content of the
basic package, roll-out obligations for the digital platform and provision of public services which utilize new technologies.

(b) On December 9, 2003, pursuant to the acquisition of Codenet, 120,000 shares of Telenet were issued to a subsidiary of Suez
Lyonnaise des Eaux.

**_Warrants_**

The 100,000 warrants previously issued to the lenders under the Senior Credit Facility are no longer held by the
lenders and all but 15,714 have been cancelled. The remaining 15,714 warrants were transferred as part of the
settlement of the subordinated shareholder debts that were repaid on December 22, 2003. Concurrent with the
issuance of the Senior Notes and the Senior Discounts Notes, and the modification of the Senior Credit Facility, all
other previously vested warrants except for two vested Penny Warrants that were issued in August of 2002 were
exchanged for 3,426,000 newly issued Subordinated Debt Warrants. The two vested Penny Warrants were exercised,
resulting in the issuance of 283,821 shares of Telenet. All previously issued warrants that remained unvested as of
December 22, 2003 were cancelled as of that date.

In connection with the exchange of vested warrants, the Company recorded a charge of [€8,040, which is]
included in Other Financial Expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The amount of the
charge is based upon the difference between the fair value (as determined under the Black-Scholes pricing model) of
the newly issued Subordinated Debt Warrants compared to the fair value of the old warrants that were given up by the
holders in exchange for the newly issued Subordinated Debt Warrants.

Each Subordinated Debt Warrant was fully vested upon issuance and is exchangeable into one share of
Telenet at an exercise price of [€40.00 at any time up to August 9, 2009.]

**12.  OTHER LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES**

**_Service and Transfer Agreement with Electrabel_**

As part of the MixtICS Acquisition in August 2002, the Company entered into a service and transfer
agreement with Electrabel. Pursuant to this agreement, Electrabel agreed to provide certain operational services (such
as installation, maintenance and call centre services) to the Company from August 9, 2002 through the later of
(i) February 9, 2004 and (ii) the date on which the purchase price, including the deferrals (see Note 7), has been fully
paid.

Pursuant to the Refinancing, the remainder of the purchase price, including all deferrals has been paid.
However, notwithstanding the terms of the service and transfer agreement regarding the expiration of Electrabel’s
obligation to provide certain operational services, MixtICS and Electrabel have agreed in principle to postpone the date
upon which Electrabel’s responsibilities transfer to MixtICS from February 9, 2004 until April 1, 2004. However, the
parties to the agreement have not yet agreed on the method to compute the liabilities that will be transferred. As the
Company can not estimate the potential liability that may result from the transfer of the personnel, no amounts have
been allocated to this contingency in the MixtICS purchase price allocation and no liability has been accounted for as of
December 31, 2003.

**_Copyright Litigation_**

The Company, together with other Belgian cable operators, continued negotiations with certain of the
broadcasters and copyright collection agencies in Belgium that determined the copyright fees due by cable operators.
The Belgian Radio and Television Distributors association (Beroepsvereniging voor Radio- en Televisiedistributie)
("RTD") has been assisting us and other cable operators in this process.

In January 2004, the Company received formal notification of the ruling of February 2003, with respect to the
suit with the Foreign Public Broadcasters, the Commercial Court in Brussels, which ruled that for the period from 1996
through 2001 the Foreign Public Broadcasters are entitled to approximately [€47.7] million, for which we have joint and
several liability. The Company's additional liability subsequent to this ruling was estimated to be [€21.6] million for the
period from 1996 through 2001 (provided that the other members of RTD pay their proportionate share), together with
interest since June 1, 2002 at a current rate of 7% per year, with an additional [€8.0] million due for fiscal years 2002
and 2003. RTD appealed the court's decision and pending the outcome of ongoing negotiations at the time of the
formal notification, no payment was enforced on us.

The dispute with the Foreign Broadcasters was subsequently settled in March 2004. Pursuant to the terms of
the settlement agreement, we and Interkabel (representing the five pure intercommunales in Flanders) agreed to make
total payments over a four year period of approximately [€45.0 million. Telenet has provided for its share of this]
amount.

The Company remains in litigation with smaller copyright collection agencies and broadcasters and has reached
an agreement in principle on some of the outstanding terms.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company retained an accrual of [€40,490 ]in other liabilities for the amounts that
the Company expects to pay as a result of the above settlements.

**_Interconnection Litigation_**

The Company has been involved in legal proceedings with Belgacom related to the increased interconnection
fees that have been charged since August 2002 to telephone operators to terminate calls made to end users on the
Company's network.

Telenet obtained approval from the Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications (BIPT) to
increase its interconnection rates for inbound domestic calls in August 2002. Belgacom increased the tariffs charged to

(in thousands of Euro, except per share amounts, unless otherwise stated)

its telephony customers calling Telenet numbers to reflect our increased termination rates.

Belgacom challenged the Company's increased interconnection termination rates before the Commercial Court
of Mechelen (Rechtbank van Koophandel) alleging abusive pricing. Belgacom has further challenged the BIPT's
approval of Telenet's increased domestic interconnection termination rates before the Council of State (Raad van
State), the highest administrative court in Belgium. The council may affirm the BIPT's decision or return the case to
the BIPT for reconsideration. The Council of State rejected an emergency request from Belgacom to suspend the
implementation of the increased interconnection termination rate.

On January 20, 2004, the President of the Commercial Court in Mechelen rendered a judgement in the case
where Belgacom contested the validity of Telenet's interconnection tariffs which was heard on September 23, 2003.
The judgement stated that there is no indication that Telenet's interconnection tariffs constitute a breach of the unfair
trade practices law, competition law or pricing regulations as invoked by Belgacom. As a result, the judge determined
that Belgacom's potential claim is limited to a contractual matter upon which the judge who heard the case was not
competent to rule, considering the nature of the procedure initiated by Belgacom. The judge therefore dismissed the
claim.

Belgacom can appeal this judgement. Belgacom can also decide to lodge a new case based on contractual grounds only.
The judgement does not require Telenet to change the interconnection rates it currently charges to Belgacom and which were
approved in 2002 by the BIPT.

ITEM 2 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

**Introduction**

The following discussion and analysis is based on the unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial
statements of Telenet Group Holding as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and December 31,
2002, with selected analysis based on the three months ended September 30, 2003 as compared to the three months
ended December 31, 2003, in all cases prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We have included selected financial
information on Telenet Group Holding as of and for the relevant periods. You should read the unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements attached hereto, including the notes thereto, together with the following discussion and
analysis.

Telenet Group Holding is a holding company that does not conduct any business operations of its own.
Substantially all the assets of Telenet Group Holding consist of shares of its subsidiary Telenet Communications and
intercompany loans made to Telenet Communications in connection with the acquisition of our network from the mixed
intercommunales (“MICs”) in August 2002 (the “MixtICS Acquisition”) and with the refinancing that took place on
December 22, 2003 (the “Refinancing”).  These intercompany loans bear interest at a rate that is substantially similar
to the rate at which debt incurred by Telenet Group Holding bears interest. Except for the impact of presenting as
equity detachable warrants issued by Telenet Group Holding, the financial position and results of operations of Telenet
Group Holding is substantially the same as the financial position and results of operations of Telenet Communications
for the relevant periods.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains
forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those that we discuss in these
forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to,
those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly under "Information Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements."

**Annualized Information Based on Fourth Quarter 2003 Results** **Euro millions**

Net cash pay debt[(1)] ........................................................................................ 1,288.3
Annualized EBITDA[(2)].................................................................................... 251.2
_Pro forma annualized cash interest expense[(1)]_ .................................................. 101.7
Ratio of net cash pay debt to Annualized EBITDA ........................................... 5.1x
Ratio of net debt to Annualized EBITDA ........................................................ 6.1x
Ratio of Annualized EBITDA to pro forma annualized cash interest expense..... 2.5x

(1) Cash interest expense excludes non-cash items such as amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs and excludes expenses
such as currency hedging costs and other borrowing expenses, such as withholding tax and commitment fees. Cash pay debt includes
third party debt on which cash interest is payable from the date of issuance, and excludes the Senior Discount Notes on which interest
is accruing on a discounted basis and for which cash interest is not payable until June 15, 2009. _Pro forma_ cash interest expense is
calculated assuming that actual cash pay debt balances were outstanding for an annual period at rates in effect or assumed to be in effect
at December 31, 2003.

(2) Annualized EBITDA is calculated by multiplying our EBITDA of [€62.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003 by]
four. We believe this is a more useful measure of performance than our last twelve month or annual EBITDA because it reflects the
benefit of cable price increases implemented during the past year, growth in our Internet and telephony businesses and the initial
impact of the acquisitions made in December 2003.

**Recent Developments**

**_Canal+ Acquisition_**

We closed the acquisition of the Flemish assets of Canal+ (the “Canal+ Acquisition”) on December 31, 2003
with financial effect from December 1, 2003. Pursuant to the Canal+ Acquisition, we provide a range of analog and
digital premium movie, sports and other programming through a proprietary set top box connected to subscribers’
televisions. As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately 145,900 subscribers on both our network as well as on
the network of the pure intercommunales (the “PICs”). Through our subsidiary PayTVCo NV, we directly bill the
cable users who subscribe to these premium programming services and pay the PICs a carriage fee for the distribution
of content to our premium subscribers on their network.

As our core business is distribution, in the longer term we may transfer to a third party the programming
contracts we acquired from Canal+. Pursuant to the closing of the Canal+ Acquisition, we are now subject to the
programming contracts to which Canal+ was previously subject, obligating us to pay certain studios and others suppliers
of programming for content rights on a minimum guaranteed subscriber basis irrespective of the actual numbers of
subscribers purchasing content.

Our cable television revenue base has expanded with sales of Canal+ premium movie, sports and other content
to our subscribers and those of the PICs. These revenues are partially offset by the loss of the carriage fees we
previously received from Canal+. We are also incurring significant additional cable programming costs associated with
the acquired content rights. The Canal+ Acquisition has a negative impact on our margins.

The successful completion of the Canal+ Acquisition resolved previous litigation with Canal+ concerning our
termination of our contractual arrangements.

**_Codenet Acquisition_**

On December 9, 2003, we acquired Codenet, a broadband Internet, data and voice provider operating primarily
in the business market throughout Belgium (the “Codenet Acquisition”). The Codenet Acquisition has expanded our
backbone network across all of Belgium and parts of Luxembourg, allowing us to directly provide business services
throughout Belgium. We expect that the transaction will further increase our ability to offer our business customers
comprehensive product sets, including leased lines and voice and data packages. Codenet's ATM network capabilities,
for example, permit the offering of frame relay technology, which businesses commonly use as a secure means of data
transport. The Codenet Acquisition is therefore expected to allow us to more efficiently market to a broader base of
small and medium sized enterprises ("SMEs") and to companies operating on a national level, with the benefit of an
enhanced product set and geographic coverage.

The Codenet Acquisition contributed to our consolidated revenue with financial effect from December 1, 2003.

326


-----

However, Codenet has lower operating margins than Telenet because of, among other things, Codenet's use of leased
lines provided by Belgacom. Over time, we expect to replace Belgacom as Codenet's provider of leased lines in
Flanders, to the extent possible.

In connection with the recent Canal+ Acquisition and Codenet Acquisition, we paid combined purchase prices
of approximately [€25] million in cash, net of cash acquired, and we expect that our available liquidity will be adversely
affected during the next two years. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources."

**_MixtICS Integration_**

A services and transfer agreement (the "Services and Transfer Agreement") was entered into by Electrabel
and MixtICS upon the acquisition of our network from the mixed intercommunales in August 2002 (the “MixtICS
Acquisition”), pursuant to which Electrabel agreed to provide MixtICS with operational services following the
acquisition. The Services and Transfer Agreement was amended as of the closing of the Refinancing. We
subsequently have integrated many of these services into our business (including network maintenance, billing and
repair) and are in the process of integrating the remaining services (including network installation, payroll, financial
control and logistics). We plan to complete this integration by the middle of 2004. As we continue to migrate the cable
television functions from Electrabel, we expect some increases in expenses for certain services as compared with fees
charged by Electrabel for the relevant services under the Services and Transfer Agreement. We also expect increased
education and training costs associated with the transfer of approximately 400 employees from Electrabel. See note 12
to our financial statements. Management expects, over time, to offset the additional costs, in part, by improved
efficiencies in network maintenance and employee utilization rates.

Concurrently with the continuing integration of MixtICS, we plan to migrate all of our businesses, including
MixtICS, to an integrated data management and reporting platform using an Oracle enterprise resource planning
("ERP") system, for which we expect to incur limited capital expenditure and which could initially result in difficulties in
our data collection, reporting and customer service.

(1) Each subscriber is counted as a revenue generating unit, or "RGU," for each service subscribed. Thus, a subscriber or customer who
receives from us basic cable television, premium cable television, broadband Internet and residential telephony services (regardless of its
number of telephony access lines) would be counted as four RGUs. RGUs are presented as of the relevant period end date.

(2) Premium cable television services were introduced by Telenet with effect from December 1, 2003 following the Canal+ Acquisition.
The ARPU for premium cable television service is based on the revenues and average subscribers for the period December 1 to
December 31, 2003.

(3) Includes households and small businesses with up to four employees (“SoHos”) that receive our broadband Internet and telephony
services through a coaxial connection.

(4) These statistics also include approximately 29,000 and 23,000 RGUs who used our carrier preselection services at September 30, 2003
and December 31, 2003, respectively. Subscribers of Phone Plus, the residential business acquired with the Codenet Acquisition, are
not included in these statistics.

(5) Consists of small and medium enterprise (“SME”) RGUs that receive our broadband Internet and telephony services through a coaxial
connection. We had approximately 17,000 and 18,000 SME broadband Internet customers at September 30, 2003 and December 31,
2003, respectively, and 4,000 SME telephony customers at September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2003. We also provide business
services to SME and corporate RGUs that receive our services using a fiber connection and to business customers we acquired with the
Codenet Acquisition, which RGUs are not included in the above RGU calculations.

(6) Revenue earned for the period divided by three (with the exception of premium cable television services – see footnote 2) and divided
by the average number of RGUs for the period (which average number of RGUs may vary from the number of RGUs presented above
at the period end date).

(7) Average monthly revenue per subscriber includes copyright fees and other revenue earned from carriage fees.

(8) Average monthly revenue per subscriber excludes installation fees.

(9) Average monthly revenue per subscriber excludes interconnection revenue and installation fees but includes revenue generated by
RGUs who use our carrier preselection services. See footnote 4. Average monthly revenue per subscriber excluding RGUs who use our

**Three Months Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2003**

The financial information for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2003 included in
the discussion set forth below is derived from a combination of Telenet Group Holding's unaudited condensed
consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the selected additional
information provided for the three months ended September 30, 2003.

329


-----

**_Revenues_**

Revenues increased by [€16.5] million, or 13.0%, from [€126.7] million for the three months ended September 30,
2003 to [€143.2] million for the three months ended December 31, 2003. Our basic and premium cable television
business generated [€55.8] million, or 39.0%, of our consolidated revenues for the three months ended December 31,
2003, while our residential broadband Internet and telephony businesses generated [€42.0] million and [€33.6] million, or
29.3% and 23.4%, of our consolidated revenues respectively for the three months ended December 31, 2003. Sales of
business services were [€11.9] million, or 8.3% of our consolidated revenues, for the three months ended December 31,
2003.

The Canal+ Acquisition introduced a new revenue stream as from December 1, 2003, which accounted for
3.5% of our consolidated revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003. Business services, which are now
marketed under the “Telenet Solutions” brand name, also included one month of revenues from the Codenet
Acquisition, which accounted for 1.8% of our consolidated revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003.
Excluding the impacts of the Codenet Acquisition and Canal+ Acquisition, our consolidated revenues increased by
6.2% from the three months ended September 30, 2003 to the three months ended December 31, 2003.

_Cable Television_

We generated [€55.8] million of cable television revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2003,
compared with [€50.0] million for the three months ended September 30, 2003. The increase was principally a result of
the Canal+ Acquisition, which resulted in one month of new revenues from premium pay television customers, which
more than offset the cessation of revenue we previously received for distribution of the Canal+ content on our
network.

Revenues from our basic cable television service were positively impacted to a limited extent during the three
months ended December 31, 2003 by a combination of a full quarter of the second increase in cable television
subscription fees during the year (originally raised by an average of 15% in January 2003 and a further 10% of the
original amount in July 2003), increased copyright fees (raised from an average of [€1.08 to €1.81 per subscriber per]
month in August 2003) and a 1% increase in the number of basic cable subscribers. The increase in basic cable
subscribers was primarily the result of management focus on the billing records for this service, a process which
remains ongoing following the migration of the basic cable billing system to Telenet’s billing system and which is
anticipated to result in potential fluctuations in basic cable subscriber numbers until the process is completed in the
coming months. We anticipate that the recent price increases and recent introduction of basic cable television billing
under the “Mixt-ICS” letterhead following the billing migration will result in higher call center activity while customers
familiarize themselves with these changes.

_Residential Broadband Internet_

Revenues generated by our residential broadband Internet business continued to grow, by 10.9%, from
€37.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2003 to €42.0 million for the three months ended December 31,
2003. Increased residential broadband Internet revenues were primarily the result of net growth, at 8.4%, of residential
broadband Internet subscribers for the three months ended December 31, 2003. ARPU increased by [€1.1 per month]
as a result of increased sales of value-added services and increased revenues from ancillary fees. Churn in our
residential broadband Internet business was 7.0% for the three months ended December 31, 2003, an improvement on
the churn rate of 7.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2003.

_Residential Telephony_

Residential telephony revenue (including interconnection revenue for both residential subscribers and business
customers) increased for the three months ended December 31, 2003, by 9.7%, from [€30.6] million for the three months
ended September 30, 2003 to [€33.6] million for the three months ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily
due to net subscriber growth of 5.5% between September 30, 2003 and December 31, 2003 following the introduction
of a new tariff scheme on September 1, 2003 and, to a lesser extent, the addition of revenues from the residential
carrier pre-select business Phone Plus, which was acquired as part of the Codenet Acquisition in December 2003.
Excluding the impact of the Phone Plus revenues, residential telephony revenue grew 6.7% during the three months

330


-----

ended December 31, 2003 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2003.

The new tariff scheme introduced in September 2003 provides for reduced rates on certain types of calls and
is available to both new as well as existing subscribers, should existing subscribers choose to switch to the new plan.
Notwithstanding this impact, our ARPU increased by [€0.8 for the three months ended December 31, 2003 compared to]
the three months ended September 30, 2003. This was the result of the positive impact of seasonality, since the
summer months of the third quarter typically exhibit lower usage revenues compared the fourth quarter, partly offset by
the impact of our new tariff scheme. Our ARPU was also positively influenced by the continuing migration of our
carrier pre-select customers (who pay us usage fees only) to directly connected customers (paying both subscription
and usage fees to us). Churn in our residential telephony business remained low at 7.8% for the three months ended
December 31, 2003, an improvement on the churn rate of 9.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2003.

_Business Services_

Business services revenues increased by 44.3%, from [€8.2] million for the three months ended September 30,
2003 to [€11.9] million for the three months ended December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of
approximately one month of revenues contributed by Codenet following the Codenet Acquisition and a year end
revenue accrual reconciliation of [€0.5 million. Excluding these two items, business services revenues grew 5.9% in]
the three months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2003.

**_Expenses_**

_Operating Expenses_

Operating expenses increased by [€8.1] million, or 21.2%, from [€38.3] million for the three months ended
September 30, 2003 to [€46.4] million for the three months ended December 31, 2003. For the three months ended
December 31, 2003, operating expenses increased primarily as a result of anticipated operating expenses incurred
following the Codenet and Canal+ Acquisitions. In addition, we incurred increased customer care costs in the fourth
quarter of 2003 following the migration of basic cable television billing to our system and the rollout of our Sinfilo WiFi
operation.

As a percentage of revenues, operating expenses were 30.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2003
and 32.4% for the three months ended December 31, 2003.

_Selling, General and Administrative Expenses_

Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by [€8.8 million, or 34.7%, from €25.3] million for the
three months ended September 30, 2003 to [€34.0] million for the three months ended December 31, 2003, as a result of
a combination of non-recurring costs we incurred in relation to the integration of our acquisitions, higher selling and
marketing costs as a result of our 26% increase in net broadband Internet and telephony RGU additions and in
response to the increased competitive environment, increased expenses resulting from the Refinancing and the higher
cost base of the businesses acquired pursuant to the Codenet and Canal+ Acquisitions. We believe it is possible that
certain aspects of the integration process, such as data migration, may result in limited additional short term costs.

Our EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2003 was [€62.8 million compared to €63.2 million in]
the three months ended September 30, 2003, for the reasons described above. We believe that our EBITDA for the
three months ended December 31, 2003 was adversely impacted by [€1.5 million of net non-recurring items. Our]
EBITDA margin decreased from 49.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2003 to 43.8% for the three
months ended December 31, 2003 as a result of the anticipated deterioration in margin caused by the Codenet and
Canal+ Acquisitions and of the other factors described above. Since the Codenet and Canal+ Acquisitions impacted
only one out of the three months ended December 31, 2003, we anticipate that the these acquisitions will have a further
adverse impact on our EBITDA margin in the first quarter of 2004.

_Depreciation and Amortization Expense_

Depreciation expense increased by [€2.7] million, from [€35.4] million for the three months ended September 30,
2003 to [€38.1] million for the three months ended December 31, 2003. As a percentage of revenues, depreciation

331


-----

expenses were 28.1% for the three months ended September 30, 2003 and 26.6% for the three months ended
December 31, 2003. The three months ended December 31, 2003 included [€0.8 million of depreciation expense from]
operations acquired pursuant to the Codenet and Canal+ Acquisitions.

Amortization expense decreased by [€332.7] million, from [€343.3] million for the three months ended
September 30, 2003 to [€10.5] million for the three months ended December 31, 2003. The decrease was substantially
the result of a [€336] million impairment of our goodwill relating to an impairment analysis under SFAS No. 142
performed in the third quarter of 2003.

**_Operating Profit_**

Our operating loss of [€315.5] million for the three months ended September 30, 2003 was followed by an
increase in operating profit of [€329.7 million to an operating profit of €14.2] million for the three months ended
December 31, 2003, as a result of the factors described above.

**_Other Income (Expense)_**

_Interest Income (Expense)_

Net interest expense decreased by [€1.3 million, from €40.1] million for the three months ended September 30,
2003 to [€38.8 million for the three months ended December] 31, 2003, primarily as a result of the favorable unwinding
of an interest rate hedge and the higher interest income we earned on our cash balances in the fourth quarter of 2003.
See note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements for additional information on our financing
facilities. As a percentage of revenues, net interest expense was 31.6% for the three months ended September 30,
2003 and 27.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2003.

_Net Foreign Exchange Gain (Loss)_

Our net foreign exchange loss of [€203,000 for the three months ended September] 30, 2003 increased to [€3.3]
million in the three months ended December 31, 2003, as a result of change in the market value of our currency
hedges.

_Other Financial Expenses_

In connection with the exchange of vested warrants, the Company recorded a charge of [€8.0 million, which is]
included in Other Financial Expenses in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations. The amount of the
charge is based upon the difference between the fair value (as determined under the Black-Scholes pricing model) of
the newly issued Subordinated Debt Warrants compared to the fair value of the old warrants that were given up by the
holders in exchange for the newly issued Subordinated Debt Warrants. In addition, the Company recorded a loss of
€12.7 million on the mark to market value of its foreign exchange forward contracts which is described also in note 9 to
our Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial statements.

_Loss on Extinguishment of Debt_

As a result of the Refinancing, the Company wrote off on December 22, 2003, [€20.3 million of debt issuance]
costs related to the Senior Credit Facility and Mezzanine subordinated bonds and [€79.1 million of debt discounts on the]
Senior Credit Facility, Mezzanine subordinated bonds and deferrals. Additionally, the Company incurred a redemption
premium of approximately [€9.2 million upon repayment of certain of the subordinated shareholder loans and deferred]
payment obligations. These expenses were presented as Loss on Extinguishment of Debt in the Condensed
Consolidated Statement of Operations.

**_Net Loss_**

Net loss decreased by [€198.5] million, from [€355.8] million for the three months ended September 30, 2003 to
€157.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003, as a result of the factors described above.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

332


-----

_We have not presented cash flow statements, but provide below some indications of the key trends_
_affecting our liquidity._

**_Capital Expenditure_**

Our business is highly capital intensive. Capital expenditure on fixed assets was [€25.8] million for the three
months ended September 30, 2003 and [€32.7] million for the three months ended December 31, 2003. During both
quarters, a significant portion of our purchases of fixed assets (excluding those acquired through the Canal+ and
Codenet Acquisitions) was related to capital expenditures for customer premise equipment and related installation costs
for new subscribers and to capital expenditures on network capacity which was also related to subscriber growth.

In the three months ended December 31, 2003, we incurred an initial [€1.7 million in capital expenditures for the]
installation of our voice over Internet protocol (VoIP) platform. During the same period, we incurred net capital
expenditure on interactive digital television development (after taking into account our government subsidy) of
approximately [€5 million.]

**_Available Liquidity_**

We maintain cash and cash equivalents to fund the day-to-day cash requirements of our business. We hold
cash primarily in euros. We held [€171.0 million of cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2003, as compared]
with [€53.7 million as of September 30, 2003. Following the Refinancing, our cash and cash equivalents included €100]
million of cash which we intend to apply to reduce our cash pay debt.

Our cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2003 reflects payment of the cash consideration of the
Canal+ and Codenet Acquisitions. We paid combined purchase prices, including transaction expenses and net of cash
acquired, of approximately [€26] million. As was previously anticipated, we estimate that we will incur an additional
€10 million to €15 million negative cash impact as a result of these acquisitions within the next two years.

Following the Refinancing, tranche D of the senior credit facility, which is a [€100] million undrawn revolving
credit facility, is available to us subject to our being in compliance with certain financial covenants and other conditions.
In addition, giving effect to the Refinancing and the [€40 million drawing under tranche C2 of the senior credit facility on]
November 3, 2003, an additional [€40] million remains available under tranche C2 of the senior credit facility for general
corporate purposes, subject to certain covenants and conditions. The senior credit facility is discussed in greater detail
in note 7 to our Condensed Consolidated Interim Financial Statements.

The principal risks to our sources of liquidity are operational risks, including risks associated with decreased
pricing, reduced subscriber growth, increased marketing costs and other consequences of increasing competition and
our shortage of Motorola telephony modems and roll-out of VoIP. Our ability to service our debt (including payments
on the Notes) and to fund our ongoing operations will depend on our ability to generate cash. We have not made a
profit since the Telenet group was formed in 1996 and have a history of negative net cash flows after deducting
interest and taxes. Although we expect to continue to report losses in the foreseeable future, we anticipate generating
positive cash flow after deducting interest and taxes, but cannot assure you that this will be the case.

Telenet Group Holding is a holding company with no source of operating income. It is therefore dependent on
capital raising abilities and dividend payments from subsidiaries to generate funds. The terms of the senior credit
facility, our other outstanding debt and the indenture governing the Senior Discount Notes and the Senior Notes issued
by Telenet Communications contain a number of significant covenants that restrict our ability, and the ability of our
subsidiaries to, among other things, pay dividends or make other distributions, make capital expenditure and incur
additional debt and grant guarantees. Furthermore, the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other
payments to us may be restricted by, among other things, other agreements and legal prohibitions on such payments.

Although the cash portion of our interest expense has increased substantially following the Refinancing, we
believe that our cash flow from operations and our existing cash resources, the amended and extended amortisation
schedule of our senior credit facility, together with available borrowings under the senior credit facility, will be sufficient
to fund our currently anticipated working capital needs, capital expenditures and debt service requirements, although
we cannot assure you that this will be the case.

**_Contingent Liabilities and Commitments_**

For a discussion of our contingent liabilities and commitments, some of which are significant, see note 12 to our
financial statements. In connection with litigation concerning the basis for our computation of copyright fees, as of
December 31, 2003 we had accrued a liability of approximately [€40.5] million.

**_Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements_**

Historically, we have not used special-purposes vehicles or similar financing arrangements. In addition, we do
not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements with any of our affiliates or with any unconsolidated entities.

**_Lack of Tax Consolidation_**

To the extent mismatches between taxable income and deductible expenses occur within the Telenet group,
our ability to generate cash flow could be adversely affected (because Belgian tax law does not provide for group-wide
consolidation).

ITEM 3 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

We are exposed to market risks relating to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates, primarily
as between the U.S. dollar and euro, and use financial instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate and foreign
exchange rate fluctuations.

_Interest Rate and Related Risk_

We are exposed to changes in interest rates because a large portion of our borrowings are variable rate debts.
Accordingly, our debt service obligations under such indebtedness fluctuate as interest rates change. In order to
mitigate this exposure, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements, caps and best of swap and cap
combination agreements. Pursuant to interest rate swap agreements, at specified intervals, we pay a fixed interest rate
and receive a variable interest rate calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. Our hedging
strategy was based on a close to 100% coverage of the anticipated outstanding senior bank debt in the period 20022005. As result of lower than anticipated cash flow needs, the restructuring of the senior credit facility in April 2003
and finally a net reduction of the senior debt in December 2003, the total notional amount of interest derivative
instruments effective December 31, 2003 exceeded the amount of variable rate debt by [€247 million. Telenet is]
currently examining the restructuring of its interest rate hedging portfolio to reflect the newly anticipated debt structure.

As of December 31, 2003, we had entered into interest rate swap agreements for a notional principal amount
of [€471.7] million, and we paid fixed interest on the senior credit facility at a blended rate of 4.0% (plus the appropriate
margin for each tranche), resulting in additional cash interest expense given the fact that such rate was in excess of the
variable rate applicable to the respective borrowings. Caps are used to limit our exposure to, and to derive benefits
from, interest rate fluctuations on variable rate debt within a certain range of rates. As of December 31, 2003, we had
entered into cap agreements for a notional principal amount of [€784.2 million and an average cap interest rate of 4.0%.]
As of December 31, 2003, these cap agreements did not impact our cash interest expense. As of December 31, 2003
we had also entered into best of swap and cap combination agreements for a notional principal amount of [€ 284.2]
million and pay interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 6.1%. The respective best of swap and cap combination
agreements have not impacted our cash interest expense as of December 31, 2003 since their effective date is in
August 2005. Interest rate risk management agreements are not held or issued for speculative or trading purposes.
None of these derivative instruments is a qualifying hedge for purposes of SFAS No. 133.

Historically, and after giving effect to the Refinancing, only borrowings under the senior credit facility and the
lease of the building bear interest at variable rates. We have entered into transactions to hedge our interest rate risk for
the principal amount of all such debt.

For fixed rate debt, changes in interest rates generally affect the fair value of the debt instrument, but not our
earnings or cash flows. We do not currently have any obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and,
accordingly, interest rate risk and changes in fair market value should not have a significant effect on the fixed rate
debt until we would be required to refinance such debt. At December 31, 2003, we had outstanding fixed rate debt of
€756.5 million[(1)].

Under the terms of our senior credit facility, we are required, among other things, to make gross up payments
to nonresident lenders for interest payments made under the facility that are subject to Belgian withholding tax.
Withholding taxation rates vary between 0 and 15% (the highest withholding rate currently applicable under Belgian
law) depending upon the tax country of residence of the relevant lender and whether that country is party to a double
taxation treaty with Belgium. For the three months ended December 31, 2003, we paid approximately [€0.9] million in
such gross up payments. The percentage of the aggregate interest payable under the terms of our senior credit facility,
held by nonresident lenders, has increased from only 32.2% at the end of the period ending September 30, 2003 to 51%
at the end of the period ending December 31, 2003. If we had been required to make gross up payments on interest
paid to all of the lenders under our senior credit facility (which does not restrict transfers of interests in the facility to
nonresidents of Belgium) at the 15% withholding taxation rate, we would have had to make payments of approximately
€2.5 million for the three months ended December 31, 2003. On a pro forma basis to reflect the Refinancing and such
payments at the 15% withholding taxation rate, we would have had to make payments of approximately [€2.2] million for

the three months ended December 31, 2003.

_Foreign Currency Risk_

Our reporting currency is the euro. However, we conduct, and will continue to conduct, transactions in
currencies other than the euro, particularly the U.S. dollar. Approximately 8.7% of our costs of operations (primarily
the costs of network hardware and software equipment, management expenses under our strategic services agreement
with Cable Partners and advisory fees incurred in the high yield issuing process) for the three months ended December
31, 2003 were denominated in U.S. dollars, while all of our revenues were generated in Euros. Decreases in the value
of the Euro relative to the U.S. dollar would increase the cost in Euro of our U.S. dollar denominated costs and
expenses, while increases in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar would have the reverse effect. As at
December 31, 2003, the Euro had appreciated approximately 19.9% against the U.S. dollar since December 31, 2002.

We have historically hedged a portion of our U.S. dollar cash outflows arising on anticipated and committed
purchases through the use of foreign exchange derivative instruments. Although we take steps to protect ourselves
against the volatility of currency exchange rates, there is a residual risk that currency risks due to volatility in exchange
rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

In order to hedge the foreign exchange exposure resulting from the issuance of the $558 million Senior
Discount Notes by Telenet Group Holding, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts (for the
purchase of US dollars in exchange for Euros) for a total nominal amount of $558 million with a maturity at the end of
accretion period of the Senior Discount Notes on December 15, 2008 (the “Full Accretion Date”). These foreign
exchange forward contracts were dealt with an effective date close to the issuance of the Senior Discount Notes. The
underlying rationale of our hedging strategy is that the maximum accreted nominal amount is hedged given that our
functional currency is the Euro. This also assumes that there will be no optional redemption before the Full Accretion
Date. See note 9 to our condensed consolidated financial statements for further details of our hedging strategy.

Beginning in 2009, Telenet Group Holding will be required to make cash interest payments in U.S. dollars on
the Senior Discount Notes. We intend to enter into hedging arrangements as necessary to mitigate our exposure to
fluctuations in the U.S. dollar/Euro exchange rate with respect to interest payments and repayments of principal upon
maturity or earlier upon a redemption. Our current strategy is to hedge our exposure in respect of the accreted
principal amount of the Senior Discount Notes up to the Full Accretion Date and to review at a later stage our hedging
strategy with respect to cash interest and principal payments payable under the Senior Discount Notes after such date.

##### ANNEX E RECENT EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION

Fluctuations in the exchange rate between the euro and other currencies may affect our business. The
following chart shows for the period from January 1, 1999 through April 16, 2004, the period end, average, high and low
noon buying rates in The City of New York for cable transfers of euro as certified for customs purposes by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York expressed as U.S. dollars per [€1.00. The euro did not exist as a currency prior to]
January 1, 1999. The rates below may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial
statements and other financial information appearing in this offering memorandum. Our inclusion of these exchange
rates does not mean that the euro amounts actually represent such U.S. dollar amounts or that such amounts could
have been converted into U.S. dollars at any particular rate, if at all. The noon buying rate of the euro on April 16, 2004
was U.S.$1.2025= [€1.00.]

The exchange rates between the euro and the U.S. dollar for 1998 is derived from the exchange rate between
the Belgian Franc and the U.S. dollar, based on the noon buying rate in The City of New York for cable transfers of
Belgian Franc as certified for customs purposes by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the applicable period,
translated into euro at the fixed conversion rate of BEF40.3399 = [€1.00.]
