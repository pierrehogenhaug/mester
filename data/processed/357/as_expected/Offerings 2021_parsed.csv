357,Offerings 2021.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.1,PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER INFORMATION AND CERTAIN DEFINITIONS Presentation of Financial Information,7.1.1,Financial statements presented,"This Offering Memorandum contains the audited consolidated financial statements of the SN Issuer, the reporting entity for the Picard Group, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, as adopted by the European Union (“IFRS-EU” or “IFRS”), as of and for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (the “Audited Financial Statements”). Since April 1, 2019, the Group has applied IFRS 16 in accordance with the modified retrospective approach. The application of this standard significantly increases the Group’s EBITDA. The Group has chosen to apply IFRS 16 using the simplified retrospective approach as of April 1, 2019 and the March 31, 2019 financial statements and the March 31, 2018 financial statements have consequently not been restated. Prior to the adoption of this standard, rent expenses were recorded in the line item “other purchases and external expenses”. Following the adoption of this new standard, the Group has recognized right-of-use assets for its eligible stores and vehicles, which are depreciated over the lease term, depreciation charges being recorded in the line item “depreciation and amortization” of the Group income statement, and a corresponding lease liability initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that have not been paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. As a result of the significant changes caused by the application of IFRS 16, the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for periods prior to the year ended March 31, 2020 may not be comparable to financial information for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021. In December 2019, the IFRS interpretation committee (“IFRS IC”) published its decision clarifying the rules for determining the term of leases within the scope of IFRS 16. The application of this IFRS IC interpretation is a change in accounting method requiring a retrospective calculation of the impacts as of April 1, 2019 (applying the same incremental borrowing rates table as the one initially used by the Group at the first time application date, to the newly determined lease terms). The Group applied the IFRS IC interpretation relating to the assessment of leases with retroactive effect from April 1, 2019 and, consequently, in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, the comparative columns as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020 were recast (indicated as “restated”) to reflect a decision by the IFRS IC relating to the classification of leases under IFRS 16 (Leases). Therefore, the comparative financial information as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020 included in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, is not directly comparable to the financial information in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

357,Offerings 2021.md,7,FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,7.2,Other Financial Measures,7.2.1,,"The following are the primary EBITDA-based financial measures that are presented in this Offering Memorandum; they are derived from income statement account items calculated in accordance with IFRS-EU and are used by management as indicators of operating performance: EBITDA, which is a non-IFRS measure that represents operating profit before depreciation and amortization. EBITDA is derived from income statement line items calculated in accordance with IFRS. EBITDA differs from the definitions of “Consolidated EBITDA” and “EBITDA” under each Indenture and the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, respectively, which notably exclude certain exceptional and non-recurring items that are reflected in EBITDA. EBITDA to cash-flow conversion, which is a non-IFRS measure that represents net cash flows from operating activities before income tax paid plus net cash used in investing activities divided by EBITDA. EBITDA margin, which is a non-IFRS measure that represents EBITDA divided by sales of goods. x ----- Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-IFRS measure that represents EBITDA for the year ended March 31, 2021, adjusted for management fees, which management considers to be non-operational in nature as further described in footnote 5 under “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data—Other _Financial Data”._ Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA represents our EBITDA excluding the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on April 1, 2019. Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA margin represents our EBITDA margin excluding the impact of the application of IFRS 16 on April 1, 2019. The adjustments to EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA presented herein are for informational purposes only. This information is prepared on the basis of certain assumptions but such assumptions do not take into account all conceivable variables and are therefore inherently subject to risks and uncertainties and they may not give an accurate or complete picture of our financial condition or results of operations, may not be comparable to our consolidated financial statements or the other financial information included in this Offering Memorandum and undue reliance should not be placed upon them when evaluating an investment decision. Neither EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA nor Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA is a measurement of performance under IFRS and you should not consider EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA nor Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA as an alternative to operating profit or consolidated income, as a measure of our operating performance, cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as a measure of our ability to meet our cash needs or any other measures of performance under generally accepted accounting principles. We believe that EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA are useful indicators of our ability to incur and service our indebtedness and can assist securities analysts, investors and other parties to evaluate us. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA and similar measures are used by different companies for different purposes and are often calculated in ways that reflect the circumstances of those companies. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA may not be indicative of our historical operating results, nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider them in isolation. Some of these limitations are: - they do not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments; - they do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; - they do not reflect the significant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary, to service interest or principal payments on our debt; - although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often need to be replaced in the future and EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA do not reflect any cash requirements that would be required for such replacements; and - the fact that other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA differently than we do, which limits their usefulness as comparative measures. We also present like-for-like sales growth, which represents the change in sales from our directly-operated stores that have been open for more than 12 months in mainland France, excluding franchises in mainland France, Corsica, the French West Indies, New Caledonia and La Réunion, and also excluding Click & Collect sales. For the purpose of like-for-like calculations, a store will be included (i) on the first day of the twelfth month following its opening date if it was opened between the first and the fifteenth day of any given month and (ii) on the first day of the thirteenth month following its opening date in all other cases. Like-for-like sales growth is presented because we believe it is frequently used by investors and other interested parties in evaluating companies in the retail sector. However, other companies may define like-for-like sales growth in a different manner than we do. We also reflect some adjustments to our sales, based on either a positive or a negative calendar effect, e.g., due to the number of weekends or bank holidays, or events increasing traffic, such as Easter, in a period. Additionally, we present net debt, which represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents, and as adjusted net debt, which represents total debt minus cash and cash equivalents after giving effect to the Transactions (as defined herein). We also present net senior secured debt, which represents total debt secured by first ranking security interests over the Senior Secured Notes Collateral and total debt at non-Guarantors (but xi ----- excluding lease liabilities of such non-Guarantors following the adoption of IFRS 16) minus cash and cash equivalents, and as adjusted net senior secured debt, which represents net senior secured debt after giving effect to the Transactions (as defined herein). Pre-IFRS 16 Net debt as of March 31, 2021 is total debt, consisting of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Existing Senior Secured Notes (with a carrying value under IFRS of €1,245.4 million), bank guarantees (amounting to €2.7 million) and the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Existing Senior Notes (with a carrying value under IFRS of €308.7 million), minus cash and cash equivalents determined on the basis of IFRS prior to the application of IFRS 16 on April 1, 2019. Like-for-like sales growth, along with EBITDA, EBITDA to cash-flow conversion, EBITDA margin, Adjusted EBITDA, net debt, as adjusted net debt, net senior secured debt, as adjusted net senior secured debt, pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA, pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA margin and pre-IFRS net debt as presented in this Offering Memorandum are not measurements of financial performance and liquidity under IFRS-EU and should not be considered as alternatives to other indicators of our operating performance, cash flows or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with IFRS-EU. For a reconciliation of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to operating profit under IFRS-EU, see “Summary Historical Financial Information and Other Data”. Total retail France sales is a non-IFRS measure that represents our sales from in-store and Click & Collect sales in France (excluding Home Delivery, franchises and international sales). In addition, this Offering Memorandum presents “Normalized Sales” and “Normalized EBITDA”, which have been caculated using our results for the year ended March 31, 2020 as a reference year, as adjusted to reflect certain assumptions. These illustrations are not forecasts or estimates of our future results, but are merely illustrations of the possible movement in revenue and EBITDA under the assumptions discussed herein. Our actual results may differ considerably. See “Summary—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; illustrative _Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA” and “Risk Factors—Risks related to our Indebtedness and the Notes—Illustrative Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution when making an investment decision”._ These other financial measures contained in this Offering Memorandum are unaudited and have not been prepared in accordance with SEC requirements, IFRS-EU or the accounting standards of any other jurisdiction.

These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those identified under the “Risk Factors” section in this Offering Memorandum. Forward-looking statements include statements about expectations, beliefs, plans, objectives, intentions, assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical fact. Words or phrases such “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “may,” “intend,” “will,” “should,” “estimate” and similar expressions or the negatives of these words or phrases, may identify forward-looking statements, but the absence of these words does not necessarily mean that a statement is not forward-looking. Forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties and are based on assumptions that could potentially be inaccurate and that could cause future results to differ materially from those expected or implied by the forward-looking statements. Our future results could differ materially from those anticipated in our forward-looking statements for many reasons, including the factors described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” in this Offering Memorandum. For example, factors that could cause our future results to vary from projected future results include, but are not limited to: - the impact of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and other developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic; - our dependence on third-party suppliers to produce our products; - adverse developments with respect to the safety and quality of our products and/or the food industry in general or health concerns; - the failure to protect our image, reputation and brand; - the competitive environment in which we operate; - fluctuations in the price and availability of food ingredients, packaging materials and electricity; - changes in consumer preferences; - the failure to develop successful and innovative products; - the failure of our cold chain and the related risks of unsafe food conditions and increased costs; - our exposure to product liability claims; - social, economic and other trends affecting the food retail industry; - our ability to manage the expansion of our operations; - difficulties we may experience in the expansion of our operations, including our international expansion plans; - our strategy, outlook and growth prospects; - the disadvantages and risks related to the exploitation of certain stores as franchised stores; - the efficiency of our supply chain and information technology system; - the cost of complying with privacy and information laws and requirements and the impact of a breach of information security or privacy; - increased transportation costs or disruption of transportation services; - disruption in our workforce or the workforce of our suppliers; - our dependence on key executives and highly qualified managers; - the impact of laws and regulations on us and our operations; - increasingly stringent health, safety and environmental regulations; - the seasonality of our business, our revenue and our operating results; - risks relating to our leasehold property portfolio; - the failure to secure strategic locations for our stores; viii ----- - our obligation to make social security contributions; - risks relating to taxation; - our ability to realize the full value of goodwill; - the fact that the interests of our principal shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of holders of Notes; - our significant leverage, which may make it difficult to operate our businesses; - the covenants contained in the Indentures and our Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, which limit our operating and financial flexibility; - risks related to our indebtedness and the Notes; and - other factors discussed under “Risk Factors”.

We do not have any obligation to publicly revise any forward-looking statement to reflect circumstances or events after the date of such forward-looking statement or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events. In addition, from time to time we and our representatives, acting in respect of information provided by us, have made or may make forward-looking statements orally or in writing. These forward-looking statements may be included in, but are not limited to, press releases (including on our website), reports to our noteholders and other communications. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements referred to above and contained elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, including those set forth under the section entitled “Risk Factors.” The risks described in the “Risk Factors” section in this Offering Memorandum are not exhaustive. Other sections of this Offering Memorandum describe additional factors that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all such risk factors, nor can we assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements.

357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.1,Our Company,9.1.1,,"We are the leading retailer of frozen food products in France, based on sales, and are a pioneer in the sector. In calendar year 2020, we had an approximate 20.6% market share (including ice cream products) of the approximately €8.2 billion French frozen food market according to internal data and industry publications (prepared by Nielsen Retailers Panel and Syndigel). We offer our customers a total of approximately 1,250 different frozen food SKUs (or an average of approximately 1,000 SKUs per store), including unprocessed meat, fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables and bakery products, as well as a full range of ready-made starters, main courses, desserts and ice cream at various price points. We introduced the concept of premium quality, appetizing frozen food to French consumers when we opened our first store in Paris in 1974. Since then, we have continued to develop the market for frozen food products in France by transforming the way the French public perceives and consumes frozen food. We sell products under our own Picard brand (approximately 95% of our sales of frozen products during the year ended March 31, 2021), as well as under a few national and international brands, such as, for example, Häagen-Dazs, Charal and Ben & Jerry’s. In France, our Picard products are sold almost exclusively through our store network (including through our new Click & Collect program) as well as through Home Delivery, which extends throughout France due to our partnerships with courier companies, including “Chronofresh”, a Chronopost subsidiary. We have successfully expanded our network over the years, and we opened an average of 40 new stores per year from the year ended March 31, 2002 to the year ended March 31, 2012 and an average of 24 new stores per year from April 2012 to March 31, 2021 (either directly-operated stores or through franchises in France and abroad). As of March 31, 2021, we had 1,051 stores in France (including two franchised stores in Corsica, two franchised stores in the French West Indies, ten franchised stores in La Réunion, two franchised stores in New Caledonia and 22 franchised stores in mainland France), 14 stores in Belgium, 15 franchised stores in Japan, one store in Luxembourg and ten franchised stores in Scandinavia. We also sell our products abroad through various additional channels. For instance, we sell products in the United Kingdom through the grocery home delivery service Ocado and the grocery store Marks & Spencer and in Singapore through a partnership with RedMart. Additionally, through a partnership with Albert Heijn, a number of Picard products are offered in certain Albert Heijn supermarkets and hypermarkets in the Netherlands. Since August 2018, a joint venture partner has operated the network of stores in Sweden, which we previously owned, and also sells our products in ICA stores. We outsource the production of all of our products to approximately 260 different suppliers in calendar year 2020, allowing us to concentrate on quality control and new product research, development and innovation. We continuously review our product offering and introduce on average approximately 250 new SKUs a year. During the year ended March 31, 2021, we continued our innovation efforts and we introduced 287 new SKUs (representing approximately 23% of our 1,250 frozen food SKUs), including exclusive national brands and new SKUs for thematic campaigns. As a result of our innovation efforts, many of our products are unique to us, which we believe attracts customers to our stores. We have successfully increased our Total retail France sales over the last 10 years from €1,181.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2011 to €1,646.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% despite certain economic and industry challenges during that period. For the year ended March 31, 2021, sales in France, which include sales from our directly-operated stores as well as Home Delivery and sales to our franchisees located in mainland France, Corsica, the French West Indies, La Réunion and New Caledonia accounted for 97.6% of our total sales, with sales in Belgium, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Singapore and the United Kingdom generating the remaining balance. Our Total retail France sales were €1,646.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, increasing by 15.5% compared to the 1 ----- same period in the prior year, which was due, in part, to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on Nielsen data (including VAT) and their commercial calendar, we believe we outperformed the French frozen food market by approximately 600 basis points in the year ended March 31, 2021 (with our revenue growing by approximately 15.2%, as compared to market growth in the broader French frozen food market of approximately 8.8%).",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.1,"Strong, well-recognized brand in France that prioritizes the needs of our customers","_Picard is the leading brand in the French frozen food market and among the most widely recognized retail brands_ in France. Since 2011, Picard has consistently ranked among the retail banners most favored by French consumers. In 2018, the consulting firm EY-Parthenon published the results of a 8,500 consumer panel study in which it ranked Picard as its number one banner overall and, in 2019, OC&C ranked Picard the second most favorite retail banner of French consumers (ahead of other well-known and highly recognized retailers such as Sephora, Leroy Merlin, IKEA and Amazon). In 2021, a study conducted by Partoo on the online reputation of retailers based on online reviews and ratings of our stores revealed that Picard was the retailer with the highest rating (correlated to the number of reviews) with a rating of 4.3 out of 5. We believe that our leading brand position results from a combination of factors, including our reputation for quality and convenience, the range and diversity of our products and our national footprint of stores situated in high traffic areas. In addition, we constantly seek to innovate and maintain the relevance of our product range. For example, in recent years, we have increasingly focused on healthy and natural products, including our low-fat products, comprising the “+ d’équilibre” line of low-fat meals. In 2020, we accelerated the development of our healthy offerings with the launch of a new range of products from farms that are in the process of being designated as “organic” and the development of vegetarian and vegan products (new vegan product line). Between calendar years 2005 and 2020, we increased the number of organic product SKUs from 14 to 114 units, representing respectively 1.2% and 7.9% of our SKUs. Over the same period, as a percentage of sales of goods, sales of organic products also increased from 1.2% in calendar year 2005 to 7.4% in calendar year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, we introduced 28 new organic product SKUs (excluding wines), in line with our plan to continuously improve our product offerings. We continuously strive to make our prepared meals as balanced and healthy as possible, including reducing the levels of salt, saturated fat and hidden sugars. We endeavor to ensure that none of our products contains genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”), artificial colorings, hydrogenated fats or other harmful additives. We emphasize local products, with at least 70% of our products made in France and 90% of our unprocessed meat and 100% of beef in all our products coming from animals reared in France. We also prioritize sustainably sourced seafood, with 53 MSC labeled products and 21 ASC labeled products, as of March 31, 2021. Moreover, we have devised various niche ranges to meet the specific needs of some of our customers such as gluten-free products or products designed for lacto-ovo-vegetarians, including our range of “Tout bon tout veggie” products. We intend to offer a broad product range to reach as broad a customer base as possible. For example, we have designed a range of products intended to meet the needs of our customers who are looking for a quick, tasty and nutritious prepared meal that is specifically designed for one person and is affordable; the “Formule Express” is priced at between €2.00 and €3.00 per unit, which tends to be very popular amongst our customers. We have also designed the range “Bons petits plats”, a selection of high-quality individual meals with a higher price point. Our strong brand recognition and the fact that consumers associate our food with nutrition, healthy eating, authenticity and taste are key drivers of consumer interest in our products, visits to our stores and our ability to generate high sales volumes and attractive margins. The appeal and high-quality of our product offering is highlighted by one of our aspiring taglines “For better and for best” (“Pour le bon et le meilleur”). Our strong brand recognition also provides us with a solid platform to further expand both our retail network of stores and digital offering through Home Delivery and Click & Collect.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.2,Wide range of premium quality products and innovative offerings,"We offer customers a total of approximately 1,250 quality SKUs across our store network (or an average of approximately 1,000 SKUs per store) ranging from unprocessed meat, fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables and bakery products, as well as a full range of prepared starters, main courses, desserts and ice cream. 95% of these SKUs are sold under Picard’s own brand. We offer a wide range of prepared meals, including traditional French meals, international food, gourmet products and special occasion products. In addition, we offer a range of 2 ----- seasonal products throughout the year. We believe we offer the best value for money in comparison to our competitors. We provide a large selection of products at a variety of price points within each of our product categories, enabling us to capture a broader spectrum of consumers. We believe that the breadth of our product range constitutes a significant barrier to entry. We estimate that our product range is approximately two times that of the frozen food range generally stocked by grocers and approximately four times that of the range generally stocked by convenience stores and hard discounters. Given the breadth and quality of our customer proposition, and a wide and constantly renewed product offering, which also includes snacks, we believe that we compete not only in the frozen food category but more widely for a share in other markets such as the bakery market and consequently see further growth potential for our business. Many of our products are unique to Picard, which we believe attracts customers to our stores. In addition, our R&D staff benefits from close relationships with our suppliers, who frequently propose new products to us on an exclusive basis, which enables us to maintain a competitive edge. We introduce on average approximately 250 new SKUs per year and we continuously review, update and replace our products to ensure that we always offer our customers innovative and interesting choices. Over the past few years, we have increased our efforts to offer innovative products to our customers, with regular new product launches. In total, we introduced approximately 287 new SKUs during the year ended March 31, 2021. We believe that being a leader in innovation allows us to foster our existing customers’ loyalty by keeping customers interested in our product offerings over time. Additionally, while frozen food remains our established core business, which we have cultivated over more than 40 years, we also offer our customers a variety of non-frozen quality food and gourmet products. For example, we have a fast growing range of grocery products and a selection of wines and champagne. We have also developed new concepts aimed at increasing brand awareness and attracting new customers. Our experience leads us to believe that our commitment to innovation, our expertise and our ability to create new products each year is unmatched.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.3,Leading market position and extensive store network in France,"We believe that we have been the leading retailer of frozen food products, by sales, in France since 1999. We more than doubled our market share (including ice cream) from approximately 9% in 2000 to approximately 20.6% in 2020, and believe that we have been instrumental in influencing the consumption habits of French consumers toward frozen food, helping to drive the growth of the market with our innovation and commitment to quality. Our market position is supported by our extensive store network, which consists of 1,013 directlyoperated stores in France as of March 31, 2021 (along with 22 franchised stores in mainland France, two franchised stores in Corsica, ten franchised stores in La Réunion, two franchised stores in the French West Indies and two franchised stores in New Caledonia). Due to our extensive experience, and the great care we take, in opening stores, we have been successful at identifying attractive locations. We believe that our store portfolio has a remarkably homogenous performance and we have rarely closed stores (only 17 in the past two decades in France). Even during a global pandemic, we were able to open 17 new stores in mainland France in the year ended March 31, 2021 (14 directly-owned stores and three franchised stores). We believe that our extensive, high-quality network of retail stores in France positions us favorably in comparison to our competitors that do not have such an extensive network and also represents a significant barrier to entry to other competitors.

While we have long-standing relationships with many of our suppliers, we believe we are not dependent on any one supplier and have the flexibility to change or add new suppliers if needed. In the 2020 calendar year, our largest supplier represented approximately 5.8% of our purchases by value, our five largest suppliers represented 22.4% of our purchases by value, our 10 largest suppliers represented 33.7% of our purchases by value and our 20 largest suppliers represented 50.1% of our purchases by value. We have stable and long-standing relationships with the majority of our main suppliers, and the terms of our supply agreements allow for significant flexibility, which is essential to our ability to make production changes quickly and efficiently. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe our relationships with our suppliers have enabled us to increase volumes in response to increased demand. In addition, all of our logistics, including all eight of our warehouses, are outsourced. In 2020, we were able to adapt and increase the number of warehouses that service our Home Delivery channel from two to three in order to meet the increased demand for Home Delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 31, 2021, approximately 89% of our stores in mainland France were leased pursuant to “commercial leases”, which grant significant rights under French law to lessees compared to leases in many other jurisdictions. We believe that our business model affords us significant flexibility and ability to expand, particularly given the modest capital expenditures required to expand our store network, allowing management to focus on the higher value-added aspects of our business, such as reviewing our product range and keeping operating costs under control.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.5,"Stable, cash-generative and high-margin business with a deleveraging track record","The following chart shows Picard’s revenue (including VAT) in France from the calendar year 1986 to 2020: In € millions 1,682 1,429 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 Gross profit as a percentage of sales of goods has remained stable in recent years, amounting to 43.9% for the year ended March 31, 2019, 43.8% for the year ended March 31, 2020 and 43.7% for the year ended March 31, 2021, which we believe is among the highest gross margin rates in the food retail industry, reflecting our strong brand recognition, favorable pricing arrangements with our suppliers and what we believe to be our ability to pass through commodity price increases to our customers. Furthermore, our revenue has grown every year since 1986, demonstrating the long-term stability of our business, with the exception of fiscal years 2014 and 2019 (with the revenue decline in fiscal year 2014 mainly due to an industry-wide incident in France concerning the discovery of horsemeat in prepared meals, including two of our prepared beef products, and the revenue decline in fiscal year 2019 mainly due to the political context in France as our results were negatively impacted by the “Yellow Vest” protests in France which peaked during our traditionally busiest period and, at times, restricted physical access to our stores). Our business also benefits from relatively low capital expenditure requirements, which is supported by the fact that our standardized store format allows for cost-efficient store openings and maintenance. 4 ----- Our total capital expenditures represented 2.5%, 3.1% and 2.8% of our sales of goods for the years ended March 31, 2019, March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, respectively. In the year ended March 31, 2021, 11.7% of our capital expenditures were related to new store openings. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditures”. In_ addition, our working capital is structurally negative, meaning that our working capital requirements tend to generate a cash inflow as we grow the business. Our strong margins, favorable working capital structure and low capital expenditure requirements have allowed us to generate significant cash flow even during the economic downturn and resulted in an EBITDA to cash-flow conversion rate of 81.0%, 70.3%, 95.0% and 93.3% for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, with an average of 84.9% over the last four fiscal years. This has allowed us to reduce our financial leverage, in terms of net debt to EBITDA (on a pre-IFRS 16 basis), from 7.0x as of March 31, 2018 to 4.3x as of March 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.6,Attractive and resilient market,"Between calendar years 2000 and 2019, we estimate that the French frozen food market for at-home consumption grew by approximately 30%, from approximately €5.6 billion in 2000 to approximately €7.3 billion (including VAT) in 2019 (including convenience and drive/e-commerce). During the same period, our sales in France grew from approximately €532 million in 2000 to €1,429 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 (including VAT). For the calendar year 2020, we estimate that the French frozen food market for at-home consumption grew by approximately 12.3%, from approximately €7.3 billion in 2019 to approximately €8.2 billion (including VAT) in 2020 (including convenience and drive/e-commerce), which is largely attributable to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the same period, our sales in France grew from €1,429 million in 2019 to €1,682 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (including VAT), mainly due to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The French food market has historically remained resilient in challenging low-growth economic conditions and we believe market growth has been driven by favorable demographic and sociological trends, such as increases in the number of single-parent families, single-person households and women in full-time employment, decreases in the amount of time allocated each day to the preparation of meals and an increasing focus on healthy food. Frozen food products offer nutritional quality and taste similar to that of fresh food and retain nutrients and vitamins longer through deep freezing. In addition, our target market extends beyond the frozen food segment into the much larger packaged and chilled food sectors, as we also compete against alternatives, such as fresh products from farmers’ markets, traditional bakeries and butcher shops and upscale delicatessens. We believe that French consumers increasingly accept frozen food made from quality ingredients as a healthy, tasty and convenient alternative to fresh food products. In addition, we believe that customers are increasingly conscious of the fact that frozen food limits food waste as customers can use portions as needed. We believe that our ability to create and embrace new trends in the food market will allow us to continue to consolidate our leadership position, which we believe will be essential as the French frozen food market matures. For example, our wines and champagnes have been a source of growth in our dry products category, and complement our frozen food offering. As of March 31, 2021, our wine and champagne selection was available in 907 stores. Other trends (such as the increasing market share of organic products) and new consumption patterns also constitute opportunities for us to increase our sales and generate growth. Based on Nielsen data (including VAT) and their commercial calendar, we believe we outperformed the French frozen food market by approximately 600 basis points and the overall food market by approximately 1,100 basis points in the year ended March 31, 2021 (with our revenue growing by approximately 15.2%, as compared to market growth in the broader French frozen food market of approximately 8.8% and the overall food market of approximately 4.4%).",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The team is led by our Chief Executive Officer Cathy Collart-Geiger. Cathy joined Picard in June 2020 and has 27 years of professional experience in the retail industry and is supported by our Chief Financial Officer, Guillaume Degauque, who joined Picard in 2014, and by the other members of our senior management team, some of whom have been with us for more than 20 years. We believe that the collective industry knowledge and leadership of our senior management team and their record of accomplishment in responding to challenging economic conditions and achieving profitable sales growth will enable us to continue to deliver strong financial results in the future. 5 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.2,Our Competitive Strengths,9.2.8,,We believe that our unique position in the frozen food market as both a developer of premium quality products and a retailer results from the following key strengths:,N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.1,Optimize like-for-like sales performance,"Historically, we have had robust like-for-like sales growth and plan to increase our like-for-like sales growth with a data-driven, customer-oriented commercial strategy, optimized product offerings and improved store concepts. We regularly introduce new, complementary products to seek to increase our customers’ average basket size and number of tickets. We also intend to improve sales to our existing customer base by amending and updating our CRM program “Picard & Moi”, launched in 2017. Our aim is to make shopping with Picard a part of our customers’ daily lives. We believe that our customers have been particularly attracted to the convenience and premium quality of our offering during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the closure of restaurants and workplace cafeterias during lockdowns and the related increase in at-home consumption (even outside of lockdown periods). We believe many of our existing customers have discovered additional products among our offering (with higher average baskets driven by both average price unit and number of SKUs in the basket, including between lockdowns) and many new customers have been introduced to Picard. For example, approximately 300,000 active new members (net of inactive customers) joined our customer loyalty program, “Picard & moi”, in 2020. Going forward, we aim to maintain a higher average basket (compared to pre-pandemic periods), retain new customers even after the pandemic has ended and attract new customers, particularly younger customers. We initiated the reinforcement of our CRM program during the year 2020 and created a new department in charge of Brand, Digital & Customer Experience under the supervision of Emmanuelle Bach Donnard, a key executive who joined our management team in 2020. In addition, in January 2021, we hired a new CRM manager to assist us with further developing our CRM program, which we have been developing since 2015. We plan to maintain our commitment to offering customers a wide range of premium quality products at a variety of price points while continuing to develop innovative products that are unique to Picard. Our organic offerings are one of the categories that we believe have attracted new customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we intend to continue providing new healthy and organic products. Going forward, we also intend to adapt our product offerings based on store type and geography to maximize sales. We also plan to continue investing in our internal research capabilities and our staff and developing long-term partnerships with leading suppliers. Additionally, we seek to provide our customers with a superior retail shopping experience by remodeling our stores when necessary. In 2020, Picard was ranked first for client experience in its stores by dunnhumby, a customer data science specialist, in its study Retailer Preference Index. We believe that the remodeling of our stores increases traffic by creating a more modern and attractive environment and generates sales growth. In the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, we remodeled 81 and 61 stores, respectively. Going forward, we plan to continue to improve our store concept “Vision” and expect to accelerate the remodeling of our stores to enhance the customers’ experience in-store, with an anticipated average remodeling rate of approximately 140 stores per year (provided that the results from remodeled stores indicate that such remodeling is effective). We seek to continue improving our sales performance by focusing on our customer base, the products we offer and the environment we create.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.2,Expand our store footprint in France and internationally,"We believe that, over time, there is the potential to continue our successful expansion strategy in France with the opening of additional directly-operated stores in large and medium cities and complementary franchised stores in smaller cities. We estimate that there is the potential to open approximately 200 more stores in France. In particular, we believe that our plan to further expand our franchised store model, after five years of successful implementation in mainland France, will increase our local presence in smaller cities and brand awareness, while helping us negotiate better terms with our suppliers through increased volumes, with no or limited additional capital expenditures. As of March 31, 2021, we sell our products through 22 franchised stores in smaller cities in mainland France. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen an increase in the amount of inbound interest from potential franchisees in opening franchised stores. In addition, we believe we can grow our current network of 1,013 directly-operated retail stores in mainland France as of March 31, 2021, without meaningful adverse effects on our average sales per store. Most of our stores are located in or near city centers and metropolitan areas. We monitor the cannibalization of sales in surrounding stores following the opening of a new store and have not noticed any material increase in cannibalization in the past few years. We believe that a higher density of stores will contribute to top-of-mind awareness for customers and support store visit frequency. 6 ----- Our management team identifies potential directly-operated and franchised store sites based on demographics, the availability of suitable retail space, local economic conditions and other factors that we believe are relevant to the successful expansion of our store network and that should enable us to capitalize on the anticipated increased traffic and sales volume of our new stores. We believe that our new stores will benefit from strong brand awareness and existing marketing campaigns, and consequently require only limited incremental marketing support. We also plan to further expand our existing network of stores and explore strategic alternatives to further develop our presence outside of mainland France and internationally, including through franchising arrangements and new partnerships. Our international presence primarily consists of directly-operated stores in Belgium and Luxembourg, and franchised stores in Scandinavia and Japan. In the year ended March 31, 2021, we opened three franchised stores in mainland France, two franchised stores in Ile de la Réunion and two franchised stores in New Caledonia. Thus far, the results of these franchised stores have been promising. We intend to continue our expansion in Belgium (having opened one additional store in Namur in May 2021) and in Japan, as well as exploring opportunities to expand into new countries and regions. In particular, we are focusing on forming partnerships that allow us to access smaller markets that may not support a large Picard presence. These partnerships allow us to understand and evaluate a local market for any franchising potential, while limiting our risk. Following the divestment of our Italian subsidiary in May 2015, we entered into a commercial agreement with a local partner, allowing us to maintain our presence in Italy; our partner sells Picard products in its stores. Since January 2018, a number of Picard products are offered in Albert Heijn supermarkets and hypermarkets in the Netherlands, as well as through their website. In August 2018, we sold our Swedish operations to our jointventure partner and entered into a five-year franchisee agreement, whereby the franchisee continues to sell our products in Sweden, including through corners with a leading Swedish supermarket, ICA. In January 2020, we extended our activities in Singapore through a partnership with Redmart. In addition, we have entered into commercial partnerships in the United Kingdom with the grocery home delivery service Ocado beginning in 2016 and the food store Marks & Spencer beginning in July 2020. We continue to look for strategic alternatives to develop our international markets. Our international operations (consisting of sales in Belgium, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Singapore and the United Kingdom) accounted for 2.4% of our sales for the year ended March 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.3,Capture market share in growing channels such as digital,"During the year ended March 31, 2020, our Home Delivery sales amounted to €31.5 million (or 2.1% of our total sales), an increase of €2.8 million, or 9.6%, from €28.8 million in the previous year. Over the same period, the number of online orders increased by approximately 14%. During the year ended March 31, 2021, our Home Delivery sales amounted to €58.9 million (or 3.3% of our total sales), an increase of €27.4 million, or 86.7%, from €31.5 million in the previous year due, in part, to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the same period, the number of online orders increased by approximately 104.1% also due, in part, to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that current trends and the growth observed in our Home Delivery channel show a successful shift towards the digital channel (in addition to the positive impact on this channel due to the COVID-19 pandemic), a distribution channel that is complementary to our network of ‘brick-and-mortar’ stores and adapts to the preferences of our younger customers. In addition, we believe that customers using multiple channels have a stronger loyalty to the brand and that their total annual expenditure at Picard is higher than other customers. Further increasing our online sales will enable us to capture an additional segment of the market, including customers in areas with little store presence, and supplement visits to our stores by offering consumers an additional and convenient channel. Following the launch of our new website in June 2020, we intend to make continuing improvements to our website in order to maintain and increase our online sales. We have also developed a “Picard app” for smartphones, which offers numerous services to our customers, including the ability to order through Home Delivery since January 2016, and we are planning to launch an updated app, which is more user-friendly and better designed for mobile phones, in the second half of calendar year 2021 to replace the existing app. In addition to developing and improving high-quality digital tools, we have also improved our overall Home Delivery offering with the expansion of delivery times to better match customers’ needs, the creation of additional services and a focus on faster response times and quicker deliveries. We were able to capture the increased demand for home deliveries resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic with a quick response, including having a third warehouse equipped for Home Delivery and partnering with courier companies, including “Chronofresh”, a Chronopost subsidiary, in late November 2020. We plan to further explore potential 7 ----- collaborations with third parties that may have the infrastructure to assist with ‘last mile’ home deliveries and allow us to expand our reach of Home Delivery across France. We also launched our new Click & Collect program in late November 2020, which contributed an additional €0.8 million of sales over the test period in a limited number of stores at Christmas and we plan to extend that service to most of our stores in 2021. In addition, we have recently launched frozen food vending machines, offering a selected range of products at convenient locations, such as corporate workplaces and schools; this concept was launched at 25 sites during its first year in 2020, despite the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are also exploring options for further diversification, including the potential for developing partnerships in commercial catering.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.4,Improve brand recognition among our customers,"_Picard has a strong history of brand recognition in France. For the past four years, Picard has ranked in the_ top five for “retail brand attractiveness in France”. Going forward, we plan to continue developing our brand with a focus on our role as a retailer, an employer and a ‘corporate citizen’. We have recently hired a new Head of Communications and a new Marketing Director, and expect them to help us to optimize the performance of our marketing campaigns and maximize the return on investment in our communication strategy. We intend to focus on developing a coherent brand identity across all channels: in-store and on social media. In March 2021, we launched our new brand platform, which emphasizes the advantages of frozen foods and the quality of Picard products through billboards, radio advertisements, social media advertisements and television adverts. Over the next two years, we plan to increase our marketing budget to enable us to launch campaigns targeted at new customers (for example, younger customers and customers outside of Paris and Ile-de-France (the area in and around Paris)) and emphasizing our most appealing offerings (for example, our organic and healthy food offerings and our value for money offerings).",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.3,Our Strategy,9.3.5,Continue our commitment to sustainability and focus on improving our ESG performance,"Picard has implemented a clear governance structure with responsibility to ensure our operations are aligned to our sustainability priorities. We have a Quality and Sustainable Development director who reports directly to the company CEO, and supervises a dedicated ESG team comprising four full-time staff as well as regular committees across various departments, including our human resources, technical support teams, and supply chain departments, to follow and ensure implementation of our various action plans. Our annual key performance indicators for corporate social responsibility are monitored and collected across the relevant operational divisions, with internal compliance controls to ensure the consistency with our historical figures. We intend to strengthen our brand by continuing and increasing our commitment to organic foods and sustainable sourcing, in order to meet both consumers’ expectations and emerging environmental concerns, such as overfishing and large-scale industrial agriculture. Since we launched our first organic products in 1998, we have expanded the number of organic products we offer to 120 SKUs in the year ended March 31, 2021. In addition to increasing the number and broadening the selection of organic products, we have improved the visibility of such products in-store with dedicated freezer compartments and an easily identifiable trademark for our organic products (“Le Bio par Picard”). Our other commitments for more responsible consumption include focusing on animal welfare (for example, by aiming to have all our egg-based products made from cage-free eggs by 2025), sustainable farming and fishing (for example, by prioritizing products made in France when possible as well as seafood and fish products with a third-party sustainability certification), locally sourced products (for example, by ensuring 70% of our products are made in France and 90% of our unprocessed meat (and 100% of beef in our products) comes from animals reared in France), and healthy eating (for example, by reducing the levels of salt, saturated fat and hidden sugars). We are also committed to improving our ESG performance in other ways that are meaningful to our business and stakeholders. For example, at the beginning of 2020, Picard committed to reducing our plastic packaging by reducing both the thickness of packaging and by replacing plastic with other materials. The work of our product development teams has enabled us to reduce the plastic used in our packaging by 325 tonnes in calendar year 2020, a 4% reduction as compared to calendar years 2018 and 2019 despite increases in volumes sold. We are aiming to use 100% recyclable plastic by 2025 (compared with 71% today). We are continuing to prioritize the energy efficiency of our business operations with a focus on using renewable energy with 100% of the energy consumed in our stores coming from renewable sources. In accordance with our newly-established 8 ----- Sustainability Performance Targets, we aim to reduce the energy consumption by our stores by 6% by 2023 (compared to our 2020 baseline) and to reduce carbon emissions from our shipping networks and logistics chains by 10% by 2023 (compared to our 2019 baseline). Finally, we are committed to improving the well-being of our employees and supporting diversity and inclusion among our workforce. Around 70% of our workforce is made up of women and we have scored 94 out of 100 in the gender equality index established by the French government. We also employ dedicated Disability Project Managers to assist our disabled employees. We plan to continue to strive to provide more advanced equipment to our employees to minimize strenuous tasks and improve safety, as well as developing remote work policies to accommodate special employee situations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2018, we entered into an agreement on equality and quality of life at work, which was signed by all trade unions of which our employees are members; this agreement has a four-year term, and reinforces our corporate policies, including with respect to equality during the recruitment process and better integration of employees with disabilities. In January 2021, the association “Génération Responsable,” which promotes sustainable development in the retail sector, awarded Picard with the sustainability development label of “responsible brand” (“Enseigne _Responsable”), created to promote companies who have structured and integrated ESG features as part of their_ global strategy.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

357,Offerings 2021.md,9,SUMMARY,9.10,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; illustrative Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA,9.10.1,,"Our performance has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis has had a positive impact on the frozen food market, frozen food being considered as both safer and more convenient in such period. In addition, customers have tended to avoid hypermarkets to shop in smaller stores, closer to their houses and with fewer social interactions. Finally, the food retail sector has benefitted from the closure of restaurants, workplace cafeterias and other out-of-home food services during lockdown periods. These trends have clearly benefitted our business. We estimate that the positive impact of the pandemic on our turnover for the year ended March 31, 2020 was approximately €35 million and such positive effect has since then continued and significantly affected our turnover for the year ended March 31, 2021. However, the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a negative impact on our results of operations, as compared to our results of operations during the course of the pandemic. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered an economic recession in France and creates much uncertainty regarding economic and social conditions for future periods both in France and the other markets in which we operate. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our _Business—The end of the COVID-19 pandemic and other developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our business”._ 11 ----- To illustrate the potential impact of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, we present below illustrative Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA using two different methods and applying certain assumptions: - _Illustration based on market normalization. In the first method, we have considered (i) an increase of approximately 3% in the French market for frozen food to €7.6 billion (compared to €7.3 billion in calendar year 2019, but below the €8.2 billion in calendar year 2020) due to lasting changes in consumer habits following the pandemic, such as increased working from home and the rediscovery of the convenience and value of frozen foods and (ii) a 0.35% market share gain to 20.9% from our 2020 market share of 20.6% (representing half of share gain achieved in 2020 and in line with prior annual share gains). Applying these assumptions, we estimate that our illustrative Normalized Sales would amount to approximately €1,623 million (approximately €1,580 million in France and approximately €43 million internationally). We have then applied an EBITDA margin (EBITDA as a percentage of total sales) based on an interpolation of the historical EBITDA margins for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 at this illustrative sales level. For the resulting Normalized Sales figure, this implies an EBITDA margin of 14.1% and a Normalized EBITDA (on a pre-IFRS 16 basis) of approximately €228 million (or approximately €291 million on a post-IFRS 16 basis). - _Illustration based on evolution of basket size and number of tickets. In the second method, we have considered (i) a 2.5% increase in the average basket size (compared to the year ended March 31, 2020, and compared to a 13.7% increase in the year ended March 31, 2021 and 9.3% increase following the easing of restrictions in May) reflecting both lasting changes in consumer habits following the pandemic and targeted new marketing initiatives and (ii) a 0.7% increase in the number of tickets (compared to the year ended March 31, 2020, and stable with the increase in the year ended March 31, 2021 and lower than the 12.3% increase following the easing of restrictions in May), reflecting the net new customers gained during the pandemic. Applying these assumptions, we estimate that our illustrative Normalized Sales would amount to approximately €1,613 million (approximately €1,472 million in like-for-like French stores sales and approximately €141 million from our other businesses, such as newly opened stores, Home Delivery, franchises and international activity). Normalized EBITDA has been calculated using the same methodology outlined above, which for the resulting Normalized Sales figure, implies an EBITDA margin of 14.0% and a Normalized EBITDA (on a preIFRS 16 basis) of approximately €226 million (or approximately €289 million on a post-IFRS 16 basis). Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA are non-IFRS measures that have been derived using various assumptions related to the impact of the end of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results. See “Risk Factors—Risks _Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Illustrative Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA presented in this Offering Memorandum should be treated with caution when making an investment decision”. Our illustrative_ Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA are calculated using the year ended March 31, 2020 as a reference year, given that the pandemic had only a small impact on that year’s results (as described above), and is estimated to have impacted EBITDA by a smaller amount given the additional expenses incurred at the beginning of the pandemic in March 2020. In particular, we have assumed that the market size in France will normalize from a COVID-19 peak but will nonetheless retain a portion of its growth during the pandemic, due to the change in consumer habits, and that we will slightly increase our market share, based on historical trends. In addition, we have assumed that results in our other businesses (including newly opened stores, Home Delivery, franchises and international activity) will remain stable as the reversion towards pre-COVID levels is offset by international expansion, new franchises and new store openings. We have assumed that the number of tickets will slightly increase, given the net new customers gained, and that a portion of the basket size increase is sustainable, given that customers have new cooking and consumption habits. These illustrations of Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA are not forecasts or estimates of our future results, but are merely illustrations of the possible movement in revenue and EBITDA under the assumptions discussed above. They do not take into account any other factors that could cause our results to vary from the illustrations, including the risk factors described under “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. Our actual results may differ considerably from those illustrated above. 12 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

357,Offerings 2021.md,90,SUMMARY HISTORICAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND OTHER DATA,90.20,,90.20.1,,"_The following tables present summary historical consolidated financial information and other information for the SN Issuer as of and for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The summary historical consolidated financial information of the SN Issuer as of and for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the SN Issuer as of and for the years ended March 31, 2021, 2020, 2019 and 2018 included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, unless otherwise stated. Since April 1, 2019, the Group has applied IFRS 16 in accordance with the modified retrospective approach. The application of this standard significantly increases the Group’s EBITDA. The Group has chosen to apply IFRS 16 using the simplified retrospective approach as of April 1, 2019 and the March 31, 2019 financial statements and the March 31, 2018 financial statements have consequently not been restated. Prior to the adoption of this standard, rent expenses were recorded in the line item “other purchases and external expenses”. Following the adoption of this new standard, the Group has recognized right-of-use assets for its eligible stores and vehicles, which are depreciated over the lease term, depreciation charges being recorded in the line item “depreciation and amortization” of the Group income statement, and a corresponding lease liability initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that have not been paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. As a result of the significant changes caused by the application of IFRS 16, the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for periods prior to the year ended March 31, 2020 may not be comparable to financial information for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021. In December 2019, the IFRS interpretation committee (“IFRS IC”) published its decision clarifying the rules for determining the term of leases within the scope of IFRS 16. The application of this IFRS IC interpretation is a change in accounting method requiring a retrospective calculation of the impacts as of April 1, 2019 (applying the same incremental borrowing rates table as the one initially used by the Group at the first-time application date, to the newly determined lease terms). The Group applied the IFRS IC interpretation relating to the assessment of leases with retroactive effect from April 1, 2019 and, consequently, in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, the comparative columns as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020 were recast (indicated as “restated”) to reflect a decision by the IFRS IC relating to the classification of leases under IFRS 16 (Leases). Therefore, the comparative financial information as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020 in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, is not directly comparable to the financial information in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020. The following tables should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalization”, “Selected Historical Financial Information”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Description of the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes”, “Description of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes”, “Description of the Senior Notes” and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._ 26 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.1,The end of the COVID-19 pandemic and other developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our business.,"When the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, we expect that our sales and results of operations will be negatively affected by the re-opening of restaurants and workplace cafeterias and a reversal of the current trend towards increased at-home consumption, and such impact could be material. Any related decrease in our EBITDA as the COVID-19 pandemic subsides will result in an increase to our leverage. See “Risks Related to _Our Indebtedness and the Notes—Our significant leverage may make it difficult for us to operate our businesses”_ and “—We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, including the Notes, including _due to factors outside our control, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, including the Notes, which may not be successful.” In addition, costs incurred adapting our_ business and expanding Home Delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic may not be recoverable. While the COVID-19 pandemic had a positive impact on our sales and results of operations in the fiscal year ended March 31, 2021, there is no assurance that such impact will continue to be positive in future periods. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an economic recession in France and creates much uncertainty regarding economic and social conditions for future periods both in France and the other markets in which we operate. Any deterioration in the economic and social environment could negatively impact the ability of our customers to afford our premium products and lead to increased competition from hard discounters. See “—The market for our products is highly competitive, and we may not continue to compete effectively”. In addition, any continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in disruptions to our supply chain and product shortages in our stores. For example, certain of our suppliers that also supply restaurants have been negatively affected by the pandemic and we have from time-to-time agreed to shorter payment terms in order to support our suppliers. Any widespread outbreak among our employees, or any outbreak affecting members of key management, could negatively affect our operations. If our employees or customers were to allege that our failure to implement proper hygiene standards led to them contracting COVID-19, we could face increased litigation risk exposure and we have not made any provision for such risks. Further, we may incur increased costs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including costs relating to protecting our employees and customers and adapting our stores and services in response to concerns around social distancing. Any of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.1,Risks Related to Our Business,13.1.2,We are dependent on third-party suppliers to produce our products.,"We rely on third-party suppliers for all of our products, which exposes us to risks that such suppliers may fail to meet timelines, provide us with sufficient products or comply with our specifications. We require our suppliers to meet certain specifications and standards to ensure the high quality of our products. The use of thirdparty suppliers increases the demands on our quality control personnel and exposes us to risks that the products provided by our suppliers may not meet the relevant quality standards. For example, in February 2013, we, along with other retailers involved in the distribution of prepared meals, discovered that two of our beef prepared products contained horsemeat. The meat used by one of our suppliers for the preparation of these two products had been sourced from a meat supplier not pre-approved by us, in violation of our contractual specifications. In response, we removed those products from our stores and took measures to increase monitoring of our third-party 31 ----- suppliers, such as reinforcing our audit program to ensure strict compliance with our specifications, in particular by ensuring that ingredients are correctly pre-validated by our quality service (in terms of quality and origin) as well as systematically performing DNA tests (Polymerase Chain Reaction) to identify species on all our beef products. In addition, we have established a reinforced control plan on our seafood, fish and other meat products, including performing DNA tests (Polymerase Chain Reaction) to identify species of certain fish products. Despite the measures taken in response to the above-mentioned incident, it resulted in decreased traffic to our stores and had an adverse effect on our business, with our French stores’ like-for-like sales performance for the year that followed the incident being significantly lower than in the previous year. There can be no assurance that similar incidents will not occur in the future. Any similar incident or event that may occur in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, we believe that there are a limited number of competent, high-quality third-party suppliers in the industry, and if we were required to obtain additional or alternative agreements or arrangements in the future with third-party suppliers, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner or at all. This could limit our ability to implement our business plan or meet customer demand.

We sell food products for human consumption, which exposes us to safety risks such as product contamination, spoilage, misbranding or product tampering. Product contamination (including the presence of a foreign object, substance, chemical or other agent or residue or the introduction of a genetically modified organism), spoilage, misbranding or product tampering could require product withdrawals or recalls or destruction of inventory and could result in negative publicity, temporary warehouse closures and substantial costs of compliance or remediation. We may be impacted by publicity regarding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury. We could also be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness stemming from product contamination or any other incidents that compromise the safety and quality of our products. A significant lawsuit or widespread product recall or other events leading to the loss of consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our products could damage our brand, reputation and image and negatively impact our sales, profitability and prospects for growth. We strive to control the risks related to product quality and safety through the implementation of, and strict adherence to, our quality standards. We maintain systems designed to monitor food safety risks and require our suppliers to do so as well. However, we cannot guarantee that our efforts will be successful or that such risks will not materialize. In addition, even if our own products are not affected by contamination or other incidents that compromise their safety and quality, negative publicity about our industry, our ingredients or the health implications of frozen food products could result in reduced consumer demand for our products. For example, in 2013, a laboratory appointed by the Italian food safety authorities allegedly found that one of our products, a red berry mix, contained traces of Hepatitis A, as part of a wider European contamination of certain red berry products. We contested the findings of the analysis in question, based on the results of our own tests conducted in public and private laboratories. As a result, in December 2015, the investigation opened by the Italian Public Prosecutor in Torino, Italy, was closed. However, following the allegations of contamination, we carried out a product recall of the implicated products. More recently, starting in September 2020, certain products containing sesame seeds have been recalled by food retailers across the food industry in Europe, including Picard, after it was discovered that various lots of sesame seeds from India did not meet European Union food safety standards due to containing traces of the unauthorized substance ethylene oxide in excess of the residue limit permitted in the European Union. As a result of this incident, Picard has incurred additional costs at our customer service call center, as well as additional logistic costs and reimbursements. Starting in June 2021, similar contaminations of guar gum, an ingredient used in ice cream and mainly produced in India, led to a European-wide product recall affecting nine of our SKUs. While limited publicity arose as a result of these incidents and all three incidents were part of a broader industry-wide contamination, future allegations of a similar nature could have a more significant and material adverse effect on our reputation. We are also subject to risks affecting the food industry generally, including risks posed by widespread contamination and evolving nutritional and health-related concerns. Regulatory authorities may limit the supply 32 ----- of certain types of food products in response to public health concerns, and consumers may perceive certain products to be unsafe or unhealthy, which could require us or our suppliers to find alternative supplies or ingredients that may not be available at commercially reasonable prices or within acceptable time constraints. In addition, such governmental regulations may require us to identify replacement products for our customers or, alternatively, to discontinue certain offerings or limit the range of product offerings. We may be unable to find substitutes that are as appealing to our customers, or such substitutes may not be widely available or may be available only at increased costs. Such substitutions or limitations could also reduce demand for our products. Furthermore, consumers have been increasingly focused on food safety, health and wellness with respect to the food products they buy and their ingredients. Demand for our products could be affected by consumer concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients such as trans fats, sugar, processed wheat or other product attributes. Any claims, lawsuits or negative publicity related to the healthiness, safety and quality of our products may damage our reputation, increase our costs of operations and negatively impact demand for our products.

Our competitors include distributors, retailers and, to a lesser extent, large manufacturers of frozen food, but also distributors and retailers of fresh products, baked goods and chilled, ready-made meals. These other competitors include generalist grocers, supermarket chains, hard discounters, specialists (including home delivery distributors) and convenience stores. In recent years, we have observed an increase in the activity of hard discounters and online food retailers, in particular as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our competitors generally compete with us on the basis of location, quality of products, service, price, product variety and store condition. While we believe that we have developed a unique position in the French frozen food market as both a developer and a distributor of premium quality, competitively-priced frozen food products, there can be no assurance that we can successfully compete with those actors or that new competitors will not enter the industry. In recent years, generalist grocers and supermarkets have begun offering lines of frozen food products similar to our own, which has resulted in increased competition. Over the past few years, an increasing number of French distributors have opened local convenience stores which compete with us on the basis of location (by aiming to meet the needs of local customers), price (by charging low prices) and market positioning (by targeting the “everyday shopping” segment). In addition, some of our competitors have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than our own, creating competitive pressures that could cause us to lose market share and may require us to lower prices, to increase capital, marketing and advertising expenditures or to increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns, and may also restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other cost increases. These competitors could also be more efficient in developing their online and digital presence and may benefit from offering a wider selection of products (both frozen and unfrozen).

These ingredients and materials are subject to fluctuations in availability and price. Such fluctuations are attributable to, among other things, changes in supply and demand for crops or other commodities, energy prices, and government-sponsored agricultural and livestock programs. In particular, the availability and the price of vegetables and other commodities, including meat and fish, can be volatile. General economic conditions, unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, natural disasters, weather conditions during the growing and harvesting seasons, plant and livestock diseases and local, national or international quarantines can also adversely affect availability and prices of commodities in the long and short terms. In the future, we may be affected by the imposition of national or international quotas regulating, for example, volumes of raw materials, especially on fish and seafood products. If the French government or any other regulatory body establishes such measures, the price of raw materials could increase, and our gross margins would be affected. While we generally have long-term relationships with our suppliers, and alternate suppliers are generally available, we do not have long-term contracts with suppliers, and, as a result, our suppliers could increase the prices of their products or fail to deliver sufficient quantities to us. Although we attempt to reduce our exposure to price fluctuations to a limited extent by buying certain inventory at opportune moments during the year and holding it for sale until periods of high demand or shortages, our ability to avoid the adverse effects of a pronounced, sustained price increase in raw materials is limited. Increases in prices or scarcity of ingredients or packaging materials required for our products could increase our costs and disrupt our operations. In addition, our ability to pass along higher costs through price increases to our customers is dependent upon competitive pricing conditions in our industry. As a result, changes in our input costs could impact our gross margins. In addition, even if we are able to pass increased costs on to our customers, the higher prices of our products might lead to reduced consumer demand or negative changes in the product mix. In addition, significant amounts of electricity are needed to maintain our cold chain requirements for appropriate storage of materials and products before they are sold and we cannot guarantee that our electricity costs will not increase in the future. Since January 1, 2019, our electricity has been provided by Alterna pursuant to a two-year arrangement, which was renewed in March 2020 for an additional two-year period under the same contract terms. Under this contract, the price of electricity is not guaranteed and our electricity can be bought either through the mechanism of French regulated prices of nuclear energy (“arenh” -accès régulé à l’énergie _nucléaire historique) for certain volumes or directly on the market at spot prices. Volumes of electricity are_ bought in advance for predefined periods, generally between three months and twelve months, depending on the current price and the estimated market trends. The strong volatility recently observed in electricity prices can therefore negatively impact our cost structure. Moreover, taxes and distribution costs represent a significant amount of our total energy costs and they may increase during the contract period according to regulation and market condition and therefore lead to higher energy expenses. Finally, there can be no assurances that, upon the expiration or termination of our contract with Alterna, we will be able to secure a future arrangement with an energy provider on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our energy costs and taxes associated with energy costs may therefore increase following the expiration or termination of the contract with Alterna.

For example, our Home Delivery channel became increasingly popular during the COVID-19 pandemic, and our margin from our Home Delivery channel is lower than the margin from our in-store sales. Given the varied backgrounds and tastes of our customers, we must offer a sufficient range of products to satisfy a broad spectrum of preferences. We devote significant resources to developing and marketing new products and expanding and improving existing product lines, thus trying to predict and adapt to changes in consumer preferences. However, our efforts may not result in the volume of sales or profitability anticipated. Furthermore, our strategy seeks to appeal to a younger consumer base and to customers outside of Paris and Ile-de-France (the area in and around Paris) and we 34 ----- will need to anticipate their tastes and preferences. We also intend to adapt our product offerings based on store type and geography going forward. If we are unable to accurately predict, identify and interpret the changing tastes and dietary habits of consumers, or to accurately adapt our in-store offerings, our sales may decline and our operating results could suffer. In addition, as part of our strategy of developing our international markets, we offer our products in Belgium, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway, Singapore, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Consumer preferences in those markets and in markets into which we may expand in the future may differ from tastes and preferences of French consumers.

Many of our suppliers also carry out their own R&D and proactively propose new recipes and products to sell in our stores. We believe that continuously renewing our product offering is essential for keeping up with changes in the market and stimulating demand from both potential and existing customers. On average, we introduce approximately 250 new SKUs annually, including alternative flavors, sizes and packaging for our existing products. In calendar year 2020, the development of new SKUs was challenging due to lockdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic. If we are unable to continue developing an adequate range of new products, the attractiveness of our brand could be diminished and cause us to become less competitive.

These standards ensure the quality, freshness and safety of our products, and those characteristics are recognized by our customers and have become associated with our brand. We recently launched a new collaboration for our Home Delivery channel with “Chronofresh”, a Chronopost subsidiary, and our strategy includes exploring potential collaborations with other third parties that may have the infrastructure to assist with ‘last mile’ home deliveries. Such collaborations carry the risk that we may be negatively affected by any failure in the cold chain by such third parties.

We could be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to an actual or alleged illness, injury or death stemming from the consumption of one of our products which could negatively affect our business. For example, in 2020 Picard recalled a number of its products in the United Kingdom, Sweden and Belgium due to a mislabeling error, which led to allergens in those products not being listed on the label in the local language. While we are not currently the subject of any material product liability claims for damages as a result of the consumption or use of our products (including in connection with our mislabeled products as described above), and we submit our products to extensive testing, we may still be exposed to liability claims in the future. Awards of damages, settlement amounts and fees and expenses resulting from such claims and the public relations implications of any such claims could have an adverse effect on our business. The availability and price of insurance to cover claims for damages are subject to market forces that we do not control, and such insurance may be costly or inadequate and would not cover damage to our reputation. Even if product liability claims against us are not successful or fully pursued, these claims could be costly and time-consuming and may divert our management’s time and resources towards defending them rather than operating our business. Any adverse publicity related to such claims could result in loss of consumer confidence in the safety and quality of our products and damage our reputation and brand image.

We are thus particularly influenced by economic developments and changes in consumer habits in France, and a significant economic downturn in France could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, our more limited operations in Belgium, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and the United Kingdom expose us to economic trends in those regions as well. To the extent we extend our store network and commercial activities into other countries and territories, we will become exposed to economic trends in such countries and territories. Over the past decade, our business and the food retail industry as a whole were affected by the global economic crisis and by the effects on household consumption of the uncertainty and volatility resulting from the European sovereign debt crisis. While we believe that our business model has proven resilient throughout the economic crisis, we cannot predict whether it will continue to be successful in the future. In particular, we may not be able to achieve positive growth or, if we are able to do so, such growth may be low. For example, during calendar year 2019, France’s GDP growth reached 1.3% whereas our French like-for-like sales increased by 0.6% during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 due, in part, to the negative impact of the “Yellow Vest” protests, which began in 2018 and spread throughout France, causing severe disruption to our business due to specific instances of protests restricting physical access to our stores and the height of the protests occurring on Saturdays during the Christmas period, which are traditionally the busiest days in our most profitable period. While we seek to lessen the impact of the economic crises and resulting economic volatility through management of our selling prices, production costs, volumes, inventories and working capital, future changes in economic conditions in France, Belgium, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Singapore, Sweden and the United Kingdom, as well as globally, could result in short-term and long-term decreases in consumer confidence and demand, increases in selling prices and production costs, and volatility of raw material prices. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered an economic recession in France and creates much uncertainty regarding economic and social conditions for future periods both in France and the other markets in which we operate. See “—The end of the COVID-19 pandemic and other developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic could _negatively impact our business”._ In addition, our operations could be affected by political developments, including disturbances resulting from protests in the urban areas in which we operate, such as the anti-racism or “Yellow Vest” protests. More recently, in January 2021, we experienced Brexit-related delays with respect to importing our products to the United Kingdom and our contract with Marks & Spencer is temporarily suspended while we work to resolve Brexit-related complications. There is no guarantee that Brexit-related delays and complications will be resolved and any such complications could, if they continue, slow or lead to a cessation of our partnerships in the United Kingdom.

We believe that there remains potential to open stores during the next decade, based on our criteria for new openings and growth strategy, in line with historical expansion albeit at a slower pace. We intend to continue to expand our network of stores in the future based on our internally developed “geomarketing” analysis. In addition, we further extended our network using a franchise model in smaller cities in France and abroad to complement our directly-operated stores. Historically, the increase in the density of our network of stores in France has not materially affected our average sales per store; however, we cannot guarantee that opening additional stores will not adversely affect our existing stores through cannibalization or that our strategy of adding new stores to the network will continue to be profitable. While we have a history of managing our growth successfully, future business growth could place a significant strain on our managerial, operational and financial resources. Our ability to capitalize on future growth will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational, financial and information systems on a timely basis and to expand, train, motivate and manage our workforce. In addition, the increasing popularity of Home Delivery has required additional warehouse space. While to date we have been able to adapt our existing outsourced warehouses to respond to this need, as Home Delivery becomes more popular we expect we will require further capacity beyond that of our existing warehouses. Our personnel, systems, facilities, 36 ----- procedures and controls may not be adequate to support continued expansion, and failure to manage our expansion effectively may lead to increased costs, a decline in sales and reduced profitability.

For example, we opened two new franchised stores in Ile de la Réunion and two new franchised stores in New Caledonia during the fiscal year 2021. Following the divestment of our Italian subsidiary in May 2015, we entered into a commercial agreement with a local partner in order to maintain our presence in Italy. In August 2018, we sold our Swedish operations to our joint-venture partner and entered into a five-year franchisee agreement, whereby the franchisee will continue to sell our products in Sweden with a leading Swedish supermarket, ICA. Other commercial agreements have also been concluded with Aeon in Japan, Albert Heijn in the Netherlands, Ocado and Marks & Spencer in the United Kingdom and RedMart in Singapore. If we expand our overseas and international operations, including expanding into new countries and regions, we may encounter risks posed by, for example, the adaptation of our business model to non-French consumer preferences, different national or territorial health and consumer safety standards, a lack of local business experience and exposure to economic conditions in additional markets. We may also have difficulty hiring experts or qualified executives or employees in the countries and territories in which we plan to expand. Expansion requires significant start-up costs and we may also be unable to successfully integrate the services, products and personnel of any new stores we open or acquire into our operations, which may ultimately translate into a lack or absence of return on our investment. In addition, if our overseas and international expansion strategy proves to be inefficient, we may need to reduce the size of our store network and restructure our operations, which may also negatively impact our ability to generate profit in certain periods. For instance, in 2017, as a result of the poor performance of our stores in Sweden, we decided to close six stores in Sweden. In the year ended March 31, 2018, as we were closing our directly owned stores, we recorded a €0.8 million provision, in addition to the restructuring provision of €0.5 million relating to the first store which we had already recorded in March 2017. We fully depreciated the remaining fixed assets, bringing their value to nil. Ultimately, we decided to change the business model of our operations in Sweden and sold our Swedish operations to our joint-venture partner (which held 25% of our Picard Sweden AB subsidiary prior to the transaction) in August 2018 for a total consideration of €0.1 million. Also, we have in the past closed certain loss-making stores in Belgium (including two loss-making stores in Belgium in July 2018 and another lossmaking store in January 2020). Although the change in our business model is meant to maintain our presence locally while limiting losses and capital expenditure requirements and supporting our former partner in opening more stores and corners and developing partnerships with local retailers, our former partner may not be successful or may cease its affiliation with us. The unfamiliarity of local customers with frozen food products in any new country or territory that we enter or failure on our part to adapt our product offering to local tastes and preferences may also make it difficult for us to successfully implement our expansion plans. We may also encounter difficulties in our expansion due to the lack of, or difficulty in identifying, local partners and suppliers compatible with our flexible business model. We cannot guarantee that future efforts at expansion will be successful.

We intend to accelerate our strategy of opening stores in smaller French cities and elsewhere outside mainland France using the franchise model where we view the franchise model as appropriate. Increasing our number of franchised stores would increase the amount of our franchisee receivables, which would have a negative impact on our working capital. While our franchise agreements have certain provisions meant to protect our reputation and our brand and also ensure compliance with our quality standards, the franchise agreements present a number of drawbacks, such as: - our limited influence over franchisees and reliance on franchisees to implement major initiatives, limited ability to facilitate change in store ownership, limitations on enforcement of franchise obligations due to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings and inability or unwillingness of franchisees to participate in our strategic initiatives; - the need to have the support of our franchisees for marketing programs and any new capital-intensive or strategic initiatives which we may seek to undertake, and the successful execution thereof; - the fact that franchisees are independent operators and we cannot control many factors that impact the traffic in their stores, which directly affect the sales of our products generated in their stores; - our limited influence over the decision of franchisees to invest in other businesses or incur excessive indebtedness; and - termination of the agreements (whether due to non-renewal or early termination as a result of a breach) if we are not able to satisfactorily replace the franchisee or other commercial partner in a timely manner, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects. For example, one of our franchisees operated six stores in Switzerland during the year ended March 31, 2020 until these were closed in early January 2020 following the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings in respect of such franchisee, which resulted in our recording a total €1.1 million loss on bad debt during the year ended March 31, 2020 in addition to the €0.5 million recorded in the year ended March 31, 2019.

Cyber-security attacks have increased significantly during recent years, particularly since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we could face cyber-security attacks, such as ransomware, DDoS, phishing and social engineering, third parties’ vulnerabilities or data breach. Depending on the type of attack, our business activity could come to a complete stop and it could take time to restart our IT systems. We also face the risk of not being able to keep up with rapid technological change and the implementation of new systems and platforms. Additionally, we may face risks relating to liability for online content and other related risks. Our failure to respond appropriately to these risks and uncertainties could reduce our Home Delivery sales which would negatively impact our results of operations, as well as could damage our brand, reputation and prospects. In addition, we use outsourcing arrangements with third parties, notably in our logistics operations, and we do not control the facilities or operations of our suppliers. An interruption of operations at any of their or our facilities or any failure by them to deliver on their contractual commitments may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

In order for our business to function successfully, we must be able to handle and transmit confidential information, including credit card information, securely. In this regard, we are subject to the EU General Data Protection Regulation No. 2016/679 dated April 27, 2016, that entered into application on May 25, 2018, and repealing the EU Directive 95/46/EC (“GDPR”). This new regulation strengthens existing data subjects’ rights, provides for new rights and gives data subjects (including customers and employees) increased control over the processing of their personal data. The GDPR requires any person in charge of processing personal data to comply with certain obligations in respect of data processing and to monitor the processing of such data by subcontractors and persons acting under its authority. To this end, companies are, among other requirements, responsible for keeping records of processing activities. In addition, a data protection officer, in charge of data protection tasks, must be designated by businesses in certain circumstances. Concepts such as the ‘right to be forgotten’, data portability, data breach notification and accountability have also been introduced. Failure to comply with the obligations set out in the GDPR may trigger various sanctions, including administrative fines up to the greater of €20,000,000 and 4% of the annual worldwide turnover of the company. Furthermore, in France, in connection with the processing of personal data, including customers’ personal data, we are also subject to French law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978, as amended (“FDPA”), which incorporates provisions of the GDPR and provides for additional concepts such as the right for data subjects to decide on the use of their personal data after their death. The FDPA also empowers the French Data Protection Authority (Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (“CNIL”)) to ensure compliance with the French data protection legal framework, and notably the requirements set out in the GDPR and the FDPA. Failure to comply with the requirements of the FDPA may lead to sanctions similar to the ones laid down for breach of the GDPR. For the sake of completeness, it is also worth noting that criminal sanctions are also theoretically possible for particular offences related to data processing activities (primarily penalties or fines). On January 10, 2017, the European Commission published a proposal for an e-privacy regulation, replacing the existing e-privacy directive that regulated privacy-related issues in the electronic communications sector. To date, the draft e-privacy regulation is still subject to ongoing discussions and a final version thereof is expected in the upcoming months. 39 ----- Complying with the French data protection legal framework requires us to adopt new measures and implement process modifications. In particular, the GDPR and the FDPA require companies to implement technical and organizational measures to protect the personal data they process and to comply with a specific procedure in case of data breach, including, under certain circumstances, notification of such breach to the CNIL and, where applicable, communication thereof to the data subjects. The regulatory environment governing our use of personal data of customers, employees and others is complex. Privacy and information security laws and requirements change frequently, and compliance with them may require us to incur significant costs to make necessary systems changes and implement new administrative processes and we may not be able to fully comply with every law and requirement at all times. In addition, we may not be able to prevent security breaches involving customer transaction data. Any breach could cause consumers to lose confidence in the security of our website or our app. We also face the risk that the customer data we collect as part of our CRM programs or otherwise may be stolen or misappropriated. Cyber-security attacks have increased significantly in recent years and such attacks may involve data breaches. See “—The _efficiency of our supply chain and information technology systems is critical to our business and operations”. In_ event of a breach, customers may be discouraged from providing us with their data and the success of our marketing strategies could be negatively affected as a result. In all cases, our reputation could be damaged and we could experience lost sales, fines or lawsuits that may individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We require the use of refrigerated trailers to ship our products from our suppliers’ facilities to our warehouses and from our warehouses to our stores. In the year ended March 31, 2021, transportation costs (excluding transportation costs incurred by our suppliers, which are generally included in the prices we pay for products) accounted for 2.1% of our Total retail France sales. Transportation costs have historically significantly fluctuated over time, in particular in connection with oil prices, and increases could result in reduced profits. We are dependent on third parties for the transportation of our products, and this service could be disrupted. Any increases in the cost of transportation, and any disruption in transportation services, including if we are unable to renew our contracts with third-party providers on reasonable terms or at all, could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition and prospects. For example, the French government has historically introduced new taxes based on environmental and other initiatives, which have led transportation service providers to increase the prices of such services. As a result of those increases, our external expenses have also increased. In addition, there can be no guarantee that the French government will not continue to introduce similar taxes in the future, which could further impact our transportation costs.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Approximately 84% of our employees work in our network of directly-operated stores. We could experience labor disputes and work stoppages and difficulty in attracting and retaining operative personnel at one or more of our stores due to localized strikes or strikes in the larger retail food industry. We are also exposed to similar risks involving the workforce of our third-party suppliers, including all of our warehouse operators. In particular, a labor stoppage or other interruption at one of our suppliers or warehouses would impact our ability to supply our stores and could have a negative effect on our operations as a result. For instance, in January 2014, STEF, our principal logistics partner, experienced a work stoppage, which also impacted our operations. As we do not directly control our suppliers, including our warehouses, or their operations, we have no control over, and limited information on, labor relations between our suppliers and their workforces. Our business is labor intensive, so maintaining good relationships with our employees, unions and other employee representatives is crucial to our operations. As a result, any deterioration of the relationships with our employees, unions and other employee representatives could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our employees in France are covered by national collective bargaining agreements. These agreements typically complement applicable statutory provisions in respect of, among other things, the general working conditions of our employees such as maximum working hours, holidays, termination, retirement, welfare and incentives. National collective bargaining agreements and company-specific agreements also contain provisions that could affect our ability to restructure our operations and facilities or terminate 40 ----- employees. We may not be able to extend existing company-specific agreements, renew them on their current terms or, upon the expiration of such agreements, negotiate such agreements in a favorable and timely manner or without work stoppages, strikes or similar industrial actions. We may also become subject to additional company-specific agreements, or our existing national collective bargaining agreements may be amended. We can give no assurance that any future labor disturbance, work stoppage, or failure to attract and retain operative personnel at any of our facilities or our suppliers’ facilities in France or elsewhere would not have an adverse effect on that facility’s operations and, potentially, on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Our executives’ and managers’ knowledge of the market, our business and our company represents a key strength of our business model, and our experience and human capital serves as a barrier to entry to potential competitors. The success of our business strategy and our future growth also depend on our ability to attract, train, retain, motivate and manage skilled managerial, sales, administration, development and operating personnel.

National regulations that have implemented European directives applicable to frozen food products establish highly technical requirements regarding labeling, manufacturing, transportation and storage of frozen food products. Local governmental authorities also set out bacteriological conditions and restrictions. Each of our stores, our outsourced warehouse facilities and our suppliers’ facilities is subject to licensing and reporting requirements and official quality controls by numerous governmental authorities. These governmental authorities include European, national and local health, environmental, labor relations, sanitation, building, zoning, and fire and safety departments. Difficulty in obtaining or failure to obtain the necessary licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development or operation of a given retail location or warehouse facility. Any changes in those regulations may require us to implement new quality controls and possibly to invest in new equipment, which could delay the development of new products and increase our operating costs. We are also subject to various national laws and regulations relating to our commercial practices and activities. Such legislation and regulations may impose limitations on our ability to implement our business strategy and promotional activities. For example, French law No. 2018-938 dated October 30, 2018, as amended (in particular, by the provisions of the five ordinances dated April 24, 2019 which are related to the above-mentioned law), introduced a number of rules and principles relating to commercial relationships between producers and distributors, promotional activities and resale prices in mass distribution and other rules aimed at promoting healthier nutrition.

In addition, we are subject to regulations relating to asbestos in the workplace. Health, safety and environmental legislation in Europe and elsewhere have tended to become broader and stricter over time, and enforcement has become more stringent. For example, over the past few years, we have observed a stricter application and the strengthening of French laws on accessibility of public spaces. We may have to incur additional costs to remain in compliance with such laws if new rules are introduced or existing laws are strengthened in the future. We try to follow and anticipate such changes, but any failure to comply with applicable legislation may lead to penalties, fines or other sanctions. If health, safety and environmental laws and regulations in France and the other countries in which we have operations or from which 41 ----- we source ingredients are strengthened in the future, the extent and timing of investments required to maintain compliance may differ from our internal planning and may limit the availability of funding for other investments. We are also subject to regulations on the use of refrigerant fluids. Due to their environmental impact, the use of certain types of refrigerants will be prohibited in the future. In order to comply with the upcoming prohibitions, we are planning on progressively replacing the fluids we use in our installations. The costs associated with the replacement of those fluids will generally be incurred as part of our store remodelings. Although our goal remains to maintain our capital expenditures at approximately 3% of sales of goods, such costs may increase the expenditures associated with individual remodelings and store maintenance. In addition, if the costs of compliance with health, safety and environmental laws and regulations continue to increase and it is not possible for us to pass through these additional costs into the prices of our products, any such changes could result in lower profitability. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products and affect our profitability. All of our products must comply with strict national and international hygiene regulations. Our stores, our outsourced warehouses and our suppliers’ production facilities are regularly subject to inspections by authorities for compliance with hygiene regulations applicable to the sale, storage and manufacturing of foodstuffs and the traceability of genetically modified organisms, meats and other raw materials. Despite the precautions we undertake or require our suppliers to undertake, should any non-compliance with such regulations be discovered during an inspection, authorities may temporarily shut down the store, warehouse or facility concerned and levy a fine for such non-compliance, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. Furthermore, health, safety and environmental laws and regulations and civil liability (tort) rules could expose us to liabilities. Under some of these laws and regulations, we could be liable for investigating or remediating contamination at properties we own or occupy, even if the contamination was caused by a party unrelated to us, was not due to our fault or if the activity which resulted in the contamination was legal. The discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of new obligations to investigate or remediate contamination at our properties, could result in substantial unanticipated costs. In some circumstances, we could be required to pay fines or damages under these laws and regulations. Regulatory authorities may also require us to curtail operations or temporarily or permanently close facilities.

Sales of frozen food products, including seafood, frozen vegetables and complete frozen meals, have historically tended to be higher during the winter months. December sales have historically been approximately double those of other months due to, among other factors, Christmas and New Year celebrations. Sales volumes also increase, albeit at a significantly lower level, around Valentine’s Day, due to our strong marketing campaigns, and around Easter. During the summer months, sales volumes have historically decreased as declines in sales in urban areas are only partially offset by increases in summer vacation destinations. At the end of the summer vacation period, sales have historically increased slightly as customers tend to restock their freezers upon returning home. These cyclical fluctuations in our inventory can also affect our working capital requirements. In addition, because Easter falls on a different date each year, some of our fiscal years may include two Easters while others may include no Easter. For these reasons, sequential quarterly comparisons may not be a good indication of our comparative performance between two periods or how we may perform in the future.

Generally, our commercial leases provide for an annual rent adjustment based on the changes in certain national indices. Currently, the applicable indices for our leases are either the cost of construction index (Indice du Coût de la _Construction (“ICC”)) or the commercial rents index (Indice des Loyers Commerciaux (“ILC”)).

Our renewed or new commercial lease agreements are subject to the ILC, with the remainder being subject to the ICC until their termination date. Although less volatile than the ICC, the ILC can increase at a higher rate than the ICC over a given period. Rents indexed to the ILC could therefore be adjusted upward at a faster rate, potentially increasing our expenses and having an adverse effect on our profitability and results of operations.

Beginning January 1, 2011, these reductions have been calculated on the basis of annual compensation (including all bonuses, overtime and other remuneration) instead of monthly compensation as used historically. This change resulted in higher social security contributions and has had an adverse effect on our profitability. Any additional change in the provisions applicable to this reduction, particularly with respect to the reduction rate or the calculation basis, could result in a further increase in our wage and salary expenses, which may adversely impact our profitability. Furthermore, our method of calculation of the applicable rate could be challenged during social security audits and result in subsequent contribution reassessments. For example, following an URSSAF audit performed in respect of calendar years 2014 to 2016, we received a reassessment notification from the URSSAF on December 19, 2017. The URSSAF alleged that we applied erroneous methods of calculation for various social security contributions, including with respect to the computation of the “allègements Fillon” reductions. The amount of the reassessment for the calendar years 2014 to 2016 is €4.3 million, plus an additional €0.5 million as penalties for late payment. The €4.3 million reassessment, excluding the penalties for late payment, was paid in January 2018 and recorded in our profit and loss for the year ended March 31, 2018. Although we are challenging the URSSAF position, from April 1, 2017 we have taken into account the URSSAF interpretation when accruing our social security contributions and have consequently recorded a provision for the penalties for late payment and for the difference between the computation using our methodology and the computation using the URSSAF methodology. Due to this change in methodology, our social charges rate increased in the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. 43 ----- The CICE, a tax credit introduced in France on December 29, 2012 by the “Loi de Finance rectificative” to boost competitiveness and employment to the benefit of companies, was based on the remunerations that employers pay to their employees during a calendar year. During the year ended March 31, 2019, the CICE resulted in a reduction of our social security costs in an amount of €4.8 million. The CICE was calculated as a percentage of the gross amount of remunerations paid to employees over the course of a calendar year that do not exceed 2.5 times the SMIC. The applicable CICE rate, which amounted to 7% of gross compensation in the calendar year 2017, had been reduced to 6% in the calendar year 2018 by the French “Loi de finances 2018” (the “2018 French Finance Law”). Pursuant to the 2018 French Finance Law, the CICE was repealed as from January 1, 2019. Although this repeal was offset by a decrease of 6 percentage points in social security contributions for employees earning less than 2.5 times the SMIC, the corresponding reduction is itself subject to income tax, whereas the CICE was a direct reduction of income tax, therefore negatively impacting our income tax charge. Further changes in any of the above-mentioned laws or regulations or the coming into force of any new laws or regulations could substantially increase our operating expenses or restrict our operational flexibility and therefore have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Our ability to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs and the Senior Notes, will depend upon the availability of cash on hand, the Group’s ability to generate and upstream cash from our operating subsidiaries to the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer and to the SN Issuer, and upon the Group’s operating performance, which is affected by all the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. We will only be able to pay interest, or principal, on the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes from funds received from the operating subsidiaries of the Picard Group. Our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions to us will depend on our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow and to upstream distributions to the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer and the SN Issuer in the form of dividends. In addition, dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed, and we may decide not to, or be unable to, declare a dividend. Furthermore, the Indentures as well as the terms of other future debt may prevent or limit our ability to upstream cash or to make distributions or payments of capital or income or use cash or other assets to make principal or interest payments when due on our indebtedness, including the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs and the Senior Notes.

Therefore, our ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes may be limited by a number of factors, including the following factors: - the actual amount of dividends distributed and the decision to make any distribution is entirely at our discretion and future dividend distributions, if any, will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, distributable reserves, provisions of applicable law and other factors that we may deem relevant; - the amount of dividends distributed will be subject to contractual restrictions under the restrictive payment covenants contained in the Indentures and may be subject to the terms of any other outstanding indebtedness incurred by us or any subsidiaries of the respective Issuers after the completion of the Offerings; - legal restrictions imposed on distributions of profits and reserves and repayments of share capital, including restrictions imposed by corporate and tax laws of France and Luxembourg; - the adverse tax consequences associated with making such upstream distributions; and - the absence of any contractual or other legal right to dividends for the benefit of any of our shareholders.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

As of March 31, 2021, as adjusted to give effect to the Offerings, the use of proceeds thereof and the other Transactions, we had €1,963.6 million of as adjusted net debt, including certain leases and bank guarantees less cash and cash equivalents, of which €1,400 million would have been represented by the Senior Secured Notes and €310 million by the Senior Notes. Our ability to make payments on or to refinance any of the Notes, or our other debt obligations, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This depends on general economic, financial, competitive, market, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our significant leverage may also make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to any or all of the Notes and exposes us to interest rate increases to the extent any of our variable rate debt, including under the Floating Rate SSNs and the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, is not hedged. We currently do not have any hedging agreements in place. Our businesses may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations to make payments on our debt obligations, and additional debt and equity financing may not be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debts when due, or to refinance such debts, including the Notes. If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources are insufficient to pay obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to: - reduce or delay our business activities, planned acquisitions and capital expenditures; - sell assets; - obtain additional debt or equity financing; or - restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity. We can make no assurance that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms, if at all. In particular, our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend in part on our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates than our current debt and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments and the Indentures may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. Furthermore, we may be unable to find alternative financing, and even if we could obtain alternative financing, it might not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are not able to refinance any of our debt, obtain additional financing or sell assets on commercially reasonable terms or at all, we may not be able to satisfy our debt obligations, including our obligations under any or all of the Notes. In that event, borrowings under other debt agreement or instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions may become payable on demand, and we may not have sufficient funds to repay all our debts, including any or all of the Notes. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest or principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction or downgrade of our credit ratings, which could harm our ability to 49 ----- incur additional indebtedness. In the absence of such operating results and resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. The terms of our indebtedness, including under the Indentures, restrict our ability to transfer or sell assets and to use the proceeds from any such disposition.

A significant portion of our current debt, including under the Existing Senior Secured Notes and our Existing Revolving Credit Facility, is subject to variable interest rates indexed to Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). Following the Transactions, a significant portion of our debt, including under the Floating Rate SSNs and the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility, will be subject to variable interest rates indexed to EURIBOR. We may also enter into additional indebtedness bearing floating rates of interest in the future, including by issuing additional Floating Rate SSNs. EURIBOR, LIBOR and/or any other floating interest rate index applicable to such indebtedness could rise significantly in the future. To the extent that interest rates were to increase significantly, our interest expense would correspondingly increase to the extent of the drawings under, or issuances of, such debt bearing floating rates of interest, thereby reducing our cash flow. We may enter into certain interest rate hedging obligations designed to fix a portion of these rates but are not required to do so. In addition, there can be no assurance that hedging will be available on commercially reasonable terms or, if available, will be successful in mitigating the risks related to increasing interest rates. See “Description of Other _Indebtedness”._ Following allegations of manipulation of LIBOR, a measure of interbank lending rates, regulators and law enforcement agencies from a number of governments and the European Union are conducting investigations into whether the banks that contribute data in connection with the calculation of EURIBOR or LIBOR may have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate EURIBOR and LIBOR. As a result, EURIBOR, LIBOR and other interest rates are indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks” are the subject of recent and ongoing national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, including the implementation of the IOSCO Principles for Financial Market Benchmarks (July 2013) and Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the “Benchmarks Regulation”) which was published in the Official Journal of the EU on June 29, 2016, and applies since January 1, 2018. Some of these reforms are already effective while others are still to be implemented. The Benchmarks Regulation applies to the provision of benchmarks, the contribution of input data to a benchmark and the use of a benchmark, within the EU. It will, among other things, (i) require benchmark administrators to be authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, to be subject to an equivalent regime or otherwise recognized or endorsed) and (ii) prevent certain uses by EU-supervised entities of benchmarks of administrators that are not authorized or registered (or, if non-EU-based, not deemed equivalent or recognized or endorsed). These reforms, including the Benchmarks Regulation, may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. Any such consequence could have a material adverse effect on our debt linked to such a benchmark, including the Floating Rate SSNs and our Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility, in particular, if the methodology or other terms of the EURIBOR benchmark are changed in order to comply with the requirements of the Benchmarks Regulation. Such changes could, among other things, have the effect of reducing, increasing or otherwise affecting the volatility of the published rate or level of the EURIBOR benchmark. In addition, any of the international, national or other proposals for reform, or the general increased regulatory scrutiny of benchmarks, could increase the costs and risks of administering or otherwise participating in the setting of a benchmark, including EURIBOR and LIBOR, and complying with any such regulations or requirements. Such factors may have the following effects on certain benchmarks such as EURIBOR: discourage market participants from continuing to administer or contribute to such benchmark; trigger changes in the rules or methodologies used in the benchmarks, or lead to the disappearance of the benchmark. On July 27, 2017, and in subsequent speeches (including the speech by its chief executive on July 12, 2018) the UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021 and on March 5, 2021 it further confirmed that it intends to cease providing all LIBOR settings for all currencies, subject to any rights that it has to compel continuation of such publication (the “FCA Announcements”). The FCA has confirmed that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by 50 ----- any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and the one-week and two-month U.S. dollar settings; and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar settings. The elimination of the LIBOR benchmark or any other benchmark, changes in the manner of administration of any benchmark, or actions by regulators or law enforcement agencies could result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined, which could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions, or result in other consequences, in respect of any debt linked to such benchmark. Any of the above changes or any other consequential changes as a result of international, national or other proposals for reform or other initiatives or investigations, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported LIBOR, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of and return on any floating rate debt linked to LIBOR and on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. Any elimination of the EURIBOR benchmark, or changes in the manner of administration of EURIBOR, could require an adjustment to the terms and conditions of our floating rate debt (including the Floating Rate SSNs and our Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility) or hedging. Any such adjustment, as well as manipulative practices or the cessation thereof, may result in a sudden or prolonged increase in reported EURIBOR or LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on our ability to service debt that bears interest at floating rates of interest. Any such consequence could have a material adverse impact on the value of and return on our floating rate debt (including the Floating Rate SSNs and our Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility). In addition, the development of alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR may result in our floating rate debt (including the Floating Rate SSNs and our Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility) performing differently than would otherwise have been the case if the alternatives to EURIBOR or LIBOR had not developed. The Floating Rate SSN Indenture will provide a mechanism whereby, if (1) there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR, (2) EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently, (3) there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR, (4) an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital markets applicable generally to floating rate notes or (5) it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or a third-party agent of such Issuer to calculate any payments due to holders of the Floating Rate SSNs using EURIBOR, (a) an independent financial institution of international standing or an independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an affiliate of such Issuer) as appointed by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer at the expense of such Issuer or (b) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to under (a), the Floating Rate SSN Issuer (or an agent thereof), acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, shall select a successor rate to EURIBOR that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been recommended or selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or body or that is expected to develop as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Floating Rate SSNs (and any applicable adjustment spread required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to holders of the Floating Rate SSNs as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR for use in calculating the appropriate successor rate, which upon certification (by way of an Officer’s Certificate) by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer of such rate to each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Principal Paying Agent will be used to calculate the interest rate in relation to the Floating Rate SSNs (upon which each of the Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Principal Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever) without any further action or consent by the noteholders or the Trustee. This means that interest on the Floating Rate SSNs would be determined on the basis of a benchmark rate, together with adjustments, that was not contemplated at the time you purchased the Floating Rate SSNs issued on the Issue Date. See “Description of the Floating Rate _Senior Secured Notes—Principal, Maturity and Interest”. The Floating Rate SSN Indenture may require the_ exercise of discretion by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer and the making of potentially subjective judgments (including as to the occurrence or not of any events which may trigger amendments to the Floating Rate SSN Indenture) without the consent of the holders of such Notes. The interests of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer in making such determinations or amendments may be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. In addition, due to the uncertainty concerning the availability of an appropriate successor rate and the involvement of an independent financial institution, the Floating Rate SSN Indenture’s successor rate mechanism may not operate as intended at the relevant time. If EURIBOR were discontinued or otherwise unavailable, the rate of interest on our floating rate debt (including the Floating Rate SSNs and our Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility) will be determined for the relevant period by the fallback provisions applicable to such debt. 51 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

In particular, if the indirect parent company of the Issuers, Lux TopCo, any of its subsidiaries or its shareholders are unable to repay their debt obligations and default thereon, their creditors may take control of the Picard Group and trigger such a change of control offer. Our obligations under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility would also be accelerated upon the occurrence of a change of control. The relevant Issuer’s ability to repurchase any or all of the Notes as will be required by the relevant Indenture will depend on such Issuer’s access to funds at such time, and it may not be able to secure access to enough cash to finance the repurchase.

If the secured creditors choose to enforce by way of foreclosure (whether a judicial or contractual foreclosure), the secured liabilities would be deemed extinguished up to the value of the foreclosed securities. Such value is determined either by the court in the context of a judicial attribution or by a pre-contractually agreed expert in the context of a contractual foreclosure and if the value of the relevant Collateral exceeds the amount of secured debt, the secured creditors may be required to pay the obligor a cash amount (the “soulte”) equal to the difference between the value of the shares and the amount of the secured debt. This is true regardless of the actual amount of proceeds ultimately received by the secured creditors from a subsequent on-sale of the relevant Collateral. Consequently, in the event the lenders under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility or the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or the Senior Notes, respectively, decide to, and are entitled to, enforce the assets pledges through a judicial or contractual foreclosure and if the value of such assets exceed the amount of the secured debt, the lenders under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes, or the Senior Notes, respectively, may be required to pay to the relevant pledgors a soulte equal to the value by which such assets exceeds the amount of secured debt. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, we purport to defer the payment of the soulte to the earlier of (i) the date which is 12 months after the date on which such foreclosure occurs and (ii) the date on which the relevant debt is considered discharged in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement. The right to defer or subordinate the payment to the security provider of the “soulte”, such as provided in the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement, has not been tested in French courts. If the value of such assets is less than the amount of the secured debt, the relevant amount owed to the relevant creditors will be reduced by an amount equal to the value of such assets, and the remaining amount owed to such creditors will be unsecured. Should the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes, respectively, decline to request the judicial or contractual foreclosure of the assets, a realization of the pledged assets could be undertaken by public auction in accordance with applicable law. If enforcement is implemented through a public auction procedure, it is possible that the sale price received in any such auction might not reflect the value of the securities, since the latter will not be sold pursuant to a competitive bid process and/or a private sale organized by an investment bank and controlled by the vendor on the basis of a value determined pursuant to the methods usually used for the purpose of the acquisition of companies or groups of companies. The enforcement of security may give rise to certain subrogation or similar recourse rights by the security grantor up to the value of the debt discharged as a result of such enforcement. Although the Intercreditor Agreement includes assignment of all present and future recourse rights provisions (see “Description of Other _Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”), clauses providing for the assignment of the right of recourse have not_ been tested before the French Courts and their enforceability is therefore uncertain.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

In addition, as all of the assets of the Issuers, their respective Guarantors and their respective subsidiaries and those of their directors and executive officers are located outside of the United States, you may be unable to enforce against them judgments obtained in the U.S. courts. Moreover, in light of decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, actions of the Issuers and the Guarantors may not be subject to the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws of the United States. The United States is not currently bound by a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters with France or Luxembourg. There is, therefore, doubt as to the enforceability in France or Luxembourg of civil liabilities based upon U.S. securities laws in an action to enforce a U.S. judgment in France or Luxembourg. In addition, the enforcement in France or Luxembourg of any judgment obtained in a U.S. court based on civil liabilities, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws, will be subject to certain conditions.

See “Summary—Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; illustrative Normalized Sales and _Normalized EBITDA”. Illustrative Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA are not forecasts or estimates of_ our future results, but are merely illustrations of the possible movement in revenue and EBITDA under certain assumptions. The assumptions we have made with respect to Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA that we present in this Offering Memorandum are based on our current estimates and they involve risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any anticipated future results, performance or achievements implied by such adjusted financial information. Specifically, to derive these normalized financial metrics, management has based its calculations upon certain assumptions regarding (i) market size and market share evolution after the pandemic and (ii) our basket size and number of tickets after the pandemic. In particular, our Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA are calculated using the year ended March 31, 2020 as a reference year (with EBITDA margin based on an interpolation of the historical EBITDA margins for the years ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020 at the illustrative sales level); however, our results during the year ended March 31, 2020 may have been impacted by factors that may not continue to apply in future periods. In particular, we have assumed that the market size in France will normalize from a COVID-19 peak but will nonetheless retain a portion of its growth during the pandemic, due to the change in consumer habits, and that we will slightly increase our market share, based on historical trends. In addition, we have assumed that results in our other businesses (including newly opened stores, Home Delivery, franchises and international activity) will remain stable as the reversion towards pre-COVID levels is offset by international expansion, new franchises and new store openings. We have assumed that the number of tickets will slightly 54 ----- increase, given the net new customers gained, and that a portion of the basket size increase is sustainable, given that customers have new cooking and consumption habits. There is no assurance that any such assumptions will be correct or that our future results will be as implied by such adjusted financial metrics. You should exercise caution when evaluating the adjustments reflected in illustrative Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA and whether you consider these to be appropriate, as this information is inherently subject to risks and uncertainties. Illustrative Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA have not been audited or independently reviewed by our auditors. It should not be considered as an alternative to net income or operating income as indicators of our performance, nor as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of our liquidity. While we use illustrative Normalized Sales and Normalized EBITDA to illustrate our operating performance, such measures as presented in this Offering Memorandum may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies, due to, among other things, differences in the way such measures are calculated.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

After payment to the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, each of the respective Issuers will have no responsibility or liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests. Accordingly, if investors own a book-entry interest, they must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, and if investors are not participants in Euroclear and Clearstream, they must rely on the procedures of the participant through which they own their interest, to exercise any rights and obligations of a holder of Senior Secured Notes or Senior Notes, respectively, under the relevant Indenture.

Such failure may result in the invalidity of the security interest in the collateral securing the relevant Notes or adversely affect the priority of such security interest in favor of the relevant Notes against third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral. In addition, applicable law requires that certain property and rights acquired after the grant of a general security interest, such as real property, equipment subject to a certificate and certain proceeds, only be perfected at or promptly following the time such property and rights are acquired and identified.

Such multijurisdictional proceedings are likely to be complex and costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your rights. There can also be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings. In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of the relevant Guarantors’ jurisdictions of organization may be materially different from, or in conflict with, those of the United States, including in the areas of rights of creditors, priority of governmental and other creditors, ability to obtain postpetition interest and duration of the proceeding.

Furthermore, the current applicable insolvency and administrative laws of Luxembourg and France may change in the future. The content and the effect of any such changes in law cannot be predicted, may not be favorable to holders of the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs and the Senior Notes, and may adversely affect the situation of such holders. On February 1, 2013, the Luxembourg government introduced a proposal to reorganize the insolvency regime currently in place in Luxembourg, which is currently at an advanced stage in the legislative process. We cannot predict the impact, the nature or the extent of the changes that may be adopted as a consequence of this proposal, if any. Finally, pursuant to EU Council Regulation No. 2015/848 (the “EU Insolvency Regulation”), the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member 56 ----- State (other than Denmark) where the company has its “center of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). There is a presumption under Article 3(1) of EU Council Regulation No. 2015/848 that a company has its center of main interests in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary and only if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that the presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Preamble 30 of the EU Insolvency Regulation clarifies that the relevant court of a Member State should carefully assess whether the center of the debtor’s main interests is genuinely located in that Member State and that it should be possible to rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual center of management and supervision and of the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Therefore, to the extent that the “center of main interests” of the relevant Issuer or a Guarantor is deemed to be in France or Luxembourg, courts of France or Luxembourg may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the relevant Issuer (or a French guarantor or a guarantor incorporated in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg).

The Senior Notes Guarantors will guarantee and will provide security in respect of their respective Guarantee on a senior subordinated basis. The Senior Secured Notes Guarantors are organized under the laws of France and Luxembourg and the Senior Notes Guarantors are organized under the laws of Luxembourg. Enforcement of the obligations under the Guarantees against a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or a Senior Notes Guarantor will be subject to certain defenses available to an SSN Issuer, the SN Issuer or the relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor, as the case may be. These laws and defenses may include those that relate to fraudulent conveyance, financial assistance, voidable preference, 58 ----- insolvency or bankruptcy challenges, preservation of share capital, thin capitalization, capital maintenance, corporate benefit and regulations or defenses affecting the rights of creditors generally. If one or more of these laws and defenses are applicable, the Guarantors may have no liability or decreased liability under their respective Guarantees or the security interest in the relevant Collateral may be void or may not be enforceable depending on the amounts of its other obligations and applicable law. Under French financial assistance rules, a company is prohibited from guaranteeing indebtedness of another company that is used, directly or indirectly, for the purpose of its acquisition. Under French corporate benefit rules, a court could subordinate or void any guarantee and, if payment had already been made under the relevant guarantee, require that the recipient return the payment to the relevant guarantor, if the court found that the French guarantor did not derive an overall corporate benefit from the transaction involving the grant of the guarantee as a whole. Existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter, which must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Based on current case law: - the company giving the guarantee must itself receive an actual benefit or advantage (direct or indirect) from the transaction involving the giving of the guarantee taken as a whole which is commensurate with the liability which it takes on under the guarantee; - the financial commitment assumed by the guarantor must not exceed its financial capability; and - (as regards group benefit) the guarantor and the person whose obligations are being guaranteed must belong to the same group and have real common economic purposes and policy, and the guarantee, and the transaction to which it relates, must be entered into in furtherance of the common economic interest of the group as a whole (not just its shareholders) and the liability under the guarantee should be commensurate with such group benefit. Similarly, a Luxembourg guarantor may only encumber its assets or provide guarantees in accordance with its corporate objects and for its corporate benefit. There is no Luxembourg legislation governing group companies which specifically regulates the establishment, organization and liability of groups of companies. Consequently, the concept of group interest as opposed to the interest of the individual corporate entity is not expressly recognized. Except as described below, a company may, in principle, not encumber its assets or provide guarantees in favor of group companies in general (at least as far as parent companies and fellow subsidiaries of its parent companies are concerned). Based on current case law and legal literature, a Luxembourg company may, in principle, validly assist other group companies, in accordance with the provisions of the Luxembourg law on commercial companies dated August 10, 1915, as amended (the “Luxembourg Companies Law”), if: (a) they are part of a group; (b) it can be established that the guarantor derives a benefit from granting such assistance or that, at least, there is no disruption of the balance of interests in the group to the detriment of the Luxembourg guarantor; and (c) the assistance is not, in terms of the amounts involved, disproportionate to the guarantor’s financial means and the benefits derived from granting such assistance. In addition, each of the Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Senior Secured Notes Guarantor or Senior Notes Guarantor, as applicable, without rendering its respective guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law. In addition, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantee of any Senior Secured Notes Guarantor incorporated under the laws of France (each, a “French Guarantor”) in respect of the payment obligations of an SSN Issuer under the applicable Senior Secured Notes Indenture and the relevant Notes: - will not include any obligation or liability which, if incurred, would constitute the provision of financial assistance within the meaning of article L.225-216 of the French Commercial Code or any other laws having the same effect and/or would constitute a misuse of corporate assets or corporate credit within the meaning of articles L.241-3, L.242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Commercial Code; - will be limited, at any time, to the aggregate of all amounts directly or indirectly (by way of intercompany loans or similar arrangement directly or indirectly) received from an SSN Issuer out of the proceeds of the offering of the Senior Secured Notes issued by such SSN Issuer by such French 59 ----- Guarantor and outstanding from time to time and will be limited to the amount outstanding, if any, on the date a payment is requested to be made by that French Guarantor under its relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantee. Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its relevant Senior Secured Notes Guarantee will reduce pro tanto the maximum amount of its relevant Guarantee. It should be noted that if a court were to decide that giving a Guarantee of the Notes constituted financial assistance or was not in the corporate benefit of the relevant French Guarantor, then such Guarantee could be reduced to zero. In each case, any reduction in the amount of the relevant intercompany loan, including by operation of the Intercreditor Agreement, would reduce the amount of the Guarantee. By virtue of the foregoing limitations, a French Guarantor’s obligation under its Guarantee could be significantly less than amounts payable with respect to the Notes, or it may have effectively no obligation under its Guarantee. In addition, the granting of new security interests in connection with the issuance of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes may be at risk of falling within the scope of clawback rules if entered into during the hardening periods for such security interests in France and Luxembourg (save for financial collateral arrangements within the meaning of the Luxembourg Collateral Law). The applicable clawback rules for these new security interests will run from the moment each new security interest has been granted or perfected, provided they take place during the hardening period. The Indentures will permit the security interests in the relevant Collateral to be released and retaken in certain circumstances. Assuming such release and retaking have occurred during the hardening period, there is a risk that the relevant clawback rules apply. In case any of the security providers was to be declared insolvent by the competent court, the court could establish a period before the insolvency judgment (the so-called “hardening period”) within which the court-appointed insolvency receiver (or the public prosecutor in France) will have to carefully consider any transactions entered into during this hardening period (see “Certain Insolvency Law Considerations, Limitations on Validity and Enforceability of the _Guarantees and the Security Interests—France—The “hardening period” (période suspecte) in judicial and liquidation proceedings”). With the exception of any security interest being financial collateral arrangements_ within the meaning of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, any security interest entered into during the so-called “hardening period” will be analyzed by the court-appointed insolvency receiver and may be, as the case may be, challenged by the court-appointed insolvency receiver (including in France the creditor representative, the judicial administrator or the plan commissioner) or the public prosecutor in France and may be declared void or ineffective by the competent court. It is possible that a Guarantor, or a creditor of a Guarantor, the grantor of security interests, or the creditor thereof, or the bankruptcy trustee in the case of a bankruptcy of a Guarantor or grantor of such security interests, may contest the validity and enforceability of the Guarantor’s Guarantee and that the applicable court may determine that the Guarantee or the security interests should be limited or voided. To the extent that agreed limitations on the guarantee obligation apply, the relevant Notes would be to that extent effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the applicable Guarantor and/or grantor, including trade payables of such Guarantor and/or grantor, as applicable. Future Guarantees and/or security interests may be subject to similar limitations. See “—The insolvency and administrative laws of Luxembourg and France, as the case may be, may not be favorable _to creditors, including investors in the Notes and may limit your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes, the Guarantees or the security interests in the Collateral.”_",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The holders of the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs or the Senior Notes, as applicable, may not control certain decisions regarding the Collateral.","The Intercreditor Agreement regulates the ability of the Trustees or the holders of the Notes to instruct the relevant Security Agent to take enforcement action. The Senior Secured Notes Security Agent may act upon the instructions of the class of secured creditors that first delivers a notice to enforce the Collateral to the Senior Secured Notes Security Agent, provided that it receives written consent to do so or the same enforcement instructions from: (i) creditors holding more than 66 2/3% of the indebtedness and commitments under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility, any other credit facility permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement and certain priority hedging obligations (the “Majority Super Senior Creditors”); and (ii) creditors holding more than 50% of the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Notes and indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes (the “Majority Senior Non Priority Creditors”) (in each case acting through their respective creditor representative) prior to the “enforcement instruction effective date” (as defined in the Intercreditor Agreement). The Intercreditor Agreement further provides that in the event that the Majority Super Senior Creditors and the Majority Senior Non Priority Creditors have not consented to the relevant enforcement instructions or if conflicting enforcement instructions are received from any creditor representative prior to the enforcement instruction effective date, the creditor representatives must consult with each other in good faith for a period of 30 days (or such shorter period as such creditor representatives agree) to agree on joint enforcement instructions. Although enforcement instructions given by holders of the Senior Secured Notes and certain other creditors may prevail after such 30-day consultation period, under certain circumstances, enforcement instructions by the lenders under our Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility and certain other creditors will prevail. If the creditor representatives are not able to agree on joint enforcement instructions by the end of the consultation period, the Senior Secured Notes Security Agent shall enforce the Collateral in accordance with the terms of the enforcement instructions (if any) given by the Majority Senior Non Priority Creditors, provided that if: (i) the super senior creditors (comprised of the creditors in respect of the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility and any other credit facility permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement and the counterparties to certain of our priority hedging arrangements) have not been fully repaid within six months of the end of the consultation period; (ii) the Senior Secured Notes Security Agent has not received any enforcement instructions from the Majority Senior Non Priority Creditors within 90 days of the end of the consultation period; or (iii) the SN Issuer or any of its subsidiaries becomes subject to insolvency or similar proceedings and the Senior Secured Notes Security Agent has not commenced any enforcement action at that time, then the instructions given by the Majority Super Senior Creditors will prevail. To the extent that we incur indebtedness that is secured by the Collateral on a pari passu basis with the Senior Secured Notes, the voting interest of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes in the Majority Senior Non Priority Creditors will be diluted commensurate with the amount of such indebtedness we incur. 61 ----- The Intercreditor Agreement will subject the Senior Notes to certain standstill provisions relating to the enforcement of the Collateral and the subordination of the guarantees by the Senior Notes Guarantors of the Senior Notes. See “—Additional Risks Related to the Senior Notes—Investors’ right to receive payment under the _Senior Notes Guarantees is contractually subordinated to senior debt”._ Disputes may occur between the holders of the Fixed Rate SSNs, the holders of the Floating Rate SSNs, the holders of the Senior Notes, the lenders under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, creditors of certain future indebtedness and certain hedging counterparties as to the appropriate manner of pursuing enforcement remedies and strategies with respect to the relevant Collateral. In such an event, in situations described above where the holders of the Fixed Rate SSNs, the holders of the Floating Rate SSNs or the holders of the Senior Notes, as applicable, do not control enforcement, the relevant holders would be bound by any decisions of the creditors under our other debt instruments, including the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility, which may result in enforcement action, or absence thereof in respect of the relevant Collateral, whether or not such action is approved by the relevant holders or may be adverse to such holders of the Fixed Rate SSNs, holders of the Floating Rate SSNs or holders of the Senior Notes. The creditors under certain hedging arrangements and the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement or other indebtedness that may be issued in the future may have interests that are different from the interests of holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the holders of the Senior Notes, as applicable, and such creditors may elect to pursue their remedies under the security documents at a time when it would otherwise be disadvantageous for the holders of the Senior Secured Notes or the holders of the Senior Notes to do so. If the relevant Security Agent sells the relevant Collateral comprising the shares of Lux Midco or, if applicable, the shares of any of its subsidiaries as a result of an enforcement action in accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, claims under the Senior Secured Notes, the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees (together with claims under the Senior Secured Notes) and the liens over any other assets securing the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees may be released. See “Description of Other Indebtedness— _Intercreditor Agreement”, “Description of the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes—Security”, “Description of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes—Security” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Security”._ In addition, the ability of the relevant Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the relevant Collateral is subject to mandatory provisions of the laws of each jurisdiction in which security interests over the relevant Collateral are taken. For example, the laws of certain jurisdictions may not allow for an appropriation of certain pledged assets, but require a sale through a public auction and certain waiting periods may apply. There is some uncertainty under the laws of certain jurisdictions as to whether obligations to beneficial owners of the Senior Secured Notes or the Senior Notes that are not identified as registered holders in a security document will be validly secured. The Collateral governed by French law that will secure the obligations of the SSN Issuers, the SN Issuer and the Guarantors under the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes will not be granted directly to the holders of the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs or the Senior Notes, but will be granted only in favor of the relevant Security Agent under the French security agent (agent des sûretés) mechanism under the Intercreditor Agreement. The Collateral will also secure our obligations under, inter alia, the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging obligations (the “Super Senior Liabilities”). The Intercreditor Agreement, the Indentures and the Security Documents will provide that only the relevant Security Agent, as security agent (and /or as parallel debt creditor, as applicable), has the right to enforce its security interests in the relevant Collateral. As a consequence, holders of the Senior Secured Notes and holders of the Senior Notes, respectively, will not have direct security interests and in any event will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of the relevant Collateral, except through the relevant Trustee under the relevant Indenture, who will (subject to the provisions of the relevant Indenture) provide instructions to the relevant Security Agent for the relevant Collateral. In certain jurisdictions, due to the laws and other case law governing the creation and perfection of security interests and enforceability of such security interests, the respective Collateral may secure a so-called “parallel debt” obligation (the “Parallel Debt Obligation”) created under the Intercreditor Agreement and/or the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture and/or the Floating Rate SSN Indenture and/or the Senior Notes Indenture in favor of the relevant Security Agent as well as, or in lieu of, securing the obligations under the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs or the Senior Notes, as applicable, directly. This parallel debt structure is used where certain jurisdictions have legal requirements relating to the creation and ongoing valid existence of security interests which are linked with the original secured claims and where certain actions under the finance documents, such as novation, may 62 ----- adversely impact the security interests under local law. The parallel debt is in the same amount and payable at the same time as the obligations of the relevant Issuer and the relevant Guarantors under the relevant Notes and the relevant Guarantees (the “Principal Obligations”), and any payment in respect of the Principal Obligations will discharge the corresponding parallel debt and any payment in respect of the parallel debt will discharge the corresponding Principal Obligations. Although the relevant Security Agent will have, pursuant to the parallel debt, a claim against the relevant Issuer and the relevant Guarantors (subject to applicable limitation language) for the full principal amount of the relevant Notes, the parallel debt structure has not been tested in court in these jurisdictions and there is no judicial guidance as to its efficacy and therefore it cannot be excluded that the parallel debt will not per se eliminate or mitigate the risk of unenforceability of the security interests in the relevant Collateral. Therefore, the ability of the relevant Security Agent to enforce the security interests in the relevant Collateral may be restricted. In addition, holders of the relevant Notes bear some risk associated with a possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Security Agent. Under French law, certain “accessory” security interests such as pledges require that the pledgee and the creditor be the same person. Such security interests cannot be held on behalf of third parties who do not hold the secured claim, unless they act as fiduciary under Article 2011 of the French Civil Code or as security agent (agent des sûretés) under Articles 2488-6 et seq. of the French Civil Code. In order to permit the beneficial holders of the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs or the Senior Notes to benefit from a secured claim, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide for the creation of a “parallel debt” in favor of the Senior Secured Notes Security Agent or the Senior Notes Security Agent. Pursuant to the parallel debt, the relevant Security Agent becomes the holder of a claim equal to each amount payable by an obligor under the relevant Notes. Such “parallel debt” is intended to be an obligation owed to the Secured Notes Security Agent or the Senior Notes Security Agent, as applicable, which, as such, would be capable of being effectively secured by a security interest granted to the Secured Notes Security Agent or the Senior Notes Security Agent, as applicable. To the extent that the security interests in the relevant Collateral created under the parallel debt construct are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the relevant Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the relevant Collateral. Although the enforceability in France of certain rights of a security agent (e.g., the filing of claims in safeguard proceedings) benefiting from a parallel debt was recognized in France by the French Supreme Court (Cour de cassation) (Cass. Com. September 13, 2011 n°10-25533 Belvedere), none of the “parallel debt” and trust mechanism constructs have been generally recognized by French courts and to the extent that any Notes or security interests created under the “parallel debt” and/or trust constructs are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the relevant Notes will not receive any proceeds from an enforcement of the parallel debt in respect of the relevant Guarantees or security interests in the relevant Collateral. In addition, the holders of the relevant Notes will bear the risks associated with the possible insolvency or bankruptcy of the relevant Security Agent. The Belvedere decision is the only published decision of the French Supreme Court on “parallel debt” mechanisms relating to bond documentation governed by New York law. This decision only recognized the enforceability in France of certain rights of a security agent benefiting from a “parallel debt”. In particular, the French Supreme Court upheld the proof of claim of the legal holders of a “parallel debt” claim, considering that it did not contravene French international public policy (ordre public international) rules. The ruling was made on the basis that the French debtor was not exposed to double payment or artificial liability as a result of the “parallel debt” mechanism. Although this court decision is generally viewed by legal practitioners and academics as recognition by French courts of “parallel debt” structures in such circumstances, there can be no assurance that such a structure will be effective in all cases before French courts. Indeed, it should be noted that the legal issue addressed by the Belvedere decision is limited to the proof of claims. The French Supreme Court was not asked to generally uphold French security interests securing a “parallel debt”. It should be noted that case law on this matter is scarce and based on a case-by-case analysis. Such a decision should not be considered as a general recognition of the enforceability in France of the rights of a security agent benefiting from a “parallel debt” claim. There is no certainty that the “parallel debt” construction will eliminate the risk of unenforceability under French law. To the extent that the security interests in the relevant Collateral created under the parallel debt construct are successfully challenged by other parties, holders of the Fixed Rate SSNs, the holders of the Floating Rate SSNs, the holders of the Senior Notes and holders of the Senior Notes will not receive proceeds from an enforcement of the security interests in the relevant Collateral. Pursuant to French law no. 2019-486 of May 22, 2019, the government is authorized to reform the legal regime of security interest governed by French law. We cannot predict the impact, the nature or the extent of the changes that may be adopted as a consequence of this proposal, if any. 63 ----- The concept of “trust” has been recognized by the French Tax Code and the French Supreme Court (Cour de _cassation), which has held, in the same published decision referred to above (Cass. Com. September 13, 2011_ n°10-25533 Belvédère) that a trustee validly appointed under a trust governed by the laws of the State of New York could validly be regarded as a creditor in safeguard proceedings commenced in France. However, while substantial comfort may be derived from the above, France has not ratified the Hague Convention of July 1, 1985 on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition, so that the concept of “trust” has not been generally recognized under French law. References to the Security Agent with respect to security interests granted under French law are references to Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as security agent in France. In relation to the security interests granted under French law, each holder of the Notes has appointed the Security Agent to act as security agent (agent des _sûretés) pursuant to Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code for the purpose of taking, registering,_ managing and enforcing any Collateral granted under French law in the name of the Security Agent for the benefit of such holder of the Notes. All rights and assets received by the Security Agent as security agent (agent des sûretés) when acting in such a capacity will, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the French Civil Code, be part of a separate estate (patrimoine d’affectation) designed to protect the rights of the secured creditors in case of bankruptcy or insolvency of the security agent (agent des sûretés). The security agent regime provided under Articles 2488-6 to 2488-12 of the French Civil Code came into force only on October 1, 2017 and, accordingly, has not been tested to date. Whilst this new regime provides for a protection of the rights and assets received by the Security Agent as security agent (agent des sûretés) in case of various bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings affecting the security agent (agent des sûretés), it is uncertain how the non-French courts of the jurisdiction where bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings of the security agent (agent des sûretés) are conducted will recognize and apply this regime.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

There is no guarantee that the value of the relevant Collateral will be sufficient to enable each of the Issuers to satisfy their obligations under the relevant Notes and the relevant Guarantees. There will be no requirement under the Indentures to provide funds to enhance the value of the Collateral if it is insufficient, though applicable law may provide otherwise. The proceeds of any sale of the Collateral following an event of default with respect to the Notes may not be sufficient to satisfy, and may be substantially less than, amounts due on the relevant Notes. The amount of proceeds realized upon the enforcement of the security interests over the relevant Collateral or in the event of liquidation will depend upon many factors, including, among others, general market and economic conditions, the condition of the market for the relevant Collateral, the ability to sell the relevant Collateral in an orderly sale, the fair value of the relevant Collateral, the timing and manner of the sale, whether or not our business is sold as a going concern, the ability to readily liquidate the Collateral, the availability of buyers and the condition of the relevant Collateral and exchange rates. Further, there may not be any buyer willing and able to purchase our business as a going concern, or willing to buy a significant portion of our assets in the event of an enforcement action. By its nature, some or all the Collateral may not have a readily ascertainable market value or may not be saleable or, if saleable, there may be substantial delays in its disposal. To the extent that liens, security interests and other rights granted to other parties encumber assets owned by the Issuers or the Guarantors, those parties have or may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the property subject to their liens, security interests or other rights that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the relevant Security Agent or investors as holders of the relevant Notes to realize or enforce that Collateral. If the proceeds of any sale of the Collateral are not sufficient to repay all amounts due on the relevant Notes and the relevant Guarantees, investors (to the extent not repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the relevant Collateral) would have only an unsecured claim against the relevant Issuer’s and the relevant Guarantor’s remaining assets. Each of these factors or any challenge to the validity of the Collateral or the intercreditor arrangement governing our creditors’ rights could reduce the proceeds realized upon enforcement of the Collateral.

The existence of any such exceptions, defects, encumbrances, liens, security interests and other imperfections could adversely affect the value of the Collateral securing the Notes, as well as the ability of the relevant Security Agent to realize or foreclose on such Collateral. Furthermore, the ranking of security interests can be affected by a variety of factors, including, among others, the timely satisfaction of perfection requirements or statutory liens. The ability of the relevant Security Agent to enforce on the Collateral located in a particular jurisdiction or governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction is subject to mandatory provisions of the law of such jurisdiction. Enforcement of the Collateral may also be subject to certain statutory limitations and defenses or to limitations contained in the terms of the Security Documents designed to ensure compliance with applicable statutory requirements. The security interests of the relevant Security Agent will be subject to practical problems generally associated with the realization of security interests over property such as the Collateral. For example, the relevant Security Agent may need to obtain the consent of a third party, including in some cases certain regulatory consents, to enforce a security interest. We cannot assure you that the relevant Security Agent will be able to obtain any such consent. We also cannot assure you that the consents of any third parties will be given when required to facilitate a foreclosure on such assets. Accordingly, the relevant Security Agent may not have the ability to foreclose upon those assets, the value of the Collateral may significantly decrease and in any enforcement action, the Collateral would have to be offered first to such party, which could cause delays in the enforcement process or lead to a less competitive bidding process for such assets and thus a lower level of recovery therefrom. In addition, to the extent that any other security interests permitted under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, the Indentures, and other rights encumber the Collateral securing the Notes, those parties may have and may exercise rights and remedies with respect to the relevant Collateral that could adversely affect the value of that Collateral and the ability of the relevant Security Agent to realize, sell or foreclose (in each case in accordance with the relevant Security Documents and the Intercreditor Agreement) on such Collateral.

In France, no lien searches are available for security interests, which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers), pledges over bank accounts (nantissement de comptes bancaires) and pledges over receivables (nantissement de créances). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of the pledges over the securities account in which the shares of Lion Polaris II, and in respect of the Senior Secured Notes only, the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer, Picard International and Picard Surgelés S.A.S., are registered. 65 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

A new set of rules implementing the directive amending ATAD, known as ATAD 2, applies in France, for most of its provisions, to fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2020. According to these new rules set out in Articles 205 B and following of the FTC, the tax-deduction of payments to be made by entities established in France shall be denied if they result in hybrid mismatches involving associated enterprises or structured arrangements. For this purpose: “Hybrid mismatches” refer to a number of situations where, inter alia, payments are deductible for their payors but not included in the taxable income of their (ultimate) beneficiaries, or persons other than the payors may also take a tax-deduction in respect of the same payments, as a result of differences in the tax qualification of payments or entities, and/or in the allocation of payments under the laws of the various jurisdictions involved. “Associated enterprises” refers to situations where (i) an entity owns, directly or indirectly (including together with other persons acting jointly) at least 50% (or 25% in certain cases) of the share capital or voting rights or rights to profits of another entity or (ii) a third person owns, directly or indirectly (including together with other persons acting jointly) at least 50% (or 25% in certain cases) of the share capital or voting rights of each of the two entities or (iii) both entities are members of a same consolidated group or one has a significant influence of the management of the other. “Structured arrangements” refers to arrangements involving a hybrid mismatch where the mismatch outcome is priced into the terms of the arrangements or arrangements that have been designed to produce a hybrid mismatch outcome, unless the parties involved (and their associated enterprises) could not reasonably have been expected to be aware of the hybrid mismatch and did not share in the value of the tax benefit resulting from it. Assuming that the Fixed Rate SSNs do not form part of a structured arrangement, we do not expect that this limitation would apply to interest accruing on the Fixed Rate SSNs. However, we cannot provide any assurance, especially in the absence of published administrative guidelines to date, that this tax legislation would not limit the deductibility of interest on the Fixed Rate SSNs or that the French tax authorities would not disagree with the position we ultimately take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of the indebtedness under the Fixed Rate SSNs. Furthermore, under Article 212 bis of the FTC, net financial expenses incurred during a given fiscal year by a company (or by all members of a consolidated tax group, as the case may be) are deductible only up to the 66 ----- highest of (i) 30% of the “tax EBITDA” of the relevant company or consolidated tax group and (ii) €3.0 million. The “tax EBITDA” corresponds to the taxable income (before offset of tax losses) restated of certain items (such as net financial expenses, net depreciation allowances, net reserves and gains and losses taxable at reduced rates). Net financial expenses exceeding the deduction ceiling can be deducted, up to 75% of their amount, if the company (or the consolidated tax group) is able to demonstrate that its equity ratio (i.e., the ratio between its equity and its gross assets) is higher than or equal to that of the consolidated group to which it belongs, if any (“safeguard clause”). For the purpose of this safeguard clause, the terms “consolidated group” refer to all French and foreign companies whose financial statements are fully consolidated for the preparation of consolidated financial statements within the meaning of Article L. 233-18 of the French Commercial Code or within the meaning of the international accounting standards mentioned in Article L. 233-24 of the same Code. As an exception, in which case the “safeguard clause” is not applicable, if a company (or a consolidated tax group) is “thin-capitalized”, i.e., if the average amount of its related-party indebtedness within the meaning of Article 39.12 of the FTC exceeds 1.5 times the amount of its net assets (as at the opening or the closing of a given fiscal year) and it cannot demonstrate that the level of indebtedness of the consolidated group to which it belongs is higher than its own, its net financial expenses are deductible up to: (a) the highest of (i) 30% of its tax EBITDA and (ii) €3.0 million, multiplied by the following ratio: the average amount of third-party indebtedness, plus average amount of related-party indebtedness that does not exceed 1.5 times the net assets of the company (or of the consolidated tax group) to the average amount of all financial indebtedness of the company (or consolidated tax group); plus (b) the highest of (i) 10% of its tax EBITDA and (ii) €1.0 million, multiplied by the following ratio: the amount of related-party indebtedness that exceeds 1.5 times the net assets of the company (or of the consolidated tax group) to the average amount of all financial indebtedness of the company (or of the consolidated tax group). Non-deductible net financial expenses can be carried forward (indefinitely), as well as unused deduction capacities (over the next five fiscal years). As an exception, if a company (or a consolidated tax group) is thinlycapitalized, only [1]⁄3[rd] of the net financial expenses which are non-deductible in application of (b) above can be carried forward and unused deduction capacities cannot be carried forward. The above-mentioned tax rules may limit our ability to deduct interest accrued on the Fixed Rate SSNs from our taxable results and, as a consequence, may increase our tax burden, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition and reduce the cash flow available to service our indebtedness.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

However, Estonia has since stated that it will not participate. The FTT that was initially proposed had a very broad scope and could, if introduced in that form, apply to certain dealings in the Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances. Primary market transactions referred to in Article 5(c) of Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 were intended to be exempt. In its initial version, the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A financial institution could be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State or (b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State. The FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States. It may therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member States may 67 ----- decide to participate. Following the meeting of the Council of the EU of June 14, 2019, the FTT currently being considered by FTT Participating Member States would be levied on the acquisition of shares of listed companies which have their head office in a member state of the EU and market capitalization in excess of €1 billion on December 1 of the preceding year, rather than on any type of financial instrument. In order to reach a final agreement among the member states participating in the enhanced cooperation, further work in the Council and its preparatory bodies will be required in order to ensure that the competences, rights and obligations of non-participating EU member states are respected. If the proposed directive or any similar tax was adopted and depending on the final terms and scope of the FTT, transactions on the Notes could be subject to higher costs, and the liquidity of the market for the Notes may be diminished.

In the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Senior Secured Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the relevant SSN Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Secured Notes. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers, and whether approvals required to purchase the business would be available to a buyer of the assets. The shares and other Senior Secured Notes Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Secured Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Secured Notes, in part because most of these shares or other assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Most of our assets will not secure the Senior Secured Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Secured Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Senior Secured Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Secured Notes Guarantees, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings because all of the obligations of the subsidiaries whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale.

In addition, in the future, the obligations to provide additional guarantees and grant additional security over assets, whether as a result of the acquisition or creation of future assets or subsidiaries or otherwise, are, in certain circumstances, linked to our obligations under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, subject to certain agreed security principles. To the extent that lenders under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are granted security, the negative pledge in the Senior Secured Notes Indentures may require such security to also be granted for the benefit of holders of the Senior Secured Notes. The agreed security principles set forth in the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement contain a number of limitations on the rights of the lenders to be granted security in certain circumstances.

357,Offerings 2021.md,13,RISK FACTORS,13.4,Additional Risks Related to the Senior Notes,13.4.1,The Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of non-guarantor subsidiaries.,"Some, but not all, of the SN Issuer’s subsidiaries guarantee the Senior Notes, and no operating subsidiaries guarantee the Senior Notes. Unless a subsidiary is a Senior Notes Guarantor, the SN Issuer’s subsidiaries have no obligations to pay amounts due under the Senior Notes or to make funds available for that purpose. Generally, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, non-guarantor subsidiaries (including Lion Polaris II, which is a Senior Secured Notes Guarantor, the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer, which is also a Floating Rate SSN Guarantor, Picard Surgelés and Picard International), including lenders under bank financing agreements, are entitled to 73 ----- payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before these assets are made available for distribution to the SN Issuer or any guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any non-guarantor subsidiary becomes insolvent, is liquidated, reorganized or dissolved or is otherwise wound up other than as part of a solvent transaction: - the creditors of the SN Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors (including the holders of the Senior Notes) will have no right to proceed against the assets of such subsidiary; and - creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of the assets of such subsidiary before the SN Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor, as a direct or indirect shareholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary. As such, the Senior Notes, each Senior Notes Guarantee and each intercompany proceeds loan are structurally subordinated to the creditors (including trade creditors) and any preferred stockholders of our non-guarantor subsidiaries. Moreover, the guarantees of the Senior Notes are subordinated to the Senior Notes Guarantors’ obligations under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement, their Senior Secured Notes Guarantees and any future senior debt of such guarantors.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

This senior debt includes the Senior Secured Notes and the guarantees under the Senior Secured Notes, the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility and certain hedging arrangements. Although the Senior Notes Indenture contains restrictions on the ability of the Senior Notes Guarantors to incur additional debt, any additional debt incurred may be substantial and senior to the guarantees. For a summary of the terms of, and subordination provisions relating to, the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees, see “Description of the Senior Notes—Subordination of the Note Guarantees”. Upon any payment or distribution to creditors of a Senior Notes Guarantor in respect of an insolvency event, the holders of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor will be entitled to be paid in full from the assets of such Senior Notes Guarantor before any payment may be made pursuant to such guarantee. Until the senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor is paid in full, any distribution to which holders of the Senior Notes would be entitled but for the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement shall instead be made to holders of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor. As a result, in the event of insolvency of a Senior Notes Guarantor, holders of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor may recover more, ratably, than the holders of Senior Notes, in respect of the Senior Notes Guarantor’s guarantee in respect thereof. In addition, the subordination provisions in the Intercreditor Agreement relating to the guarantees provide: - for customary turnover provisions by the Senior Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes for the benefit of the holders of senior debt of such Senior Notes Guarantor; - that if a payment default on any senior debt of a Senior Notes Guarantor has occurred and is continuing, such Senior Notes Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of its Senior Notes Guarantee until such default is cured or waived; - that if any event of default occurs and is continuing on any senior indebtedness that permits the holders thereof to accelerate its maturity and the Senior Notes Trustee receives a notice of such default, such Senior Notes Guarantor may not make any payment in respect of the Senior Notes, or pursuant to its guarantee, until the earliest of the waiver or cure of such default, 179 days after the date on which the applicable payment blockage notice is received, the expiration of the standstill period in respect of taking enforcement action, and the taking of any permitted enforcement action; and - that the holders of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Trustee are prohibited, without the prior consent of the majority senior creditors, from taking any enforcement action in relation to such guarantee, except in certain circumstances. 74 ----- The Senior Notes Indenture will also provide that, except under very limited circumstances, only the Senior Notes Security Agent will have standing to bring an enforcement action in respect of the Senior Notes and the Senior Notes Guarantees. Moreover, the Intercreditor Agreement and the Senior Notes Indenture will restrict the rights of holders of the Senior Notes to initiate insolvency proceedings or take legal actions against each of the Senior Notes Guarantors and by accepting any Senior Note, each such holder will be deemed to have agreed to these restrictions. As a result of these restrictions, holders of the Senior Notes will have limited remedies and recourse under the guarantees in the event of a default by the SN Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor, see “Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes and the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement are secured by first-ranking security interests in all of the Senior Notes Collateral and the proceeds of any sale of such Senior Notes Collateral on enforcement will be applied first to repay borrowings under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging obligations and the Senior Secured Notes. Consequently, you may not be able to recover on such Collateral because the lenders under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility, certain hedging counterparties and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of such Collateral. Under the Intercreditor Agreement and the Security Documents, the Senior Secured Notes, the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility, certain future indebtedness and certain hedging obligations are secured by firstranking security interests in all of the Senior Notes Collateral and the proceeds of any sale of such Senior Notes Collateral on enforcement or in a distressed disposal will be applied first to repay all debt of the lenders under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the creditors of certain future indebtedness and the creditors under certain hedging obligations on super-senior priority basis and to the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and the creditors of certain future indebtedness on a senior basis. Consequently, holders of the Senior Notes may not be able to recover on such Collateral because the holders of the lenders under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility, the creditors of certain future indebtedness, the creditors under certain hedging obligations and the holders of the Senior Secured Notes will have a prior claim on all proceeds from any enforcement of such Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Senior Notes and the related guarantees will not be secured by any assets pledged by the French entities. In the event of an enforcement of the pledges in respect of the Senior Notes, the proceeds from the sale of the assets underlying the pledges may not be sufficient to satisfy the SN Issuer’s obligations with respect to the Senior Notes. The value of the assets underlying the pledges will also depend on many factors, including, among other things, whether or not the business is sold as a going concern, the ability to sell the assets in an orderly sale, the condition of the economies in which operations are located and the availability of buyers and whether approvals required to purchase the business would be available to a buyer of the assets. In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement will provide that, in the event of any distribution of the proceeds from the sale of the 75 ----- Senior Notes Collateral, the lenders under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain hedging obligations on a super-senior basis, the holders of the Senior Secured Notes and certain other indebtedness ranking pari passu with the Senior Secured Notes and the holders of certain indebtedness ranking junior to the Senior Secured Notes but in priority to the Senior Notes will be entitled to receive from such distribution payment in full in cash before the holders of the Senior Notes will be entitled to receive any payment from such distribution. The shares and other Senior Notes Collateral that are pledged or assigned for the benefit of the holders of the Senior Notes may provide for only limited repayment of the Senior Notes, in part because most of these shares or other assets may not be liquid and their value to other parties may be less than their value to us. Likewise, we cannot assure you that the Senior Notes Collateral will be saleable or, if saleable, that there will not be substantial delays in the liquidation thereof. Most of our assets will not secure the Senior Notes and it is possible that the value of the Senior Notes Collateral will not be sufficient to cover the amount of indebtedness secured by such Senior Notes Collateral. With respect to any shares of our subsidiaries pledged to secure the Senior Notes, such shares may also have limited value in the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar proceedings because all of the obligations of the subsidiaries whose shares have been pledged must first be satisfied, leaving little or no remaining assets in the pledged entity. As a result, the holders of the Senior Notes secured by a pledge of the shares of these entities may not recover anything of value in the case of an enforcement sale. In addition, the value of this Senior Notes Collateral may decline over time. The Senior Notes Indenture will also permit the granting of certain liens other than those in favor of the holders of the Senior Notes on the Senior Notes Collateral. To the extent that holders of other secured indebtedness or third parties enjoy liens, including statutory liens, whether or not permitted by the Senior Notes Indenture or the security documents, such holders or third parties may have rights and remedies with respect to the Senior Notes Collateral that, if exercised, could reduce the proceeds available to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Notes. Moreover, if additional notes under the Senior Notes Indenture are issued by the SN Issuer, holders of such additional notes would benefit from the same Senior Notes Collateral as the holders of the existing Senior Notes, thereby diluting your ability to benefit from the liens on the Senior Notes Collateral.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

A pledge over the shares of a stock company (société par actions) governed by French law is a pledge over the relevant securities account (nantissement de compte de titres financiers) in which the shares of such company are registered. In France, no lien searches are available for security interests which are not registered, such as pledges over securities accounts (nantissements de comptes de titres financiers). As a result, no assurance can be given on the priority of a pledge over a securities account in which the shares of such a company are registered. The creation and enforcement of second ranking pledges over certain assets (such as receivables or securities account) has not been tested before French courts, and there can be no assurance that second ranking pledges over such assets would be upheld if tested. Accordingly, there is a risk that a second ranking pledge over such assets may be held void or unenforceable by a French court. Although the security interest may be granted on a lower than second-ranking basis due to applicable local law, pursuant to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Senior Notes and/or the obligations of the Senior Notes Guarantors under the Senior Notes Guarantees will be deemed to be secured by the applicable security documents on a second-ranking basis. Therefore, the ranking of the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Senior Notes in such jurisdictions will depend on the enforceability of the Intercreditor Agreement. As a result, if the Intercreditor Agreement or the relevant provisions thereof were found to be invalid or held to be unenforceable for any reason, or if an administrator refuses to give effect to it, the holders would not benefit from such second-priority treatment and the security interests granted in favor of holders of the Senior Notes in these jurisdictions would rank behind and be subordinated to any second-priority security interests. 77 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The summary historical consolidated financial information of the SN Issuer as of and for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, has been derived from the audited consolidated financial statements of the SN Issuer as of and for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, unless otherwise stated. Since April 1, 2019, the Group has applied IFRS 16 in accordance with the modified retrospective approach. The application of this standard significantly increases the Group’s EBITDA. The Group has chosen to apply IFRS 16 using the simplified retrospective approach as of April 1, 2019 and the March 31, 2019 financial statements and the March 31, 2018 financial statements have consequently not been restated. Prior to the adoption of this standard, rent expenses were recorded in the line item “other purchases and external expenses”. Following the adoption of this new standard, the Group has recognized right-of-use assets for its eligible stores and vehicles, which are depreciated over the lease term, depreciation charges being recorded in the line item “depreciation and amortization” of the Group income statement, and a corresponding lease liability initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that have not been paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. As a result of the significant changes caused by the application of IFRS 16, the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for periods prior to the year ended March 31, 2020 may not be comparable to financial information for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021. In December 2019, the IFRS interpretation committee (“IFRS IC”) published its decision clarifying the rules for determining the term of leases within the scope of IFRS 16. The application of this IFRS IC interpretation is a change in accounting method requiring a retrospective calculation of the impacts as of April 1, 2019 (applying the same incremental borrowing rates table as the one initially used by the Group at the first time application date, to the newly determined lease terms). The Group applied the IFRS IC interpretation relating to the assessment of leases with retroactive effect from April 1, 2019 and, consequently, in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, the comparative columns as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020 were recast (indicated as “restated”) to reflect a decision by the IFRS IC relating to the classification of leases under IFRS 16 (Leases). Therefore, the comparative financial information as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020 in the Audited Financial Statements for the year ended March 31, 2021, is not directly comparable to the financial information in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020._ 82 ----- _The following tables should be read in conjunction with “Use of Proceeds”, “Capitalization”, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, “Description of the Floating Senior Secured Notes”, “Description of the Fixed Senior Secured Notes”, “Description of the Senior Notes” and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum._",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.1,Introduction Our Company,17.1.1,,"We are the leading retailer of frozen food products in France, based on sales, and are a pioneer in the sector. In calendar year 2020, we had an approximate 20.6% market share (including ice cream products) of the approximately €8.2 billion French frozen food market according to internal data and industry publications (prepared by Nielsen Retailers Panel and Syndigel). We offer our customers a total of approximately 1,250 different frozen food SKUs (or an average of approximately 1,000 SKUs per store), including unprocessed meat, fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables and bakery products, as well as a full range of ready-made starters, main courses, desserts and ice cream at various price points. We introduced the concept of premium quality, appetizing frozen food to French consumers when we opened our first store in Paris in 1974. Since then, we have continued to develop the market for frozen food products in France by transforming the way the French public perceives and consumes frozen food. 85 ----- We sell products under our own Picard brand (approximately 95% of our sales of frozen products during the year ended March 31, 2021), as well as under a few national and international brands, such as, for example, Häagen-Dazs, Charal and Ben & Jerry’s. In France, our Picard products are sold almost exclusively through our store network (including through our new Click & Collect program) as well as through Home Delivery, which extends throughout France due to our partnerships with courier companies, including “Chronofresh”, a Chronopost subsidiary. We have successfully expanded our network over the years, and we opened an average of 40 new stores per year from the year ended March 31, 2002 to the year ended March 31, 2012 and an average of 24 new stores per year from April 2012 to March 31, 2021 (either directly-operated stores or through franchises in France and abroad). As of March 31, 2021, we had 1,051 stores in France (including two franchised stores in Corsica, two franchised stores in the French West Indies, ten franchised stores in La Réunion, two franchised stores in New Caledonia and 22 franchised stores in mainland France), 14 stores in Belgium, 15 franchised stores in Japan, one store in Luxembourg and ten franchised stores in Scandinavia. We also sell our products abroad through various additional channels. For instance, we sell products in the United Kingdom through the grocery home delivery service Ocado and the grocery store Marks & Spencer and in Singapore through a partnership with RedMart. Additionally, through a partnership with Albert Heijn, a number of Picard products are offered in certain Albert Heijn supermarkets and hypermarkets in the Netherlands. Since August 2018, a joint venture partner has operated the network of stores in Sweden, which we previously owned, and also sells our products in ICA stores. We outsource the production of all of our products to approximately 260 different suppliers in calendar year 2020, allowing us to concentrate on quality control and new product research, development and innovation. We continuously review our product offering and introduce on average approximately 250 new SKUs a year. During the year ended March 31, 2021, we continued our innovation efforts and we introduced 287 new SKUs (representing approximately 23% of our 1,250 frozen food SKUs), including exclusive national brands and new SKUs for thematic campaigns. As a result of our innovation efforts, many of our products are unique to us, which we believe attracts customers to our stores. We have successfully increased our Total retail France sales over the last 10 years from €1,181.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2011 to €1,646.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% despite certain economic and industry challenges during that period. For the year ended March 31, 2021, sales in France, which include sales from our directly-operated stores as well as Home Delivery and sales to our franchisees located in mainland France, Corsica, the French West Indies, La Réunion and New Caledonia accounted for 97.6% of our total sales, with sales in Belgium, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Singapore and the United Kingdom generating the remaining balance. Our Total retail France sales were €1,646.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, increasing by 15.5% compared to the same period in the prior year, which was due, in part, to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on Nielsen data (including VAT) and their commercial calendar, we believe we outperformed the French frozen food market by approximately 600 basis points in the year ended March 31, 2021 (with our revenue growing by approximately 15.2%, as compared to market growth in the broader French frozen food market of approximately 8.8%).",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors that Affect our Results of Operations,17.2.1,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Our performance has been significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis has had a positive impact on the frozen food market, frozen food being considered as both safer and more convenient in such period. In addition, customers have tended to avoid hypermarkets to shop in smaller stores, closer to their houses and with fewer social interactions. Finally, the food retail sector has benefitted from the closure of restaurants, workplace cafeterias and other out-of-home food services during lockdown periods. These trends have clearly benefitted our business. We estimate that the positive impact of the pandemic on our turnover for the year ended March 31, 2020 was approximately €35 million and such positive effect has then continued and significantly affected our turnover for the year ended March 31, 2021. However, the end of the COVID-19 pandemic is expected to have a negative impact on our results of operations, as compared to our results of operations during the course of the pandemic. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered an economic recession in France and creates much uncertainty regarding economic and social conditions for future periods both in France and the other markets in which we operate.

We opened 15 new stores in mainland France in the year ended March 31, 2020 (including four franchised stores) and 17 new stores in mainland France in the year ended March 31, 2021 (including three franchised stores). As of March 31, 2021, the store network increased to 1,013 directly-operated stores in mainland France, 14 stores in Belgium and one store in Luxembourg, as well as 22 additional franchised stores in mainland France, two in Corsica, two in the French West Indies, ten in La Réunion, two in New Caledonia, 15 in Japan and ten in Scandinavia. We also entered into a commercial partnership with Ocado, a grocery home delivery service, and Marks & Spencer in the United Kingdom. In August 2018, we sold our Swedish operations to our joint-venture partner and entered into a five-year franchise agreement, whereby the franchisee will continue to sell our products in Sweden with a leading Swedish supermarket, ICA. In addition, we sell Picard-branded products in Italy through a commercial agreement with an Italian retailer, which offers our products in 45 stores in Italy. This contract is effective until December 31, 2021. The change in scale due to the opening of new stores and our international and franchise expansion affects the comparability of our results during those periods by increasing both revenues and expenses. We expect to continue our strategic expansion into locations that meet our demographic and other commercial criteria. Given the sustained expansion of our network over time, our management finds it useful to analyze sales growth in France (excluding Home Delivery and franchised stores) on a “like-for-like” basis in order to understand the evolution of the results of our existing stores, excluding the effects of network expansion and store closings. Our management also uses two key performance indicators, which are total number of tickets and average basket size. “Total number of tickets” measures the number of sales transactions that take place in a given period, while “average basket size” measures the average euro value of all such transactions. Despite our expansion, our average sales per store at existing stores have not been negatively affected during the periods under review by store openings, mainly due to the relatively limited number of openings as compared to our total store network and the offsetting positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the expansion of our store network in the past (and our expected continued expansion in the future) may have a greater impact and affect comparisons of our results of operations because of the “ramp-up period”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.2,Factors that Affect our Results of Operations,17.2.3,Economic and social conditions,"Sales have historically been affected by overall macroeconomic conditions. During periods of slow GDP growth, the value of our average basket has typically declined, as consumers increased the share of less expensive products in their shopping baskets and reduced the number of products purchased per basket. Reflecting the stability of the broader French frozen food market, our French stores like-for-like sales growth has historically been resilient, generating a compound annual growth rate of 2.1% from the year ended March 31, 2011 to the year ended March 31, 2021. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business”. We are exposed to economic and other trends that could adversely impact our operations in France, Belgium, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Singapore and the United Kingdom. Over the past few years, we have seen our average basket size in France slightly declining, from €21.5 for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €21.1 for the year ended March 31, 2019. On average, our customers have purchased more of the less expensive SKUs and reduced the number of SKUs purchased. This trend can be explained by (i) the increasing proportion of individual ready meals in our product offering and our decision to promote snacking consumption (for example, with our Snackbar offer and affordable lunch meal solutions), (ii) the increasing number of stores offering more convenience and permitting customers to buy more frequently and less at the same time and (iii) an overall trend in the market (due to high competition and an increase in the number of retailers). The impact of this trend was balanced by our ability to maintain traffic in our stores and increase the total number of tickets in France, from 63.9 million to 64.0 million during the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively. We have been able to maintain traffic in our stores through product innovation, on which we place a special focus and the reinforcement of marketing and promotional campaigns. Over the past few years, we have devoted additional resources to advertising and promotion campaigns such as 87 ----- the “Dix jours Picard”, which familiarize our customers with the variety of our product range, have added new commercial operations such as “Hello America”, and have adapted our commercial calendar (for example, in early December we have a special promotion “Le très bon week-end”) to remain attractive in an evolving market. As a result, we have maintained our French stores like-for-like sales growth performance in a challenging economic environment. The average basket size did increase in 2020 and 2021 due, in part, to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In calendar year 2018, our business was negatively impacted by the “Yellow Vest” protests in France, which peaked on Saturdays during the Christmas period, which are traditionally the busiest days in our most profitable period. During this time, public morale was low and the French economy was negatively impacted. On several occasions, the protests and riots restricted physical access to our stores, most of which are located in or near city centers and metropolitan areas. As a result, the year ended March 31, 2019 was one of only two years since 1986 where we experienced negative revenue growth, our revenue decreasing by 1.9% compared to the prior year. More recently, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, customers have changed their habits in a way that has been favorable to us: (i) they have reduced the number of food retailers they visit and (ii) they have discovered or rediscovered certain categories, such as meat and seafood, carrying a high value per SKU, triggering an increase in the average basket compared to pre-COVID levels. Any deterioration in the economic and social environment could negatively impact the ability of our customers to afford our premium products and lead to increased competition from hard discounters.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Sales of frozen food, including seafood, frozen vegetables and complete frozen meals tend to be higher during the winter months, and December sales have historically been approximately double those of other months due to Christmas and New Year’s celebrations. We offer a particularly varied and innovative range of festive products during this period that translates into significantly higher sales for such period (with increases in both average basket and number of tickets). As a result, our cash on balance sheet has historically been at its highest level in December, after the Christmas period, and has historically decreased in January and February, when our trade payables become due. Sales have historically increased again, albeit at a significantly lower pace, around Valentine’s Day, due to our strong marketing campaigns and during Easter and decreased during the summer months as declines in sales in urban areas are only partially offset by increases at summer vacation destinations. At the end of the summer vacation period, sales have historically increased slightly as customers tend to restock their freezers upon returning home. In addition, because Easter falls on a different date each year, some financial years may include two Easters while others may include no Easter at all. For example, we experienced a positive calendar effect during the year ended March 31, 2020, as there was an Easter holiday and an additional day due to a leap year during that period. For these reasons, sequential quarterly and annual comparisons may not be a good indication of our comparative performance between two periods or how we may perform in the future. If seasonal fluctuations are greater than anticipated, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Moreover, as we expand internationally, we will experience higher costs in the absence of cost savings derived from existing common platforms and shared resources. In the past, we have proactively managed our cost base. However, certain expenses, such as rents, energy or prices of raw materials, are largely outside our control.

In France, sales of goods increased by €256.6 million, or 17.4%, from €1,474.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to €1,730.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2021. French like-for-like sales increased by 14.6% over the period, as a result of a 13.7% increase in the average basket and a slight increase of 0.7% in the number of tickets. Our performance was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the year ended March 31, 2021. During the first lockdown, our average basket sharply increased, while the number of tickets significantly declined as people tended to purchase more at the same time but shopped less frequently. The number of tickets then started to return to pre-pandemic levels after the end of the first lockdown and normalized in June, while the average basket size remained high. After a dynamic second and third quarter, the increase in like-for-like sales remained high during the fourth quarter reaching 7.1% compared with the three months ended March 31, 2020, with a high average basket size increasing by 3.8% compared with the three months ended March 31, 2020, while the number of tickets increased by 3.2% compared with the three months ended March 31, 2020. During the lockdowns, our activity has been supported by several factors, notably the fact that Picard operates convenience stores and smaller stores, which are closer to customers’ houses and involve fewer social interactions and the closure of restaurants and out-of-home food services. After the lockdowns, Picard customers continued to purchase a higher number of SKUs per visit, notably seafood and meat. Such categories were less dynamic prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, but customers have rediscovered the attractiveness of Picard’s offering during the lockdowns and continued to make purchases thereafter. During the year, Picard promoted its digital platforms to meet the evolving needs of our customers. Consequently, our home delivery channel increased its sales by 86.7%. During this time, we also launched our new Click & Collect program. Sales in Belgium and Luxembourg increased by €4.8 million, from €16.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to €20.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, due to the increase in like-for-like sales notably as a result of the positive COVID-19 impact, in spite of the closure of a loss-making store in Belgium in January 2020. The activity was also very dynamic for the rest of the Group. Sales in other locations with our partners and franchisees increased from €17.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to €22.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, in spite of the closure of our activity in Switzerland in January 2020.

Employee profit sharing increased by €6.4 million, from €18.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to €24.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, following higher contractual profit sharing (“inte´ressement”), which is computed based on sales performance, and higher legal profit sharing (“participation”), which is computed based on our French income before tax. Other personnel expenses increased by €2.1 million, from €44.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to €46.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, mainly driven by a €1.2 million increase in social security costs, following the increase in salaries, and partially offset by a reversal of the 2017 URSSAF provision (following the expiration of the three-year claims period with no audit by the relevant authorities in France). As a proportion of sales of goods, social security costs decreased from 2.5% for the year ended March 31, 2020 to 2.2% for the year ended March 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

(0.0) — (1) The financial information for the year ended March 31, 2019 has not been restated to reflect the impact of IFRS 16 and may not be comparable to financial information for the year ended March 31, 2020. (2) The financial information for the year ended March 31, 2020 was restated to reflect the impact of a decision by the IFRS Interpretation Committee (IFRS IC) relating to the classification of leases under IFRS 16 (Leases). _Sales of goods_ Our sales of goods increased by €84.6 million, or 5.9%, from €1,422.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €1,507.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. In France, sales of goods increased by €83.6 million, or 6.0%, from €1,390.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €1,474.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. French like-for-like sales increased by 5.2% over the period, as a result of a 2.6% increase in the total number of tickets combined with a 2.5% increase in the average basket size. The year ended March 31, 2020 experienced a positive calendar effect, mainly explained by the positioning of the Easter shopping period in the three months ended June 30, 2020 and not in the three months ended June 30, 2019 and by the leap year effect. As adjusted to exclude such calendar effect, French like-for-like sales would have increased by an estimated 4.7%. In addition, our financial performance was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which had an estimated impact on our sales of goods of approximately €35 million. Excluding this effect and calendar effect, French like-for-like sales would have increased by approximately 2.1%. Sales in Belgium and Luxembourg increased by €0.6 million, or 3.9%, from €15.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €16.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, due to the increase in like-for-like sales notably as a result of the positive COVID-19 impact, and despite the closure of two loss-making stores in Belgium in July 2018 and in January 2020. Sales in Scandinavia decreased by €0.6 million from €5.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €5.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 following the sale of our Swedish operations in August 2018 and the change in our business model in Sweden, partially offset by the opening of our first franchised store in Norway. Our commercial agreement enables us to maintain our presence in Sweden and expand in Norway, through a distribution channel that adds value to our business, even if the revenue derived from this activity is initially lower than the revenue generated prior to this divestment. 94 ----- Additionally, sales to franchised stores and partners located in Switzerland, Japan, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy increased by €1.0 million, from €11.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €12.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. In particular, sales in the United Kingdom under the partnership with Ocado increased by €0.5 million, from €3.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 to €3.9 million in the year ended March 31, 2020, following mainly an increase in the number of SKUs available. In addition, sales in Japan increased by €1.7 million, from €2.1 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 to €3.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2020, following the increase in the number of franchised stores opened by our partner Aeon. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in sales in the Netherlands and in Switzerland following the closure of franchised stores in January 2020. _Cost of goods sold_ Our cost of goods sold increased by €49.9 million, or 6.3%, from €797.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €847.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to the increased volume of goods purchased from our suppliers in January and February 2021, as our sales increased during the year for the reasons described above, and particularly as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales slightly increased from 56.1% for the year ended March 31, 2019 to 56.2% for the year ended March 31, 2020. _Gross profit_ Our gross profit increased by €34.7 million, or 5.6%, from €625.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €659.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, as a result of higher sales mainly due to the COVID-19 pandemic period. Gross profit as a percentage of sales of goods slightly decreased from 43.9% for the year ended March 31, 2019 to 43.8% for the year ended March 31, 2020, notably due to the presence of the Easter shopping period in April 2019 and not in April 2018, during which the level of promotion is higher, the change in our business model in Sweden, from an own store model to a franchise model, as well as by the success of our promotional campaigns in October, November and December, that contributed to an increase in sales. In addition, sales of raw products (mainly meat and fish) during the COVID-19 pandemic strongly increased, with slightly lower margin than prepared meals. _Other operating income_ Other operating income decreased by €3.6 million, from €8.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €5.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to €3.9 million of income recorded last year, as we obtained a refund from the French tax administration of a reassessment following an adjustment on a tax on fish (“Contribution pour une peˆche durable”). In addition, during the year ended March 31, 2019, we also recorded €0.7 million in compensation received from the sale of energy certificates. During the year ended March 31, 2020, we recorded €1.0 million of income corresponding to an indemnity received in connection with a store eviction. _Other purchases and external expenses_ Our other purchases and external expenses decreased by €47.1 million, or 19.5%, from €241.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €194.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This decrease was primarily due to the adoption of IFRS 16 as of April 1, 2019, that had a €58.7 million positive impact. The Group has chosen to apply IFRS 16 using the simplified retrospective approach as of April 1, 2019 and the March 31, 2019 financial statements and the March 31, 2018 financial statements have consequently not been restated. Prior to the adoption of this standard, rent expenses were recorded in the line item “other purchases and external expenses”. Following the adoption of this new standard, the Group has recognized right-of-use assets for its eligible stores and vehicles, which are depreciated over the lease term, depreciation charges being recorded in the line item “depreciation and amortization” of the Group income statement. Excluding the impact of IFRS 16, other purchases and external expenses increased by €11.0 million, or 4.6%, mainly due to higher logistics costs, due to the strong increase in sales, higher energy costs, following the increase in the price of electricity costs, and the increase in advertising expenses due to TV ads launched in July, September and January. These increases were partially offset by savings in maintenance costs. _Taxes other than on income_ Taxes other than on income increased from €16.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €17.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. Taxes other than on income as a percentage of sales of goods remained flat at 1.2% for the year ended March 31, 2019 and March 31, 2020. 95 ----- _Personnel expenses_ Personnel expenses increased by €14.2 million, or 8.0%, from €177.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €191.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. As a percentage of sales of goods, personnel expenses increased from 12.4% for the year ended March 31, 2019 to 12.7% for the year ended March 31, 2020. Wages and salaries increased by €8.8 million, or 7.4%, from €119.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €128.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, as a result of annual salary increases in France and Belgium, the expansion of our store network, and a non-recurring COVID-19 bonus of €4.5 million paid to employees in our stores, partially offset by the sale of our Swedish operations in August 2018. As a percentage of sales of goods, wages and salaries slightly increased from 8.4% for the year ended March 31, 2019 to 8.5% for the year ended March 31, 2020. Excluding the non-recurring bonus, wages and salaries increased by €4.3 million, or 3.6%, from €119.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €123.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. Employee profit sharing increased from €15.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €18.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, following the increase in contractual profit sharing (“inte´ressement”), reflecting the improvement of the store commercial performance throughout the year. Other personnel expenses increased from €41.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €44.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. The CICE tax credit was recorded as a reduction of social security costs and amounted to €4.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This tax credit has been repealed and converted into a direct reduction of social security charges since January 1, 2019. Social security costs (net of CICE in 2019) increased by €2.3 million from €35.1 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 to €37.4 million in the year March 31, 2020. As a proportion of sales of goods, social security costs (net of CICE in 2019) remained flat at 2.5% for the year ended March 31, 2019 and for the year ended March 31, 2020. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses decreased by €1.7 million, from €5.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €3.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. During the year ended March 31, 2019, we recorded exceptional charges relating to the sale of our Swedish operations corresponding to a €0.9 million impairment charge and the derecognition of the minority interests in an amount of €2.1 million. During the year ended March 31, 2020, we recorded a €1.1 million loss on bad debt following the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings in respect of our franchisee in Switzerland, which was operating six stores until early January 2020 when such stores were closed. _EBITDA_ EBITDA increased by €64.9 million, or 33.6%, from €193.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €258.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. As a percentage of sales of goods, EBITDA increased from 13.6% for the year ended March 31, 2019 to 17.1% for the year ended March 31, 2020. Excluding the positive impact of the adoption of IFRS 16 in the year ended March 31, 2020, our EBITDA increased by €6.9 million, or 3.6%, from €193.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 to €200.2 million (Pre-IFRS 16 EBITDA) in the year ended March 31, 2020, as a result of the factors discussed above. _Depreciation, amortization and provisions allowances_ Depreciation and amortization increased by €56.7 million, from €37.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €94.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the €56.5 million amortization charge on the right of use asset recognized following the adoption of IFRS 16. Other depreciation and amortization decreased by €0.5 million, from €37.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €37.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. As a percentage of sales of goods, depreciation and amortization increased from 2.6% for the year ended March 31, 2019 to 6.3% for the year ended March 31, 2020. _Operating profit_ Operating profit increased by €8.2 million, or 5.3%, from €155.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019, to €164.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, as a result of the combination of the factors described above. As a percentage of sales of goods, operating profit remained flat with 11.0% for the year ended March 31, 2019 and 10.9% for the year ended March 31, 2020. 96 ----- _Finance costs_ Finance costs increased by €5.9 million, from €57.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €63.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This increase in finance costs was mainly due to €4.0 million in interest expense relating to lease commitments recognized following the adoption of IFRS 16. This increase was partially offset by a €0.3 million decrease in foreign exchange losses following the sale of our Swedish business. _Income before tax_ Income before tax decreased by €2.9 million, from €98.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €95.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, mainly as a result of the increase in operating profit, which was partly offset by higher finance costs following the adoption of IFRS 16 and the share of profit in associate decreasing to a higher loss. As a percentage of sales of goods, income before tax decreased from 6.9% for the year ended March 31, 2019 to 6.3% for the year ended March 31, 2020. _Income tax expense_ Income tax expense increased by €11.1 million, from a charge of €34.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to a charge of €45.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. Income tax expense during the year ended March 31, 2019 included non-recurring deferred tax income of €10.3 million relating to the recognition of deferred tax assets on non-deductible interest expenses from previous periods. In accordance with thincapitalization rules applicable in France, interest expenses in an amount of €35.0 million were not deducted from the tax results in prior periods but were carried forward. These unused tax credits were not recognized as deferred tax assets considering uncertainties as to whether such deductible interest expenses could be utilized against taxable results in the future. However, following changes in the capital structure resulting from the financing in December 2017, the Group believes it will now be able to deduct these interest expenses from its future taxable results. Therefore, we recognized the deferred tax assets corresponding to the carried-forward deductible interest expenses. Excluding the non-recurring effects on deferred taxes in the year ended March 31, 2019, income tax expense increased by €1.7 million, from €45.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €46.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. _Net income_ Net income decreased by €14.0 million, from €63.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €49.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2020, as a result of the factors described above. 97 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

(1.5) (0.0) _Sales of goods_ Our sales of goods decreased by €26.9 million, or 1.9%, from €1,449.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €1,422.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. In France, sales of goods decreased by €24.4 million, or 1.7%, from €1,414.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €1,390.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. French like-for-like sales decreased by 2.9% over the period, as a result of a 1.1% decrease in the total number of tickets combined with a 1.9% decrease in the average basket size. This decrease in French like-for-like sales was partially due to a negative calendar effect estimated at 1.1%, mainly explained by the occurrence of both Easter 2017 and Easter 2018 during the year ended March 31, 2018, whereas the year ended March 31, 2019 comprised no Easter. Furthermore, as adjusted to exclude such calendar effect, French like-for-like sales would have declined by an estimated 1.8%. This decline in sales was particularly due to the second half of the year, which had been marked by social protests and weakened consumer confidence in France. In calendar year 2018, our business was negatively impacted by the “Yellow Vest” protests in France, which peaked on Saturdays during the Christmas period, which are traditionally the busiest days in our most profitable period. During this time, public morale was low and the French economy was negatively impacted. On several occasions, the protests and riots restricted physical access to our stores, most of which are located in or near city centers and metropolitan areas. Sales in Belgium and Luxembourg decreased by €1.0 million, or 6.1%, from €16.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €15.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2019, due to the decrease in like-for-like sales. Sales in Sweden decreased by €4.1 million from €9.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €5.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2019, following the change in our business model in August 2018 described above, as the revenue at wholesale prices derived from our new partnership is lower than the revenue generated from retail sales prior to the divestment. Additionally, sales to franchised stores and partners located in Switzerland, Japan, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Italy increased by €2.6 million, from €8.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to 98 ----- €11.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. In particular, sales in the United Kingdom under the partnership with Ocado increased by €1.0 million, from €2.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 to €3.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2019, following mainly an increase in the number of SKUs available. In addition, sales in Japan increased by €0.5 million, from €1.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 to €2.1 million in the year ended March 31, 2019, as our partner continued to open stores over the period. Finally, sales generated with Albert Heijn in the Netherlands increased by €1.0 million, from €1.1 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 to €2.1 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 reflecting the full year impact of sales in the year ended March 31, 2019. _Cost of goods sold_ Our cost of goods sold decreased by €16.1 million, or 2.0%, from €813.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €797.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019, primarily due to a decreased volume of goods purchased from our suppliers. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales remained flat at 56.1% for the year ended March 31, 2018 and for the year ended March 31, 2019. _Gross Profit_ Our gross profit decreased by €10.8 million, or 1.7%, from €636.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €625.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2019, as a result of lower sales. Gross profit as a percentage of sales of goods remained flat at 43.9% for the year ended March 31, 2018 and for the year ended March 31, 2019. _Other operating income_ Other operating income increased by €4.0 million, from €4.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €8.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to €3.9 million of income recorded during the year ended March 31, 2019 in connection with a tax audit that took place in 2012 regarding the years ended March 31, 2009 to March 31, 2011. During the year ended March 31, 2014, we had paid the corresponding tax reassessment on a tax on fish. We had challenged the position of the tax administration and, following a favorable ruling of the French Supreme Court (“Conseil d’Etat”), we obtained in August 2018 confirmation of the refund by the French tax administration. The refund of the total amount was effectively obtained in October 2018. The amount corresponding to the tax refund (€3.2 million) was recorded in our accounts for the year ended March 31, 2019, as the French tax administration had confirmed the refund prior to the completion of the accounts for the reporting period. Accrued interest and late payment penalties (€0.7 million) were only determined at the time of receipt of the payment and were recorded in our accounts for the year ended March 31, 2019. In addition, during the year ended March 31, 2019, we also recorded €0.7 million in compensation received from the sale of energy certificates. _Other purchases and external expenses_ Our other purchases and external expenses increased by €1.6 million, or 0.7%, from €239.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €241.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This increase was primarily due to higher rents and energy costs resulting mainly from the expansion of our store network in France combined with higher indexes and prices, as well as higher logistics costs following the increase in gasoline prices and renegotiations of certain suppliers’ terms of purchase. These effects were partially offset by lower maintenance, as well as lower advertising expenses, due to the absence of Easter during the year ended March 31, 2019. Other purchases and external expenses as a percentage of sales of goods increased from 16.5% for the year ended March 31, 2018 to 17.0% for the year ended March 31, 2019. _Taxes other than on income_ Taxes other than on income decreased from €16.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €16.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. Taxes other than on income as a percentage of sales of goods remained flat at 1.2% for the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019. _Personnel expenses_ Personnel expenses increased by €1.5 million, or 0.9%, from €175.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €177.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. As a percentage of sales of goods, personnel expenses increased from 12.1% for the year ended March 31, 2018 to 12.4% for the year ended March 31, 2019. 99 ----- Wages and salaries increased by €0.6 million, or 0.5%, from €119.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €119.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019, as a result of annual salary increases in France and Belgium and the expansion of our store network, partially offset by the sale of our Swedish operations in August 2018. As a percentage of sales of goods, wages and salaries increased from 8.2% for the year ended March 31, 2018 to 8.4% for the year ended March 31, 2019. Employee profit sharing decreased from €16.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €15.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2019, following the decrease in contractual profit sharing (“intéressement”), which is computed based on sales performance. Other personnel expenses increased from €39.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €41.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. The increase was partially explained by the lower impact of the CICE tax credit, which was recorded as a reduction of social security costs. The statutory rate of the CICE tax credit has been reduced since April 1, 2018 and converted into a reduction of social security charges since January 1, 2019. As a result, the CICE income recorded in reduction of social security costs declined from €6.7 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 to €4.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2019. This decline has been partially offset by lower social charges during the three months ended March 31, 2019. Excluding the impact of the CICE, social security costs decreased by €0.7 million, or 1.7%, from €40.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €39.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. _Other operating expenses_ Other operating expenses decreased by €1.6 million, from €7.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €5.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This decrease was partially due to a non-recurring €4.8 million provision regarding a reassessment on social charges recorded during the year ended March 31, 2018, following an audit conducted by the French administrative body responsible for collecting social security payments (“URSSAF”) and a €0.8 million provision relating to restructuring in Sweden recorded during the year ended March 31, 2018. The corresponding decrease was partially offset by exceptional charges relating to the sale of our Swedish operations recorded during the year ended March 31, 2019, which charges included a €0.9 million impairment charge and the derecognition of the minority interests in an amount of €2.1 million. _EBITDA_ EBITDA decreased by €8.0 million, or 4.0%, from €201.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €193.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in like-for-like sales and only partially offset by improved margin, increased other operating income following a tax refund relating to a fish tax and the sale of energy certificates, well-controlled operating expenses and the fact that EBITDA in the year ended March 31, 2018 had been affected by €4.8 million of litigation and restructuring provisions. Excluding the impact of those provisions, EBITDA amounted to €206.2 million in the year ended March 31, 2018. As a percentage of sales of goods, EBITDA decreased from 13.9% for the year ended March 31, 2018 to 13.6% for the year ended March 31, 2019. _Depreciation and amortization_ Depreciation and amortization decreased by €1.9 million, from €39.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €37.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to depreciation expenses relating to our stores in Sweden that were incurred during the year ended March 31, 2018. In September 2017, a €1.3 million depreciation expense relating to the assets of six Swedish stores to be closed was recorded. During the fourth quarter of the year ended March 31, 2018, considering the losses of our store network, the remaining fixed assets were also subject to a €2.7 million depreciation expense, bringing the fixed asset value of our Swedish store network to nil. As a percentage of sales of goods, depreciation and amortization decreased from 2.7% for the year ended March 31, 2018 to 2.6% for the year ended March 31, 2019. _Operating profit_ Operating profit decreased by €6.1 million, or 3.8%, from €161.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €155.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019, as a result of the combination of the factors described above. As a percentage of sales of goods, operating profit decreased from 11.2% for the year ended March 31, 2018 to 11.0% for the year ended March 31, 2019. 100 ----- _Finance costs_ Finance costs decreased by €34.9 million, from €92.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €57.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This decrease in finance costs was mainly due to the refinancing that occurred in December 2017. The early redemption of the 2013 Senior Secured Notes and the 2015 Senior Notes resulted in non-recurring finance costs of €25.1 million, reflecting the write-off of the non-amortized issuance fees (€8.5 million) and an early redemption premium (€16.6 million). Excluding these non-recurring costs, finance costs decreased by €9.8 million, from €67.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €57.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019, mainly due to the lower interest rates on the Existing Notes issued in December 2017 and May 2018, despite an increase in the aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding. _Income before Tax_ Income before tax increased by €28.8 million, from €69.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €98.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. As a percentage of sales of goods, income before tax increased from 4.8% for the year ended March 31, 2018 to 6.9% for the year ended March 31, 2019. _Income tax expense_ Income tax expense increased by €21.8 million, from €13.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €34.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. Income tax expense during the year ended March 31, 2018 included non- recurring deferred tax income of €30.5 million relating to the accounting impact of changes in tax rates on long-term deferred taxes. This income resulted from the reduction in the corporate income tax rate in France, adopted in the 2018 Budget Act and applicable starting in 2020, which reduced the tax rate used to calculate our deferred tax liability to 25.0% from 2022 onwards. As a result, long-term deferred taxes on pensions and regulated provisions were revalued based on the rate applicable as of 2020, which led to non-recurring deferred tax income of €28.8 million. In addition, income tax expense during the year ended March 31, 2019 included non-recurring deferred tax income of €10.3 million relating to the recognition of deferred tax assets on non-deductible interest expenses from previous periods. In accordance with thincapitalization rules applicable in France, interest expenses in an amount of €35.0 million were not deducted from the tax results in prior periods but were carried-forward. These unused tax credits were not recognized as deferred tax assets considering uncertainties as to whether such deductible interest expenses could be utilized against taxable results in the future. However, following changes in the capital structure resulting from the financing in December 2017, the Group believes it will now be able to deduct these interest expenses from its future taxable results. Therefore, we recognized the deferred tax assets corresponding to the carried-forward deductible interest expenses. Excluding the non-recurring effects on deferred taxes in the two periods, income tax expense increased by €1.5 million, from €43.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €45.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. As a percentage of income before tax, income tax expense decreased from 62.4% for the year ended March 31, 2018 to 45.7% for the year ended March 31, 2019. This decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to the incurrence of an exceptional contribution on corporate income tax, which was applicable only for the year ended March 31, 2018 and amounted to 15% of the corporate income tax. _Net income_ Net income increased by €7.2 million, from €56.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €63.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2019, as a result of the factors described above.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

357,Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.22,Liquidity and Capital Resources,17.22.2,,"We believe that the cash provided by our operating activities, available cash balances and commitments under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility available for future drawing will be sufficient to fund our projected working capital, debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months. Our financial condition and liquidity is and will continue to be influenced by a variety of factors, including: - our ability to generate cash flows from our operations; - the level of our outstanding indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, and the interest we are obligated to pay on such indebtedness, which affects our net financial expenses; 101 ----- - prevailing interest rates, which affect our debt service requirements; - our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to continue to borrow funds from financial institutions; and - our capital expenditure requirements, which consist mainly of costs to build and equip additional stores, maintenance expenses (including store remodeling) and IT projects. Our cash requirements consist mainly of the following: - funding capital expenditures; - funding operating activities; - servicing our indebtedness and the indebtedness of our subsidiaries; and - paying taxes. Our sources of liquidity consist mainly of the following: - cash generated from our operating activities; - structurally negative working capital inflow generated by our business model; - borrowings under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility (and, following completion of the Offerings, the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility); and - borrowings under debt securities, such as the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs and the Senior Notes. We generate working capital inflow because our customers pay cash for our products while we benefit from suppliers’ credit. Changes in working capital are mainly driven by trade working capital, particularly the level of inventories, the level of franchisees receivables and payment terms to merchandise suppliers, and overhead working capital.

Capital expenditures increased by €2.6 million, from €46.5 million in the year ended March 31, 2020 to €49.1 million in the year ended March 31, 2021. IT investments linked to the development of our digital sales and to refurbishments in our headquarters in Issy-les-Moulineaux were partly offset by a lower number of remodelings (81 in the year ended March 31, 2020 and 61 in the year ended March 31, 2021). Capital expenditures as a percentage of sales of goods decreased from 3.1% in the year ended March 31, 2020 to 2.8% in the year ended March 31, 2021 due to the lower increase in capital expenditures compared to the strong increase in sales. In the year ended March 31, 2020, capital expenditures increased by €11.2 million, from €35.2 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 to €46.5 million in the year ended March 31, 2020. Capital expenditures as a percentage of sales of goods increased from 2.5% in the year ended March 31, 2019 to 3.1% in the year ended March 31, 2020, mainly as a result of a higher number of own stores openings (12 in the year ended March 31, 2020 compared to nine in the year ended March 31, 2019), a flat number of remodelings (82 in the year ended March 31, 2019 and 81 in the year ended March 31, 2020) and higher remodeling costs due to investment in the “Vision” Concept. Capital expenditures, excluding store remodeling and store openings in France, represented 1.3% of sales of goods in the year ended March 31, 2020 and in the year ended March 31, 2019. In the year ended March 31, 2019, capital expenditures decreased by €2.2 million, from €37.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 to €35.2 million in the year ended March 31, 2019. Capital expenditures as a percentage of sales of goods decreased from 2.6% in the year ended March 31, 2018 to 2.5% in the year ended March 31, 2019, mainly as a result of a lower number of own stores openings (nine in the year ended March 31, 2019 compared to 18 in the year ended March 31, 2018) and a flat number of remodelings (82 in each of the years ended March 31, 2018 and March 31, 2019).

Net cash flows from operating activities increased by €128.4 million, from €128.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 to €256.8 million in the year ended March 31, 2020, mainly as a result of a €120.8 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities before interest expense and corporate income tax. This increase was mainly explained by the reclassification of payments related to leases following the adoption of IFRS 16, as of April 1, 2019. Payments related to leases were recorded under net cash flows from operating activities in the year ended March 31, 2019, whereas they are now classified as cash flows used in financing activities. Such payments amounted to €53.5 million in the year ended March 31, 2020. In addition, change in working capital requirements increased from a cash requirement of €19.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 to a cash generation of €34.0 million in the year ended March 31, 2020. Net cash flows from operating activities decreased by €30.9 million, from €159.3 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 to €128.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2019, mainly as a result of a €28.8 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid. This decrease was mainly explained by the change in working capital requirements that decreased from a cash generation of €3.4 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 to a cash requirement of €19.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2019. _Net cash used in investing activities_ Net cash used in investing activities increased by €2.5 million from €45.9 million in the year ended March 31, 2020 to €48.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2021. This increase is mainly explained by our IT investments linked to the development of our digital sales and by refurbishments in our headquarters in Issy-lesMoulineaux. Net cash used in investing activities increased by €11.3 million from €34.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2019 to €45.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. This increase was primarily due to the opening of a greater number of new stores, along with a larger investment in store remodelings linked with the development of the new “Vision” concept. Therefore, our investing activities during the periods under review were principally related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in connection with new and existing stores and IT equipment and software. Net cash used in investing activities decreased by €1.6 million from €36.2 million in the year ended March 31, 2018 to €34.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This decrease was primarily due to a lower number of store openings partially offset by other investments in stores on projects such as the roll-out of the Snack Bars or upgrades of the cold equipment. Our investing activities during the periods under review were principally related to the purchase of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets in connection with new and existing stores and IT equipment and software. _Net cash flows from / (used) in financing activities_ Net cash flows used in financing activities increased by €73.4 million, from €96.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 to €170.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2021. This increase is mainly due to the repayment of €30.0 million drawn under our Existing Revolving Credit Facility (compared with the drawing in the year ended March 31, 2020) and the payment of €24.5 million in dividends (compared to €13.1 million in the prior year). Net cash flows used in financing activities increased by €20.3 million, from €76.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €96.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. Interest paid, payments related to lease contracts and refinancing costs increased by €54.2 million from €59.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 to €113.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020. Net cash flows used in financing activities in the year ended March 31, 2019 also included €60.0 million additional proceeds from Existing Senior Secured Notes issuance used to fund a €77.0 million dividend to the shareholders of the Picard Group. Net cash flows used in 103 ----- financing activities in the year ended March 31, 2020 mainly comprise €30.0 million of proceeds from borrowings corresponding to the Existing Revolving Credit Facility being fully drawn in March 2020 due to uncertainties relating to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, partially offset by a €13.1 million payment to the shareholders of the Picard Group. In addition, in the year ended March 31, 2020, net cash used in financing activities corresponding to payments relating to lease contracts amounted to €52.3 million. Net cash flows used in financing activities decreased by €72.7 million, from €149.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €76.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily due to the refinancing that occurred in December 2017. On December 14, 2017, the Group issued €1,190 million aggregate principal amount of Existing Senior Secured Notes and €310 million aggregate principal amount of Existing Senior Notes. The gross proceeds from the sale of the Existing Notes, together with cash on hand, were used to (i) make a distribution to Picard PIKco S.A. in order to redeem Picard PIKco S.A.’s outstanding 11% PIK Notes due 2020, including accrued and uncapitalized interest and the applicable redemption premium, (ii) redeem the SN Issuer’s outstanding principal amount of 2015 Senior Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest and applicable redemption premium, (iii) redeem the Floating Rate SSN Issuer’s outstanding principal amount of 2013 Senior Secured Notes, including accrued and unpaid interest, (iv) fund distributions to the shareholders of the Picard Group, and (v) pay fees and expenses related to these transactions. Net cash flows used in financing activities in the year ended March 31, 2019 include a €60.0 million additional proceeds from Existing Senior Secured Notes issuance used to fund a €77.0 million dividend to the shareholders of the Picard Group. Interest paid, refinancing costs and payments related to lease liabilities decreased by €33.1 million from €92.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2018 to €59.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 mainly due to the refinancing that occurred in December 2017 that resulted in (i) the payment of an early redemption premium (€16.6 million) in December 2017 and (ii) lower interest rates on the Existing Notes issued in December 2017 and May 2018, despite an increase in the aggregate principal amount of debt outstanding.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

357,Offerings 2021.md,17,MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,17.35,,17.35.1,,"_The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our results of operations and financial condition during the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. The following should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under “Selected Historical Financial Information” and the consolidated financial statements of the SN Issuer prepared in accordance with IFRS-EU and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum. In addition, the following discussion and analysis presents EBITDA for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that represents operating profit before depreciation and amortization. This measure is derived from income statement items calculated in accordance with IFRS-EU and is used by management as an indicator of operating performance. EBITDA differs from the definitions of “Consolidated EBITDA” under our Indentures. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Information and Certain Definitions”. Since April 1, 2019, the Group has applied IFRS 16 in accordance with the modified retrospective approach. The application of this standard significantly increases the Group’s EBITDA. The Group has chosen to apply IFRS 16 using the simplified retrospective approach as of April 1, 2019 and the March 31, 2019 financial statements and the March 31, 2018 financial statements have consequently not been restated. Prior to the adoption of this standard, rent expenses were recorded in the line item “other purchases and external expenses”. Following the adoption of this new standard, the Group has recognized right-of-use assets for its eligible stores and vehicles, which are depreciated over the lease term, depreciation charges being recorded in the line item “depreciation and amortization” of the Group income statement, and a corresponding lease liability initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that have not been paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. As a result of the significant changes caused by the application of IFRS 16, the financial information presented in this Offering Memorandum for periods prior to the year ended March 31, 2020 may not be comparable to financial information for the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021. In December 2019, the IFRS interpretation committee (“IFRS IC”) published its decision clarifying the rules for determining the term of leases within the scope of IFRS 16. The application of this IFRS IC interpretation is a change in accounting method requiring a retrospective calculation of the impacts as of April 1, 2019 (applying the same incremental borrowing rates table as the one initially used by the Group at the first time application date, to the newly determined lease terms). The Group applied the IFRS IC interpretation relating to the assessment of leases with retroactive effect from April 1, 2019 and, consequently, in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, the comparative columns as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020 were recast (indicated as “restated”) to reflect a decision by the IFRS IC relating to the classification of leases under IFRS 16 (Leases). Therefore, the comparative financial information as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020 in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2021, is not directly comparable to the financial information in the Audited Financial Statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2020. The following discussion includes forward-looking statements based on assumptions about our future business. Our future results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements, including but not limited to those described under “Forward-Looking Statements”, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum.

Deep freezing is a food preservation process by which food products are frozen and kept at a temperature of —18°C or colder until sold to consumers. Frozen food products compete primarily against fresh food, processed food and other preserved food such as canned food and vacuum-packed food. We believe that frozen food products are attractive compared with other types of food products because: - they offer nutritional quality and taste at least similar to that of fresh food; - they retain nutrients and vitamins longer and are less perishable than fresh food due to the deep freezing process; - they can be unfrozen and prepared on an “as-needed” basis which helps avoid waste and overconsumption; - fruits and vegetables can be harvested at their maturity and then frozen, making it easier for consumers to enjoy them throughout the year; - prices of frozen food generally tend to be stable and less subject to seasonal variations when compared with the prices of fresh food products; and - they tend to be easier to prepare. Frozen food products are typically divided into eight main categories: vegetables, potato-based products, prepared meals, starters, fish, meat, ice-cream and desserts. We distribute frozen food products in each of these categories. During the year ended March 31, 2021, sales in France accounted for 97.6% of our total sales, with the remaining 1.2% in Belgium and Luxembourg, and 1.3% in Italy, Scandinavia, Singapore, Japan, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Frozen food products are required to comply with statutory cold chain requirements that address consumer food safety. Given the specialist nature of the business, the need for strong and specialized logistics and distribution platforms and tight control over the cold chain, barriers to entry are high. 107 ----- The following chart shows the growth of Picard’s market share since 2000. _(French frozen food market in  in billions)_ 8.9% 19.9% 20.6% 8.2 7.3 1.7 5.6 0.5 1.5 5.8 5.1 6.5 2000 2019 2020 ### % Picard market share Source: Management sources and Nielsen data Market excl.

Furthermore, in 2020, the online grocery shopping accounted for about 6.1% of the frozen food market. During the same period, we maintained our leadership position and our sales of frozen food in mainland France increased from approximately €532 million in 2000 to €1,429 million (including VAT) in 2019.

The frozen food market share of multiple grocers in France has declined from 62.1% in 2000 to 44.5% in 2020. In 2020, Nielsen Retailers Panel estimated that multiple grocers generated frozen food sales of €3.6 billion. We believe that we and other specialist stores are able to offer a wider variety of frozen food products. For example, most of our stores in France offer approximately 1,000 different frozen food SKUs. Hypermarket chains are characterized by a smaller but large choice of frozen products (500-750 SKUs) and competitiveness on price, and are typically located outside of city centers. Supermarkets and convenience stores, such as Casino, Daily Monop’, Carrefour Market and Carrefour City, are located closer to customers’ homes in city centers, but carry a smaller range of frozen products (100-300 SKUs) at a higher price point as well as a range of fresh food, and thus compete with us in terms of both location and product offerings. We offer approximately two times as many SKUs as multiple grocers. Our recent strategy has been to enhance our competitiveness as many retailers are now entering the upmarket range of frozen food products, leading to an increase in product mix and higher average prices, while some of our suppliers have started to distribute their products to multiple retailers under their own brands.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.3,Main Competitors and Market Shares,18.3.2,Specialist stores and home delivery retailers,"Specialist stores and home delivery retailers mainly consist of us, Place du Marché (formerly Toupargel), Thiriet and small local retailers specializing solely in the distribution of frozen food products (Maximo, Argel, Bofrost, Ecomiam and Eismann). These competitors generally offer basic products at prices lower than branded products offered by multiple grocers, as well as more expensive product offerings in the case of Place du Marché and Thiriet. They usually sell frozen food products of their own brands, rather than national brands, though some, like Place du Marché, also sell national brands and fresh products, along with other items such as home care products. The frozen food market share of specialist stores and home delivery retailers in France (including ourselves) has increased from 29.8% in 2000 to 33.4% in 2020. We believe this increase was largely due to the increase in our market share, which more than offset the decline in market share of the other specialist stores and home delivery retailers during the same period. 109 ----- We are the only specialist frozen food retailer with a national presence and the largest specialist frozen food retailer in France, with a market share approximately three times larger than those of our closest competitors, Place du Marché and Thiriet, taken together. We believe that specialist stores are more attractive to consumers than multiple grocers and hard discounters for a number of reasons, including: - they offer a wider range of frozen food products; - they have fewer out-of-stock products as a result of their cold chain expertise; - they offer a better overall shopping experience, including well-organized stores with clear product presentations and a better control of the cold chain; and - their proximity to consumers increases the likelihood that products will be delivered quickly, which also helps maintain the integrity of the cold chain for the convenience and safety of the consumers. _Hard discounters_ Hard discounters are retailers that sell consumer goods at aggressive prices, such as Lidl and Aldi. Hard discounters generally offer frozen food products at prices significantly lower than specialists and multiple grocers. They compete, however, on a more limited product range, usually focusing on more affordable and lower-quality products. They frequently target low-income households. In particular, since 2017, the market share of hard discounters has increased as a result of significant efforts by its major actor in France, Lidl, which has improved its strategic positioning and strongly increased its media investments. Nielsen Retailers Panel estimates that hard discounters accounted for approximately €0.9 billion of French frozen food market sales in 2020. We offer approximately four times as many SKUs as hard discounters. _Convenience stores_ Convenience stores in France consist of small stores for everyday shopping located in dense urban areas, which offer products to meet the needs of local customers. Factors such as smaller household sizes, longer working hours and the trend toward reducing food waste are favorable for convenience stores as customers move towards shopping “for the night” or for the next few days. Convenience store chains in France include Franprix, Leader Price Express, Carrefour Contact, City & Market and Monop’Daily. The convenience stores segment has experienced strong growth over the past 10 years notably as a result of an increase in the number of stores that have been rebranded under the names of major supermarket chains (for example, Dia stores, previously considered a hard discounter, have been rebranded as Carrefour Contact or Carrefour City stores).

The rising rates of cardiovascular disease and obesity have influenced and, we believe, will continue to influence food choices. At the same time, consumers are paying increased attention to the quality of ingredients used, as well as their traceability, sustainability and health effects.

In calendar year 2020, we had an approximate 20.6% market share (including ice cream products) of the approximately €8.2 billion French frozen food market according to internal data and industry publications (prepared by Nielsen Retailers Panel and Syndigel). We offer our customers a total of approximately 1,250 different frozen food SKUs (or an average of approximately 1,000 SKUs per store), including unprocessed meat, fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables and bakery products, as well as a full range of ready-made starters, main courses, desserts and ice cream at various price points. We introduced the concept of premium quality, appetizing frozen food to French consumers when we opened our first store in Paris in 1974. Since then, we have continued to develop the market for frozen food products in France by transforming the way the French public perceives and consumes frozen food. We sell products under our own Picard brand (approximately 95% of our sales of frozen products during the year ended March 31, 2021), as well as under a few national and international brands, such as, for example, Häagen-Dazs, Charal and Ben & Jerry’s. In France, our Picard products are sold almost exclusively through our store network (including through our new Click & Collect program) as well as through Home Delivery, which extends throughout France due to our partnerships with courier companies, including “Chronofresh”, a Chronopost subsidiary. We have successfully expanded our network over the years, and we opened an average of 40 new stores per year from the year ended March 31, 2002 to the year ended March 31, 2012 and an average of 24 new stores per year from April 2012 to March 31, 2021 (either directly-operated stores or through franchises in France and abroad). As of March 31, 2021, we had 1,051 stores in France (including two franchised stores in Corsica, two franchised stores in the French West Indies, ten franchised stores in La Réunion, two franchised stores in New Caledonia and 22 franchised stores in mainland France), 14 stores in Belgium, 15 franchised stores in Japan, one store in Luxembourg and ten franchised stores in Scandinavia. We also sell our products abroad through various additional channels. For instance, we sell products in the United Kingdom through the grocery home delivery service Ocado and the grocery store Marks & Spencer and in Singapore through a partnership with RedMart. Additionally, through a partnership with Albert Heijn, a number of Picard products are offered in certain Albert Heijn supermarkets and hypermarkets in the Netherlands. Since August 2018, a joint venture partner has operated the network of stores in Sweden, which we previously owned, and also sells our products in ICA stores. We outsource the production of all of our products to approximately 260 different suppliers in calendar year 2020, allowing us to concentrate on quality control and new product research, development and innovation. We continuously review our product offering and introduce on average approximately 250 new SKUs a year. During the year ended March 31, 2021, we continued our innovation efforts and we introduced 287 new SKUs (representing approximately 23% of our 1,250 frozen food SKUs), including exclusive national brands and new SKUs for thematic campaigns. As a result of our innovation efforts, many of our products are unique to us, which we believe attracts customers to our stores. We have successfully increased our Total retail France sales over the last 10 years from €1,181.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2011 to €1,646.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, representing a compound annual growth rate of 3.4% despite certain economic and industry challenges during that period. For the year ended March 31, 2021, sales in France, which include sales from our directly-operated stores as well as Home Delivery and sales to our franchisees located in mainland France, Corsica, the French West Indies, La Réunion and New Caledonia accounted for 97.6% of our total sales, with sales in Belgium, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Singapore and the United Kingdom generating the remaining balance. Our Total retail France sales were €1,646.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2021, increasing by 15.5% compared to the same period in the prior year, which was due, in part, to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In the 1940s, our predecessor began our first wholesale 112 ----- activity in frozen foods. In 1971, we launched our first frozen food catalogue and home delivery sales. In 1973, Armand Decelle acquired the business and became the chairman and CEO. Under his direction, we first focused on the home delivery of unprocessed quality food products, such as vegetables and seafood. In 1974, we opened our first retail store in Paris and we opened stores outside of Paris in Antibes (in the South of France) and Lyon (France’s second largest metropolitan area) in 1987. That same year, we opened our 100[th] store and by 1997 we operated 300 stores. During this period, our product line also evolved to include more sophisticated products, such as prepared meals. In the 47 years since opening our first retail store we have become a household name in France known for providing premium quality, natural and competitively priced products. In 1984, we changed our name to Picard Surgelés and we co-founded Primex, a French importer, with a family- owned partner; we currently hold approximately 37.21% of its share capital. Primex is our main supplier of fish, as well as a supplier of meat products. In 1991, Carrefour, the listed French food retailer, acquired a 10% stake in Picard Surgelés and in 1994 raised that stake to approximately 74%. From 1994 until 2001, Picard Surgelés operated as a subsidiary of Carrefour. During the 1990s, our presence in France increased more than twofold, growing from 184 stores in 1991 to 441 stores in 2000. In 2001, we were sold to an LBO consortium headed by Candover, which acquired approximately 79% of our share capital. We were subsequently acquired in a secondary LBO in 2004 by funds advised by BC Partners. From 2005 to 2009, we grew from over 600 stores to over 800 stores in France and Italy, opening an average of 46 new stores per year. On September 14, 2010, an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of the SN Issuer entered into a securities purchase agreement to acquire, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of Picard. From the completion of the Acquisition in October 2010 to August 2015, Lion Capital was the Issuers’ principal shareholder through its investment management funds and indirectly owned, together with minority co-investors, approximately 98.6% of the Issuers’ issued and outstanding ordinary shares. On August 19, 2015, Aryzta, a worldwide group active in the food industry and leader in the manufacturing and distribution of bakeryrelated products to industrial companies acquired a 49.5% interest in the Picard Group’s indirect parent company Lux HoldCo, from Lion Capital. In January 2020, Aryzta sold a 42% stake in Picard Group to the French company Invest Group Zouari (“IGZ”), and, in January 2021, Aryzta sold its remaining stake in Picard, proportionately, to Lion Capital and IGZ. Lion Capital remains the majority shareholder of the Group. Since completion of the Acquisition, we continued to expand, opening 183 net directly-operated stores in mainland France and, in line with our national and international expansion strategy, we also opened stores in Belgium and Luxembourg, along with franchised stores in mainland France, Corsica, the French West Indies, Japan, La Réunion, New Caledonia, Sweden and Switzerland. As of March 31, 2021, we had 1,051 stores in France, including 1,013 directly-operated stores in mainland France, 22 franchised stores in mainland France, two franchised stores in Corsica, two franchised stores in the French West Indies, ten franchised stores in La Réunion and two franchised stores in New Caledonia, 14 in Belgium and one in Luxembourg. We also sell our products in 15 franchised stores in Japan and ten franchised stores in Scandinavia, as well as through 45 stores in Italy through a partnership with an Italian food company. In August 2018, we sold our Swedish operations to our joint-venture partner and entered into a five year franchisee agreement, whereby the franchisee will continue to sell our products in Sweden with a leading Swedish supermarket, ICA. During the periods under review, a franchisee also operated six stores in Switzerland, but these were closed in early January 2020. We expect to expand our franchised store model to other smaller cities throughout mainland France, with a view to increasing our presence in those cities. In addition, we expect to open additional franchised stores in Japan and also intend to further expand in Belgium while developing our existing commercial partnerships, such as with Ocado and Marks & Spencer in the United Kingdom and in Singapore through a commercial agreement with RedMart, and considering future opportunities to expand into new countries and regions. In Japan, we adopted the franchised stores model in 2016 following an initial trial period during which we tested Japanese customers’ appetite for our products. This initial trial was conducted in the form of a commercial partnership with Aeon, a local actor familiar with the local regulatory environment, food retail market and culture. Additionally, we sell a limited range of products in the United Kingdom through a commercial agreement with Ocado, a grocery home delivery service, and Marks & Spencer.

Since 2011, Picard has consistently ranked among the retail banners most favored by French consumers. In 2018, the consulting firm EY-Parthenon published the results of a 8,500 consumer panel study in which it ranked Picard as its number one banner overall and, in 2019, OC&C ranked Picard the second most favorite retail banner of French consumers (ahead of other well-known and highly recognized retailers such as Sephora, Leroy Merlin, IKEA and Amazon). In 2021, a study conducted by Partoo on the online reputation of retailers based on online reviews and ratings of our stores revealed that Picard was the retailer with the highest rating (correlated to the number of reviews) with a rating of 4.3 out of 5. We believe that our leading brand position results from a combination of factors, including our reputation for quality and convenience, the range and diversity of our products and our national footprint of stores situated in high traffic areas. In addition, we constantly seek to innovate and maintain the relevance of our product range. For example, in recent years, we have increasingly focused on healthy and natural products, including our low-fat products, comprising the “+ d’équilibre” line of low-fat meals. In 2020, we accelerated the development of our healthy offerings with the launch of a new range of products from farms that are in the process of being designated as “organic” and the development of vegetarian and vegan products (new vegan product line). Between calendar years 2005 and 2020, we increased the number of organic product SKUs from 14 to 114 units, representing respectively 1.2% and 7.9% of our SKUs. Over the same period, as a percentage of sales of goods, sales of organic products also increased from 1.2% in calendar year 2005 to 7.4% in calendar year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, we introduced 28 new organic product SKUs (excluding wines), in line with our plan to continuously improve our product offerings. We continuously strive to make our prepared meals as balanced and healthy as possible, including reducing the levels of salt, saturated fat and hidden sugars. We endeavor to ensure that none of our products contains genetically modified organisms (“GMOs”), artificial colorings, hydrogenated fats or other harmful additives. We emphasize local products, with at least 70% of our products made in France and 90% of our unprocessed meat and 100% of beef in all our products coming from animals reared in France. We also prioritize sustainably sourced seafood, with 53 MSC labeled products and 21 ASC labeled products, as of March 31, 2021. Moreover, we have devised various niche ranges to meet the specific needs of some of our customers such as gluten-free products or products designed for lacto-ovo-vegetarians, including our range of “Tout bon tout veggie” products. We intend to offer a broad product range to reach as broad a customer base as possible. For example, we have designed a range of products intended to meet the needs of our customers who are looking for a quick, tasty and nutritious prepared meal that is specifically designed for one person and is affordable; the “Formule Express” is priced at between €2.00 and €3.00 per unit, which tends to be very popular amongst our customers. We have also designed the range “Bons petits plats”, a selection of high-quality individual meals with a higher price point. Our strong brand recognition and the fact that consumers associate our food with nutrition, healthy eating, authenticity and taste are key drivers of consumer interest in our products, visits to our stores and our ability to generate high sales volumes and attractive margins. The appeal and high-quality of our product offering is highlighted by one of our aspiring taglines “For better and for best” (“Pour le bon et le meilleur”).

We introduce on average approximately 250 new SKUs per year and we continuously review, update and replace our products to ensure that we always offer our customers innovative and interesting choices. Over the past few years, we have increased our efforts to offer innovative products to our customers, with regular new product launches. In total, we introduced approximately 287 new SKUs during the year ended March 31, 2021. We believe that being a leader in innovation allows us to foster our existing customers’ loyalty by keeping customers interested in our product offerings over time. Additionally, while frozen food remains our established core business, which we have cultivated over more than 40 years, we also offer our customers a variety of non-frozen quality food and gourmet products. For example, we have a fast growing range of grocery products and a selection of wines and champagne. We have also developed new concepts aimed at increasing brand awareness and attracting new customers. Our experience leads us to believe that our commitment to innovation, our expertise and our ability to create new products each year is unmatched.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We more than doubled our market share (including ice cream) from approximately 9% in 2000 to approximately 20.6% in 2020, and believe that we have been instrumental in influencing the consumption habits of French consumers toward frozen food, helping to drive the growth of the market with our innovation and commitment to quality. Our market position is supported by our extensive store network, which consists of 1,013 directlyoperated stores in France as of March 31, 2021 (along with 22 franchised stores in mainland France, two franchised stores in Corsica, ten franchised stores in La Réunion, two franchised stores in the French West Indies and two franchised stores in New Caledonia). Due to our extensive experience, and the great care we take, in opening stores, we have been successful at identifying attractive locations. We believe that our store portfolio has a remarkably homogenous performance and we have rarely closed stores (only 17 in the past two decades in France). Even during a global pandemic, we were able to open 17 new stores in mainland France in the year ended March 31, 2021 (14 directly-owned stores and three franchised stores). We believe that our extensive, high-quality network of retail stores in France positions us favorably in comparison to our competitors that do not have such an extensive network and also represents a significant barrier to entry to other competitors.

While we have long-standing relationships with many of our suppliers, we believe we are not dependent on any one supplier and have the flexibility to change or add new suppliers if needed. In the 2020 calendar year, our largest supplier represented approximately 5.8% of our purchases by value, our five largest suppliers represented 22.4% of our purchases by value, our 10 largest suppliers represented 33.7% of our purchases by value and our 20 largest suppliers represented 50.1% of our purchases by value. We have stable and long-standing relationships with the majority of our main suppliers, and the terms of our supply agreements allow for significant flexibility, which is essential to our ability to make production changes quickly and efficiently. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe our relationships with our suppliers 115 ----- have enabled us to increase volumes in response to increased demand. In addition, all of our logistics, including all eight of our warehouses, are outsourced. In 2020, we were able to adapt and increase the number of warehouses that service our Home Delivery channel from two to three in order to meet the increased demand for Home Delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 31, 2021, approximately 89% of our stores in mainland France were leased pursuant to “commercial leases”, which grant significant rights under French law to lessees compared to leases in many other jurisdictions. We believe that our business model affords us significant flexibility and ability to expand, particularly given the modest capital expenditures required to expand our store network, allowing management to focus on the higher value-added aspects of our business, such as reviewing our product range and keeping operating costs under control.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Furthermore, our revenue has grown every year since 1986, demonstrating the long-term stability of our business, with the exception of fiscal years 2014 and 2019 (with the revenue decline in fiscal year 2014 mainly due to an industry-wide incident in France concerning the discovery of horsemeat in prepared meals, including two of our prepared beef products, and the revenue decline in fiscal year 2019 mainly due to the political context in France as our results were negatively impacted by the “Yellow Vest” protests in France which peaked during our traditionally busiest period and, at times, restricted physical access to our stores). Our business also benefits from relatively low capital expenditure requirements, which is supported by the fact that our standardized store format allows for cost-efficient store openings and maintenance. Our total capital expenditures represented 2.5%, 3.1% and 2.8% of our sales of goods for the years ended March 31, 2019, March 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, respectively. In the year ended March 31, 2021, 11.7% of our capital expenditures were related to new store openings. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of _Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Capital Expenditures”. In_ addition, our working capital is structurally negative, meaning that our working capital requirements tend to generate a cash inflow as we grow the business. Our strong margins, favorable working capital structure and low capital expenditure requirements have allowed us to generate significant cash flow even during the economic downturn and resulted in an EBITDA to cash-flow conversion rate of 81.0%, 70.3%, 95.0% and 93.3% for the years ended March 31, 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively, with an average of 84.9% over the last four fiscal years. This has allowed us to reduce our financial leverage, in terms of net debt to EBITDA (on a pre-IFRS 16 basis), from 7.0x as of March 31, 2018 to 4.3x as of March 31, 2021. 116 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.7,Our Competitive Strengths,18.7.6,Attractive and resilient market,"Between calendar years 2000 and 2019, we estimate that the French frozen food market for at-home consumption grew by approximately 30%, from approximately €5.6 billion in 2000 to approximately €7.3 billion (including VAT) in 2019 (including convenience and drive/e-commerce). During the same period, our sales in France grew from approximately €532 million in 2000 to €1,429 million for the calendar year ended December 31, 2019 (including VAT). For the calendar year 2020, we estimate that the French frozen food market for at-home consumption grew by approximately 12.3%, from approximately €7.3 billion in 2019 to approximately €8.2 billion (including VAT) in 2020 (including convenience and drive/e-commerce), which is largely attributable to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. During the same period, our sales in France grew from €1,429 million in 2019 to €1,682 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 (including VAT), mainly due to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The French food market has historically remained resilient in challenging low-growth economic conditions and we believe market growth has been driven by favorable demographic and sociological trends, such as increases in the number of single-parent families, single-person households and women in full-time employment, decreases in the amount of time allocated each day to the preparation of meals and an increasing focus on healthy food. Frozen food products offer nutritional quality and taste similar to that of fresh food and retain nutrients and vitamins longer through deep freezing. In addition, our target market extends beyond the frozen food segment into the much larger packaged and chilled food sectors, as we also compete against alternatives, such as fresh products from farmers’ markets, traditional bakeries and butcher shops and upscale delicatessens. We believe that French consumers increasingly accept frozen food made from quality ingredients as a healthy, tasty and convenient alternative to fresh food products. In addition, we believe that customers are increasingly conscious of the fact that frozen food limits food waste as customers can use portions as needed. We believe that our ability to create and embrace new trends in the food market will allow us to continue to consolidate our leadership position, which we believe will be essential as the French frozen food market matures. For example, our wines and champagnes have been a source of growth in our dry products category, and complement our frozen food offering. As of March 31, 2021, our wine and champagne selection was available in 907 stores. Other trends (such as the increasing market share of organic products) and new consumption patterns also constitute opportunities for us to increase our sales and generate growth. Based on Nielsen data (including VAT) and their commercial calendar, we believe we outperformed the French frozen food market by approximately 600 basis points and the overall food market by approximately 1,100 basis points in the year ended March 31, 2021 (with our revenue growing by approximately 15.2%, as compared to market growth in the broader French frozen food market of approximately 8.8% and the overall food market of approximately 4.4%).",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

357,Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Our Strategy,18.8.1,Optimize like-for-like sales performance,"Historically, we have had robust like-for-like sales growth and plan to increase our like-for-like sales growth with a data-driven, customer-oriented commercial strategy, optimized product offerings and improved store concepts. We regularly introduce new, complementary products to seek to increase our customers’ average basket size and number of tickets. We also intend to improve sales to our existing customer base by amending and updating our CRM program “Picard & Moi”, launched in 2017. Our aim is to make shopping with Picard a part of our customers’ daily lives. We believe that our customers have been particularly attracted to the convenience and premium quality of our offering during the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the closure of restaurants and workplace cafeterias during lockdowns and the related increase in at-home consumption (even 117 ----- outside of lockdown periods). We believe many of our existing customers have discovered additional products among our offering (with higher average baskets driven by both average price unit and number of SKUs in the basket, including between lockdowns) and many new customers have been introduced to Picard. For example, approximately 300,000 active new members (net of inactive customers) joined our customer loyalty program, “Picard & moi”, in 2020. Going forward, we aim to maintain a higher average basket (compared to pre-pandemic periods), retain new customers even after the pandemic has ended and attract new customers, particularly younger customers. We initiated the reinforcement of our CRM program during the year 2020 and created a new department in charge of Brand, Digital & Customer Experience under the supervision of Emmanuelle Bach Donnard, a key executive who joined our management team in 2020. In addition, in January 2021, we hired a new CRM manager to assist us with further developing our CRM program, which we have been developing since 2015. We plan to maintain our commitment to offering customers a wide range of premium quality products at a variety of price points while continuing to develop innovative products that are unique to Picard. Our organic offerings are one of the categories that we believe have attracted new customers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we intend to continue providing new healthy and organic products. Going forward, we also intend to adapt our product offerings based on store type and geography to maximize sales. We also plan to continue investing in our internal research capabilities and our staff and developing long-term partnerships with leading suppliers. Additionally, we seek to provide our customers with a superior retail shopping experience by remodeling our stores when necessary. In 2020, Picard was ranked first for client experience in its stores by dunnhumby, a customer data science specialist, in its study Retailer Preference Index. We believe that the remodeling of our stores increases traffic by creating a more modern and attractive environment and generates sales growth. In the years ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, we remodeled 81 and 61 stores, respectively. Going forward, we plan to continue to improve our store concept “Vision” and expect to accelerate the remodeling of our stores to enhance the customers’ experience in-store, with an anticipated average remodeling rate of approximately 140 stores per year (provided that the results from remodeled stores indicate that such remodeling is effective). We seek to continue improving our sales performance by focusing on our customer base, the products we offer and the environment we create.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.8,Our Strategy,18.8.2,Expand our store footprint in France and internationally,"We believe that, over time, there is the potential to continue our successful expansion strategy in France with the opening of additional directly-operated stores in large and medium cities and complementary franchised stores in smaller cities. We estimate that there is the potential to open approximately 200 more stores in France. In particular, we believe that our plan to further expand our franchised store model, after five years of successful implementation in mainland France, will increase our local presence in smaller cities and brand awareness, while helping us negotiate better terms with our suppliers through increased volumes, with no or limited additional capital expenditures. As of March 31, 2021, we sell our products through 22 franchised stores in smaller cities in mainland France. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen an increase in the amount of inbound interest from potential franchisees in opening franchised stores. In addition, we believe we can grow our current network of 1,013 directly-operated retail stores in mainland France as of March 31, 2021, without meaningful adverse effects on our average sales per store. Most of our stores are located in or near city centers and metropolitan areas. We monitor the cannibalization of sales in surrounding stores following the opening of a new store and have not noticed any material increase in cannibalization in the past few years. We believe that a higher density of stores will contribute to top-of-mind awareness for customers and support store visit frequency. Our management team identifies potential directly-operated and franchised store sites based on demographics, the availability of suitable retail space, local economic conditions and other factors that we believe are relevant to the successful expansion of our store network and that should enable us to capitalize on the anticipated increased traffic and sales volume of our new stores. We believe that our new stores will benefit from strong brand awareness and existing marketing campaigns, and consequently require only limited incremental marketing support. We also plan to further expand our existing network of stores and explore strategic alternatives to further develop our presence outside of mainland France and internationally, including through franchising arrangements and new partnerships. Our international presence primarily consists of directly-operated stores in Belgium and Luxembourg, and franchised stores in Scandinavia and Japan. In the year ended March 31, 2021, we opened three franchised stores in mainland France, two franchised stores in Ile de la Réunion and two franchised stores in New Caledonia. Thus far, the results of these franchised stores have been promising. We intend to continue our expansion in Belgium (having opened one additional store in Namur in May 2021) and in Japan, as well as 118 ----- exploring opportunities to expand into new countries and regions. In particular, we are focusing on forming partnerships that allow us to access smaller markets that may not support a large Picard presence. These partnerships allow us to understand and evaluate a local market for any franchising potential, while limiting our risk. Following the divestment of our Italian subsidiary in May 2015, we entered into a commercial agreement with a local partner, allowing us to maintain our presence in Italy; our partner sells Picard products in its stores. Since January 2018, a number of Picard products are offered in Albert Heijn supermarkets and hypermarkets in the Netherlands, as well as through their website. In August 2018, we sold our Swedish operations to our jointventure partner and entered into a five-year franchisee agreement, whereby the franchisee continues to sell our products in Sweden, including through corners with a leading Swedish supermarket, ICA. In January 2020, we extended our activities in Singapore through a partnership with Redmart. In addition, we have entered into commercial partnerships in the United Kingdom with the grocery home delivery service Ocado beginning in 2016 and the food store Marks & Spencer beginning in July 2020. We continue to look for strategic alternatives to develop our international markets. Our international operations (consisting of sales in Belgium, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Singapore and the United Kingdom) accounted for 2.4% of our sales for the year ended March 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Over the same period, the number of online orders increased by approximately 14%. During the year ended March 31, 2021, our Home Delivery sales amounted to €58.9 million (or 3.3% of our total sales), an increase of €27.4 million, or 86.7%, from €31.5 million in the previous year due, in part, to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the same period, the number of online orders increased by approximately 104.1% also due, in part, to the positive impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that current trends and the growth observed in our Home Delivery channel show a successful shift towards the digital channel (in addition to the positive impact on this channel due to the COVID-19 pandemic), a distribution channel that is complementary to our network of ‘brick-and-mortar’ stores and adapts to the preferences of our younger customers. In addition, we believe that customers using multiple channels have a stronger loyalty to the brand and that their total annual expenditure at Picard is higher than other customers. Further increasing our online sales will enable us to capture an additional segment of the market, including customers in areas with little store presence, and supplement visits to our stores by offering consumers an additional and convenient channel. Following the launch of our new website in June 2020, we intend to make continuing improvements to our website in order to maintain and increase our online sales. We have also developed a “Picard app” for smartphones, which offers numerous services to our customers, including the ability to order through Home Delivery since January 2016, and we are planning to launch an updated app, which is more user-friendly and better designed for mobile phones, in the second half of calendar year 2021 to replace the existing app. In addition to developing and improving high-quality digital tools, we have also improved our overall Home Delivery offering with the expansion of delivery times to better match customers’ needs, the creation of additional services and a focus on faster response times and quicker deliveries. We were able to capture the increased demand for home deliveries resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic with a quick response, including having a third warehouse equipped for Home Delivery and partnering with courier companies, including “Chronofresh”, a Chronopost subsidiary, in late November 2020. We plan to further explore potential collaborations with third parties that may have the infrastructure to assist with ‘last mile’ home deliveries and allow us to expand our reach of Home Delivery across France. We also launched our new Click & Collect program in late November 2020, which contributed an additional €0.8 million of sales over the test period in a limited number of stores at Christmas and we plan to extend that service to most of our stores in 2021. In addition, we have recently launched frozen food vending machines, offering a selected range of products at convenient locations, such as corporate workplaces and schools; this concept was launched at 25 sites during its first year in 2020, despite the constraints of the COVID-19 pandemic.

We have a Quality and Sustainable Development director who reports directly to the company CEO, and supervises a dedicated ESG team comprising four full-time staff as well as regular committees across various departments, including our human resources, technical support teams, and supply chain departments, to follow and ensure implementation of our various action plans. Our annual key performance indicators for corporate social responsibility are monitored and collected across the relevant operational divisions, with internal compliance controls to ensure the consistency with our historical figures. We intend to strengthen our brand by continuing and increasing our commitment to organic foods and sustainable sourcing, in order to meet both consumers’ expectations and emerging environmental concerns, such as overfishing and large-scale industrial agriculture. Since we launched our first organic products in 1998, we have expanded the number of organic products we offer to 120 SKUs in the year ended March 31, 2021. In addition to increasing the number and broadening the selection of organic products, we have improved the visibility of such products in-store with dedicated freezer compartments and an easily identifiable trademark for our organic products (“Le Bio par Picard”). Our other commitments for more responsible consumption include focusing on animal welfare (for example, by aiming to have all our egg-based products made from cage-free eggs by 2025), sustainable farming and fishing (for example, by prioritizing products made in France when possible as well as seafood and fish products with a third-party sustainability certification), locally sourced products (for example, by ensuring 70% of our products are made in France and 90% of our unprocessed meat (and 100% of beef in our products) comes from animals reared in France), and healthy eating (for example, by reducing the levels of salt, saturated fat and hidden sugars). We are also committed to improving our ESG performance in other ways that are meaningful to our business and stakeholders. For example, at the beginning of 2020, Picard committed to reducing our plastic packaging by reducing both the thickness of packaging and by replacing plastic with other materials. The work of our product development teams has enabled us to reduce the plastic used in our packaging by 325 tonnes in calendar year 2020, a 4% reduction as compared to calendar years 2018 and 2019 despite increases in volumes sold. We are aiming to use 100% recyclable plastic by 2025 (compared with 71% today). We are continuing to prioritize the energy efficiency of our business operations with a focus on using renewable energy with 100% of the energy consumed in our stores coming from renewable sources. In accordance with our newly-established Sustainability Performance Targets, we aim to reduce the energy consumption by our stores by 6% by 2023 (compared to our 2020 baseline) and to reduce carbon emissions from our shipping networks and logistics chains by 10% by 2023 (compared to our 2019 baseline). Finally, we are committed to improving the well-being of our employees and supporting diversity and inclusion among our workforce. Around 70% of our workforce is made up of women and we have scored 94 out of 100 in the gender equality index established by the French government. We also employ dedicated Disability Project Managers to assist our disabled employees. We plan to continue to strive to provide more advanced equipment to our employees to minimize strenuous tasks and improve safety, as well as developing remote work policies to accommodate special employee situations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2018, we entered into an agreement on equality and quality of life at work, which was signed by all trade unions of which our employees are members; this agreement has a four-year term, and reinforces our corporate policies, including with respect to equality during the recruitment process and better integration of employees with disabilities. In January 2021, the association “Génération Responsable,” which promotes sustainable development in the retail sector, awarded Picard with the sustainability development label of “responsible brand” (“Enseigne _Responsable”), created to promote companies who have structured and integrated ESG features as part of their_ global strategy. 120 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Our R&D, marketing and purchasing departments are centralized and organized according to our nine families of products in order to 121 ----- coordinate the innovation and development process. We believe that product innovation is one of the main ways we differentiate ourselves from competitors, answer market needs and improve the quality of our food, thus allowing us to generate comfortable margins. We constantly review and update our range of products to keep up with our customers’ changing needs and preferences and we introduce approximately 250 new SKUs per year (representing nearly 20% of our offering of approximately 1,250 SKUs). During the year ended March 31, 2021, we pursued our innovation efforts with the introduction of 287 new SKUs. Our new products are rolled out throughout the year and linked to promotions and seasonal demand (for example, we launch special products for Christmas and New Year celebrations, the Chinese New Year and Valentine’s Day). Our innovation policy focuses on developing original products, some of which we anticipate will set trends and create new segments in the frozen food market. Some of our most successful products, such as moëlleux au _chocolat, have brought popular traditional foods to the frozen food category for the first time. We believe our_ ability to initiate market trends is partly due to our regular introduction of new products using flavors or techniques that are relatively new in France (examples of which are set out in the table below). We also rely on direct customer feedback, notably through our customer service hotline, in addition to proposals from our suppliers and our own research team. Our R&D team works closely with our purchasing and marketing teams in order to quickly improve our products in response to customer feedback.

We select our suppliers based on strict specifications related to product quality and generally reappoint our suppliers of unprocessed food annually and our suppliers of prepared foods every two to three years. We believe the caliber of our suppliers has contributed to Picard’s strong track record of quality control. We do not believe that we are dependent on any one supplier or that the loss of any one supplier would have a material adverse effect on our business. In calendar year 2020, our five largest suppliers represented 22.4% of our purchases by value, our 10 largest suppliers represented 33.7% of our purchases by value and our 20 largest suppliers represented 50.1% of our purchases by value. Our largest supplier represented approximately 5.5% of our purchases by value. We develop most of our products internally but outsource the manufacturing to approximately 260 different suppliers. We invite our suppliers to diversify their own client bases as well.

In the event a supplier does not adhere to our specifications, we have the right to terminate such supplier immediately, and have done so in the past. In calendar year 2020, at least 70% of our products were sourced from suppliers based in France including, since March 2013, 100% of our beef products, while the remainder is obtained from suppliers located abroad, including in Belgium, Canada, Chile, Italy, New Zealand, Norway, Thailand and the United Kingdom. In designing our product specifications, we also focus on the length of the supply chain, choosing shorter supply chains where possible, to ensure freshness and effective traceability.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We work very closely with our suppliers, whether directly or through our importers, to ensure that our specifications as to quality and quantity are complied with. We treat our suppliers as partners, emphasizing to them that they are harvesting or fishing for us and for our brands. Our contracts with our suppliers typically fix prices for one year, which helps minimize price fluctuation. For high-volume purchases, we generally work with multiple suppliers. In 2020, we imported products from around the globe, including, for example, Canada, Chile, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Thailand. Notably, most of our contracts with suppliers are priced in euro, so we do not have any significant foreign exchange risk. In order to better manage the importation of seafood and meat products from New Zealand and Norway, we co-founded Primex. For the year ended March 31, 2021, purchases from Primex amounted to €51.7 million, or 5.1% of our purchases (by value) (compared with €45.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2020 (5.4% of our purchases (by value)) and €43.3 million for the year ended March 31, 2019 (5.4% of our purchases (by value)).",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

357,Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.15,Quality Control,18.15.1,,"We are strongly committed to the quality and safety of our products which are attributes recognized by our customers. We apply stringent standards to surpass legal requirements and we employed a quality control team of 26 full-time employees (as of March 31, 2021) based out of Nemours and Issy-les-Moulineaux in France. This team is responsible for monitoring the quality and safety of our products. Their role includes: - monitoring international sanitary conditions and developments in order to anticipate issues with respect to the use or origin of certain products; 124 ----- - instituting and enforcing strict guidelines which our suppliers must follow and performing random spot checks each year of our suppliers’ production plants or with our suppliers of unprocessed products; - performing additional internal controls such as testing deliveries to our warehouses and collecting samples in our stores; and - conducting laboratory analyses geared at detecting, for example, genetically modified organisms or pesticides, as well as DNA tests on meat and fish products since March 2013 (since February 2013 for beef products). We performed 65,000 tests in the calendar year 2020, in addition to systematic analyses performed by our suppliers. We test our products for bacteria, radioactivity, heavy metals, additives, GMO, species (DNA), weight, ingredients, taste and texture, and as a result of these tests, we rejected approximately 1.12% of processed products before they were shipped to our warehouses. As our tests are performed throughout the cold chain cycle, we may also reject products at various other points in the chain. We believe these tests are essential to the quality and reputation of our brand, and that we are able to effectively monitor the quality and safety of all our products. Our testing practices are often more stringent than required by current regulation. In addition, all of our suppliers must be certified by either ISO 22000, IFS, BRC, or by the external audit firm Bureau Veritas. Our quality control plan regarding scientific activities and international sanitary alerts evolves each year. This is done in order to anticipate potential crises and be in a position to provide quick and adequate answers to them if they do materialize. The horsemeat incident which took place in February 2013 further reinforced the merits of DNA tests (Polymerase Chain Reaction) in identifying different species. These tests are now systematically performed on our beef products and a reinforced control plan is in place for our seafood, fish and other meat products. We also aim to conduct regular audits of each of our suppliers and this audit program has also been reinforced by ensuring strict compliance with our specifications and, in particular, by ensuring that ingredients are correctly pre-validated by our quality service (in terms of quality and origin). The audits are conducted by a team of internal auditors and by certified third-party organizations. Despite our strict quality controls, we may need to recall certain of our products as a result of alterations or contaminations. For instance, we recalled some of our products in late 2013 in Italy when traces of Hepatitis A were allegedly found in a batch of our red berries mix, although tests conducted in public and private laboratories showed no contamination. We have fully implemented our integrated SAP platform in all of our stores, and all lots produced by our suppliers are logged into a system for tracking both delivery and quality controls. This platform enables us to more easily track each lot and perform our controls. Our quality control tests are decisive such that products are only purchased and delivered to our stores if they meet the test specifications. Our competitors, suppliers and customers are aware of our very high cold chain standards. We go beyond the statutory cold chain requirements to ensure the safety of our products for our customers and equip our stores with modern freezing equipment.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We also have an expanding network of franchised stores comprising 22 stores in mainland France, two in Corsica, two in the French West Indies, 15 in Japan, ten in La Réunion, two in New Caledonia, nine in Sweden and one in Norway as of March 31, 2021. Following the sale of our Italian operations, we also provide New Food, the buyer of our Italian operations, with Picard-branded products, which it sells in 45 stores in Italy. In addition, we also provide our Japanese partner with Picard products, currently sold in nine franchised stores located in Japan. Additionally, we sell a limited range of products in the United Kingdom through a commercial agreement with Ocado, a grocery home delivery service, and Marks & Spencer; in Singapore through a commercial agreement with RedMart; in Sweden and Norway, our former partner, which now operates the Swedish and Norwegian stores as a franchisee following the change in our business model, also operates a partnership with ICA to open corners within ICA’s supermarkets and hypermarkets and, through a partnership with Albert Heijn, a number of Picard products are offered in Albert Heijn’s supermarkets and hypermarkets in the Netherlands. We also operate Home Delivery in parts of France, Belgium (mainly in and around Brussels), and Spain (only in Barcelona), which allows customers to order by telephone or online. It has been our continuing strategy to offer the same prices and promotions at all of our stores in France and through Home Delivery. 125 ----- _Store Ownership and Leasing_ As of March 31, 2021, we owned 112 of our 1,013 directly-operated stores in mainland France, most of which we acquired historically upon the exercise of purchase options under our financial leases, and we rent the remaining 901 directly-operated stores. Most of our leased stores in France are leased pursuant to “commercial leases” (baux commerciaux) which grant significant rights under French law to lessees compared to leases in many other jurisdictions. Most of these commercial leases are for nine-year terms (the statutory minimum) and provide termination rights for the tenant at the end of each three-year period upon six-month prior notice. Three of our stores in mainland France are leased pursuant to finance leases (credits-baux), which typically provide for a purchase option after a term of 12 years. We believe that our leasing strategy gives us a high level of flexibility in store management. In the year ended March 31, 2021 our total group rental expenses amounted to €65.8 million. We rent our stores from a variety of landlords, including individuals and different types of companies. The table below sets out our commercial lease expirations in mainland France, Belgium and Luxembourg as at March 31, 2021.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.17,Calendar year** **Number of leases** **% of total leases,18.17.1,Stores in mainland France,"Our stores (which are equipped with closed freezers) emphasize quality, cleanliness and customer service. Picard stores have an average size of approximately 236 square meters and employ on average between three and four full-time employees. We aim, to the extent possible, to give our stores a uniform appearance and refurbish them every six to twelve years (in the last three years, approximately 224 of our stores were refurbished). Our stores are usually open from 9:00 a.m. to 7:30 p.m., except in Paris where they are usually open from 9:00 a.m. to 8:00 or 8:30 p.m., and most of them open on Sunday mornings. Our network of stores covers the whole of mainland France. Our largest concentration of stores is in Paris and Ile-de-France (the area in and around Paris), where we have a total of 365 stores (36.0% of our French store network) as of March 31, 2021, including 122 in Paris. We also have a strong presence in other urban areas, including 39 stores around Lyon, 42 around Marseille and Aix en Provence, 39 around Nice, Antibes and Cannes, 31 around Toulouse and 26 in the Bordeaux region. In recent years, our presence in the southwest region of France has been growing rapidly. We believe the size of our network is a significant barrier to entry. In the year ended March 31, 2021, our average sales per store were €1.6 million and our average sales per square meter, representing our average sales per store divided by our stores’ average surface, was approximately €6,900. Despite our expansion, the opening of new stores has not materially reduced our average sales per store. Average sales per store during the first 12 months of operation amounted to approximately €1.0 million. The economics of our stores are relatively homogeneous across our network in France. 126 ----- _Format_ We have standardized our stores into four formats: pedestrian, urban, traffic area and hypermarkets, each of which is chosen as a function of location and customer profile in order to maximize sales. This standardized format means that set-up costs are predictable and relatively low. As of March 31, 2021, our pedestrian stores represented 26% of our network and are located in dense urban areas within walking distance for most of our customers. Our urban stores represented 16% of our network and have private parking lots. Our traffic stores comprised 34% of our network, are located along regional main roads and have private parking lots. Finally, our hypermarket stores accounted for 24% of our network, are the largest of our four store formats and are typically located on the outskirts of large and medium-sized cities. Pedestrian and urban stores are proximity (or convenience) stores, where customers generally shop once a week and purchase in smaller quantities (the average basket amount is approximately €16.4 and €23.3, respectively, in the year ended March 31, 2020, and approximately €19.1 and €26.3, respectively, in the year ended March 31, 2021). Traffic areas and hypermarket stores are destination stores, where customers generally shop two to three times a month and purchase in larger quantities (the average basket amount is approximately €28.1 and €28.7, respectively, in the year ended March 31, 2020, and approximately €31.1 and €31.6, respectively, in the year ended March 31, 2021). During the COVID-19 pandemic, the frequency of visits to our stores may have varied at different points in time. Our unique concept of stores, where starters are placed near the store’s entrance and desserts by the check-out, allows customers to naturally shop for a typical three-course meal by walking through the store without the need for shopping lists. This concept has a number of advantages. It encourages customers to discover our entire product range, attracts customers to promotions placed at the entrance of the store, reduces wasted time for customers by helping them to more easily find what they are looking for, allows for easy flow within a store and optimizes space allocation. Since November 2018, we have been testing a new store concept, called “Vision”. It mainly features modernized and higher quality equipment (including wood veneers on freezers), clearer signage and communication and a redesigned customer path to further improve the shopping experience of our customers and enhance the conviviality of our stores. This store concept was recognized by the French Design Institute (“Institut Français du Design – Prix Janus”). We launched this concept in November 2018, which has received positive feedback from our customers. Since then, we have remodeled or opened 187 stores according to this new concept, as of March 31, 2021. This initial roll-out confirmed the quality of the concept and the positive impact of this format on Picard’s results. Therefore we plan on continuing to develop the “Vision” concept and improving the format of our stores to further increase our sales. Once the “Vision” concept is finalized, we will begin largescale roll-out into our stores. _Positioning_ Our stores have a well-balanced geographical footprint and are mostly located in high-traffic locations in cities of 25,000 inhabitants or more. Positioning our stores in target catchment areas is a critical part of our ability to reach and serve our customer base. We position our stores and identify locations for expansion according to a demographic analysis we call “geomarketing”, which allows us to analyze data from our network of existing stores and French demographic surveys in order to locate areas with untapped potential and priority zones for new development sites. The principal criteria we use to choose the locations of our new stores are: - population density, which is adjusted for urban and non-urban areas; - average taxable income per household; and - socio-economics of potential customers. We also monitor our market share and revenues in our currently covered areas. We believe that our geomarketing tools allow us to see our market as a whole, to benchmark stores and evaluate the key factors to stores’ success. Geomarketing operations are conducted by a team of four, headed by our director of development and based at our headquarters in Issy-les-Moulineaux. Our objective is to become an everyday destination for our clients to ensure high and constant traffic in stores. The majority of our customers are between the ages of 35 and 65, with an average age of approximately 55. Our younger customers tend to purchase our products for their premium quality and serve them at parties. When these customers reach their thirties, they often develop into regular daily consumers of our products as their buying power increases and they search for convenient and quality food to serve their families. 127 ----- _Expansion_ We continually seek opportunities to expand our store network in France and have opened on average 40 new stores from the year ended March 31, 2002 to the year ended March 31, 2012 and an average of 20 new stores since March 31, 2012 (both directly-operated and franchised stores). We opened 12 and 14 new stores during the years ended March 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively, and, despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, opened 17 new stores in the year ended March 31, 2021. The greater density of our store network results in a limited degree of sales cannibalization which we regularly monitor. Over the past two years, we continued the expansion of our network while successfully maintaining a cannibalization effect on our like-for-like sales of less than 0.5%. Our track record of opening stores without significant cannibalization is the result of a selective store expansion policy implemented by a dedicated team of 12 employees. On average, cannibalization has a short-term negative impact on sales of impacted stores, which resume their long-term trend line growth after one year and recover their initial sales level after two to four years. We believe that there remains potential to open approximately 200 stores during the next decade, based on a criteria and growth strategy, in line with historical expansion, albeit at a slower pace. Since our first store opening in 1974 until March 31, 2021, we have only closed a total of 30 stores in France, out of which seven were closed in the last five years. Also, we have been able to locate more potential new store locations than the currently envisaged additional store openings. In addition to our external growth strategy, Picard has also begun to focus its expansion strategy on franchised stores in smaller cities in France where we do not have a presence. We opened our first franchised store in mainland France in August 2015. Since then, we have opened more than 19 additional franchised stores in mainland France. We believe that the further implementation of our franchised store model will increase brand awareness, while helping us negotiate better terms with our suppliers through increased volumes, with no or limited additional capital expenditures. Under the franchisee model, the franchises operate stores that primarily sell Picard-branded frozen food products. The existing franchised stores are, and any future franchised stores are expected to be, operated by the relevant franchisee and in a similar manner to the way we operate our directly-operated stores in mainland France. Although we generally choose the location for new stores and try to maintain a certain degree of collaboration with our franchisees, franchisees retain control over the operation of the franchised stores and operate in an independent manner with respect to certain aspects of their businesses.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Our renewed or new commercial lease agreements are subject to the ILC, with the remainder being subject to the ICC until their termination date. In the year ended March 31, 2021, the automatic adjustments in the ICC and ILC led to an increase of approximately €0.9 million, or 1.7%, in our invoiced rents. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our _Business—We rent most of our stores pursuant to commercial leases that may be subject to adjustments that could increase our expenses and have a negative impact on our profitability and results of operations”._ In addition, in accordance with applicable regulations governing commercial leases, commercial rents can be adjusted upon the renewal of the lease, failing which, in the case of some of our leases, new rents may be determined by a competent court.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

357,Offerings 2021.md,18,INDUSTRY,18.25,Corsica,18.25.1,Digital strategy and Home Delivery,"Our stores remain and are expected to remain the main sales channel. However, in the past few years, we have been accelerating our digital strategy, offering our customers the possibility of ordering online, on our website or through the “Picard app”, as well as from our legacy catalogue home delivery service. Our website allows customers to order food online and we have two call centers accepting customer telephone orders. Home Delivery was used by approximately 349,000 active customers in the year ended March 31, 2021 and serves customers in densely populated areas in France, as well as in certain areas of Belgium (Brussels) and Spain (Barcelona). Through Home Delivery, our products are offered at retail store prices, plus a €5 to €6 delivery fee. Three outsourced warehouses prepare and distribute products to our 21 Home Delivery regional bases. Orders are then delivered to our customers from these regional bases by leased delivery vans or by partners who are specialists of ‘last mile’ delivery services. In the year ended March 31, 2021, Home Delivery sales (excluding delivery fees) were €58.9 million, representing 3.3% of our total sales. Our Home Delivery sales channel experienced strong growth during the national lockdown in France. The strong rise in Home Delivery sales has been observed throughout the market, as this service has been considered as safe and convenient by customers during the lockdown period. At Picard, digital orders increased by 104.1% when compared to the previous fiscal year, and the COVID-19 pandemic has led us to actively promote the Home Delivery channel for customers. We believe that digital orders will continue to represent a significant portion of the market after the pandemic and will allow customers to increase the amount they spend at Picard in total. Therefore, we have started to develop the platforms that will accompany our growth in the digital segment and have turned our communication strategy into a digital strategy. Accordingly, we launched in June 2020 a new website which comprises serving suggestions and recipe plans along with a broad range of information about our products, and is intended to act both as a showcase for our entire range of Picard products and drive customers to our stores as well as to provide a user-friendly e-commerce site that is another efficient channel through which to buy Picard products. Further, we are working on a new mobile app to replace the one launched in 2016, that will be more modern and convenient and will serve the same goal to promote our brand and encourage customers to shop at Picard under our various available channels. In addition, we extended our delivery footprint to the whole French territory in October 2020 by signing a partnership with a new supplier “Chronofresh”. As part of our digital strategy, in 2020, we also introduced our new Click & Collect program which had a positive impact on our sales performance (€0.8 million in December 2020 in about 160 stores). This new program allows our customers to select and pay for their items online, and then pick them up in store. We now plan to offer Click & Collect for most of the stores in our network. We believe that our renewed attention to this sales channel, especially through recent changes to our website and expected updates to our app, will enhance its consumer appeal and strengthen customer loyalty, increase spending per customer and allow us to reach new customers. Moreover, we believe that Home Delivery sales will directly benefit from our CRM program and our more digitalized communication tools and advertising strategy. _Stores outside of mainland France_ In line with our strategy of further overseas and international expansion, we have opened a number of Picard stores and/or sell Picard-branded products through several different business models outside of mainland France and we are considering further expanding into other countries and regions in the future. In the past, we developed our international network by opening new stores and points of sales in different countries. More recently, we have prioritized different business models abroad that will help build brand awareness and capture customers, while also minimizing our capital expenditure and fixed costs. For example, we typically enter into partnerships with local retailers to develop “corners” in their stores. If the initial results are positive, we may then explore the possibility of operating through multiple channels in such countries, including through opening franchised stores in those markets. _Corsica, the French West Indies, La Réunion and New Caledonia_ In French overseas territories, where we already have high brand awareness, we are working with partners who open franchises similar to the stores we have in France. We opened two franchised stores in Corsica in the years ended March 31, 2012 and 2013, two franchised stores in the French West Indies during the years ended March 31, 2018 and 2019 and ten stores in La Réunion, a French overseas department, since January 2013. Two franchised stores opened in New Caledonia in March 2021; a third store opened in April 2021. 129 ----- _Belgium and Luxembourg_ We opened our first directly-operated stores in Belgium in the year ended March 31, 2013 and have reached a total of 14 stores in Belgium as at March 31, 2020. Our expansion in Belgium targets Wallonia, rather than Flanders. Our activities in Belgium have become a completely profitable business unit through a significant growth in the customer base. We aim to continue our expansion in Belgium, and a new store opened in Namur in May 2021. We also opened our first store in Luxembourg in October 2014. Our stores in Belgium and Luxembourg are directly operated by Picard, and are operated in a similar manner to our stores in mainland France. _Japan_ We opened our first franchised stores in Japan in 2017. During the year ended March 31, 2020, we opened five franchised stores in Japan with our local partner, Aeon, bringing the total to 14 franchised stores in Japan. Prior to opening stores in Japan and since October 2015, the first step of our partnership consisted in offering our products in several “corners” in some of Aeon’s hypermarkets in Tokyo. “Corners” are areas in department stores or hypermarkets dedicated to Picard-branded products and which display the Picard brand name and logo. _Scandinavia_ In the year ended March 31, 2013, we opened our first directly-operated store in Sweden and continued to expand our store network to reach a total of 15 stores in Sweden as at December 31, 2017. However, after having closed several stores in Sweden, we took the decision to change our business model in Sweden in order to create value for the Group. Therefore, we sold our Swedish operations to our joint-venture partner as of August 15, 2018. Concurrently with the disposal of our Swedish business, we entered into a five-year franchise agreement pursuant to which the buyer will continue the development of the business in Sweden through various channels, including the contract with ICA and franchised stores, while the Group will supply Picard-branded products to the buyer for such purposes. In the year ended March 31, 2020, we opened our first franchised store in Norway. Going forward, our strategy in Scandinavia will be geared towards supporting our local partner in the development of both franchised stores and partnerships with local retailers. _Italy_ In 1999, we acquired Gelmarket S.p.A., the Italian subsidiary of Gel 2000 International S.A., a French distributor of frozen products then in administrative receivership, which became our subsidiary Picard Surgelati. This acquisition constituted our first international store expansion. Picard Surgelati’s network at the time of the acquisition was comprised of 45 stores in the North of Italy and oriented towards a discount-focused clientele. On April 10, 2015, the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer entered into a share purchase agreement with New Food for the purchase by New Food of the entire share capital of Picard Surgelati. The closing of this transaction occurred on May 13, 2015. Following the completion of this transaction, and further to a commercial agreement between Picard and New Food, Picard sells Picard-branded products to New Food in its 45 stores in Northern Italy. The current contract is effective until December 31, 2021. _United Kingdom_ In October 2016, we began offering Picard-branded products in the United Kingdom through a partnership with Ocado, the grocery home delivery service. Since that date, we have renewed our agreement with Ocado each year, while increasing the number of SKUs supplied to Ocado under our partnership. We offer an extensive range of frozen food products through Ocado and intend to consolidate and develop this partnership, which enables us to increase our brand awareness in the United Kingdom. In addition, we also increased our footprint in the United Kingdom, due to a partnership signed with Marks & Spencer, under which they have been selling our products in their stores since July 2020. _The Netherlands_ Following an agreement entered into in January 2018, a number of Picard products are offered in certain Albert Heijn supermarkets and hypermarkets in the Netherlands. Our products are available in nearly 300 stores as well as through the online grocery offer at www.ah.nl. The offer of Picard products features ready-made meals, an extensive range of drinks and various appetizers and desserts. 130 ----- _Switzerland (closed)_ We opened our first franchised store in Switzerland with a commercial partner in March 2015 and our franchisee operated six franchised stores in Switzerland until early January 2020, when such stores were closed following the commencement of bankruptcy proceedings in respect of our franchisee. _Singapore_ In January 2020, we began offering Picard-branded products in Singapore through a partnership with RedMart, one of the main online retailers in Singapore.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The entirety of our logistics operations is outsourced (except for the final 131 ----- delivery of our products from warehouses to customers as part of our Home Delivery), providing us with greater flexibility. Orders to suppliers are centrally managed by our procurement department, based on monthly sales forecasts for each product. Each store is responsible for placing its own orders which are subsequently processed by our centralized logistics and transportation department. _Cold chain_ We believe that the strength of our logistics network is critical to the freshness of our products, quality control and customer satisfaction. To this end, we have established a high-standard cold chain to keep our products at temperatures of –18°C or less, with an ambient temperature in trucks of –22°C. These requirements apply at all stages of our logistics operations, including during the preparation and transport of our products by our suppliers. _Warehousing_ Our substantial distribution network consists of eight distribution centers for stores, three of which also serve our Home Delivery channel. In France, as of March 31, 2021, we stored our products in eight warehouses (seven for frozen food and one for grocery in Nemours), three of which are located in the Paris area, where our largest concentration of stores is located. All our warehouses in France are outsourced to our logistics partners: STEF (the leading French company in frozen storage and transportation) and SOFRICA/SOFRILOG (the number two frozen storage specialist in France). Five of these warehouses are dedicated to serving our retail stores (Villeneuve sur Lot, Mions, Rennes, Trappes, and Nemours), while the other three warehouses (Cergy, Sorgues and Vitry) serve both our retail stores and Home Delivery. In addition, Home Delivery distribution is processed through 21 logistics bases, consisting of cross dock platforms.

Since we launched our first organic products in 1998, we have significantly expanded the number and range of organic products we offer and have improved the visibility of organic products in-store with dedicated freezer compartments and an easily identifiable trademark for our organic products (“Le Bio par Picard”). In addition, we have increased our fish and seafood supply from sources that are third-party certified as sustainable in recent years, including Marine Stewardship Council (“MSC”) labeled products and Aquaculture Stewardship Council (“ASC”) labeled products. Our other commitments for more responsible consumption include focusing on animal welfare (for example, by targeting having all our egg-based products made from cage-free eggs by 2025), sustainable farming (for example, by prioritizing products made in France when possible) and healthy eating (for example, by reducing the levels of salt, saturated fat and hidden sugars). In 2019, we hired a project manager who is in charge of responsible purchasing and animal welfare. In addition, at the beginning of 2020, Picard committed to reducing our plastic packaging by reducing both the thickness of packaging and by replacing plastic with other materials. The work of our product development teams has enabled us to reduce the plastic used in our packaging by 325 tonnes in calendar year 2020, a 4% reduction as compared to calendar years 2018 and 2019 despite increases in volumes. We are aiming to use 100% recyclable plastic by 2025 (compared with 71% today). We are continuing work on our eco-design approach to packaging with the following priorities: reducing the weight of materials, researching and using materials from renewable resources (to limit the use of fossil fuels in production), avoiding over-packaging (while guaranteeing strict compliance with food safety) and the use of “all-in-one” containers. We are also considering ways to improve energy efficiency in our stores and to reduce carbon emissions from our shipping networks and logistics chains. Regarding energy management, we first obtained an ISO 50001 certification in 2016 for all our stores in France and our fish and seafood processing facility and have been regularly re-certified since then; we also reduced our in-store electricity consumption by approximately 10% between 2012 and 2019. Regarding our carbon footprint, we joined the “FRET 21” program in 2020, and have committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions generated by transport of our goods by at least 10% within three years. In accordance with our newly-established Sustainability Performance Targets, we aim to reduce energy consumption by our stores by 6% by December 31, 2023 (as compared to our 2020 baseline) and carbon emissions from our shipping networks and logistics chains by 10% by December 31, 2023 (as compared to our 2019 baseline). In addition, 100% of the energy consumed by our stores currently comes from renewable sources. Our employees are also at the center of our commitment to corporate social responsibility and sustainability. We have invested in advanced equipment such as our frost-free freezers and in new store designs to minimize strenuous tasks and improve safety for our staff. In October 2018, we entered into an agreement on equality and quality of life at work, which was signed by all trade unions of which our employees are members; this agreement has a four-year term, and reinforces our corporate policies, including with respect to equality during the recruitment process and better integration of employees with disabilities. 133 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The objective of the department is to align our communication and customer strategy. This department encompasses our communication, digital marketing (including our CRM department) and commercial strategy teams, as well as the Home Delivery department. In addition, we have recently recruited a new Head of Communications and a new Marketing Director. Our goal with respect to the development of consumer loyalty is to increase our interaction with customers with the aim of enhancing the consumer’s commitment to benefit our brand. To enhance the consumer’s commitment to our brand, we launched in May 2015 an interactive platform to better understand clients’ needs and purchasing mechanisms and to increase the frequency of purchase of our products, as well as reinforce the client’s commitment to the brand. This platform relies on four pillars: - Reconciling all different sales channels in order to have a more precise understanding of the purchasing mechanisms used, thus enabling us to focus on clients’ needs and consumption habits; - Gathering the maximum information on our clients, their prospects, their centers of interests and expectations with respect to Picard by leveraging social networks; - Actively contributing to the business with a return on investment modeled to include both a relational dimension and a transactional dimension, aiming to offer rewards and incentives to our customers; and - Presenting a clear and simple approach for the client while being flexible and using both a test and learn and a step-by-step approach. After the first step initiated in May 2015, we are further investing in our CRM to offer our customers a complete relationship program relying on a more targeted and personalized approach, which is based on the knowledge and experience acquired in the past few years. In line with this strategy, we launched the “Picard et _moi” customer loyalty program on October 16, 2017. Through the customer loyalty program, we aim to build_ more meaningful and customized promotional offers to our customers. Since its launch, our loyalty program has grown rapidly with 8.2 million customers having joined the program as of December 31, 2020. In calendar year 2020, we acquired 1.0 million new loyalty card members, which, taking into consideration the number of customers who stopped shopping with us, meant a net gain of 0.3 million. This trend has continued since, and we have acquired more than 0.3 million new loyalty card members during the first five and a half months of calendar year 2021. In addition to our CRM, we continue to focus on advertising, which is an integral part of the promotion of our products, our stores and our brand. Our preferred methods of advertising are our monthly home mailings, newsletters, catalogues, in-store signage, billboards, daily regional press, radio and television. Since the summer of 2013, we have multiplied our communication campaigns by using different advertisement platforms as well as by increasing the number of advertisements. In addition to strengthening our online presence, we reintroduced television advertisements in April 2014. In the year ended March 31, 2021, we spent €36.0 million in France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Scandinavia, or 2.0% of our sales of goods, on advertising. We spent a total of €34.8 million and €32.4 million on advertising in France in the years ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. However, despite these relatively low advertising and promotion expenditures, we continue to grow and enjoy one of the best brand awareness among French retailers. Our annual advertising budget focuses on increasing the number of customers visiting our stores. Our TV advertising enhances our visibility to our customers and emphasizes the quality of our products. This is illustrated by two new advertisements, broadcasted on TV and online. One focuses on Picard’s organic range, which has grown considerably in recent years and now offers a range of gourmet products from starters to desserts. The second one showcases the full variety and creativity of our range of ice creams, with a focus on the natural ingredients. In 2019, our TV advertising campaigns were broadcast in three three-week waves (July, September and January) and television became that year the principal advertising medium employed by Picard. We also use commercial campaigns to increase traffic to our stores and retail opportunities and improve our strategic competitive positioning in terms of “le plaisir de bien-manger” (the pleasure of eating well). We run approximately 25 commercial campaigns each year, aimed at increasing interest among our customers, and these 134 ----- include mainly five festive campaigns for which Picard is considered as a leader (Christmas, New Year’s Eve, la _gallette des rois or kings’ cake, Valentine’s Day and Easter), four purely promotional campaigns, several_ “Gourmet escapades” around the world (such as “Ciao Italia” or “Hello America”) and campaigns focusing on eating well (for instance promoting organic food and sustainable fishing). In our stores, these campaigns translate into a product offering adapted to the relevant campaign, which comprises approximately 20 products positioned in the first two freezers of our stores and which is modified every two weeks on average. In addition, approximately 55 products (160 products in December) are presented in a “selection of the month” promotion that lasts between four to eight weeks and is changed 12 times a year. Promotions are set nationally without differentiation among regions. Every campaign is supported by in-store communication, CRM and online advertising. Catalogues remain an essential tool. The number of copies distributed (several million) can be adjusted to suit the challenges that are being faced. Outdoor displays are also highly effective as they communicate the indulgent nature of Picard’s product range. Radio is also used to generate traffic, particularly in provincial France. The stores themselves are also a medium of communication. The gradual roll-out of the “Vision” concept, which is modern, inspirational and warm, improves the customer experience and invites them to discover Picard products. Due to these efforts, Picard remains one of France’s favorite brands in the food sector, with a Net Promoter Score (NPS), which is an index that measures the willingness of customers to recommend a company’s products or services to others, that has increased year-by-year in recent years. Finally, as part of our strategy, we aim to make Picard a more powerful and differentiated brand, improving sales and brand awareness among customers. In March 2021, we launched a new brand campaign, focusing on our products and the way customers consume Picard products. In particular, this new brand campaign highlights the advantages of frozen food compared to fresh, and of Picard compared to other frozen food brands. This new brand campaign includes a one-minute television advertisement. In addition, we have updated our tagline “Pour _le bon et le meilleur”._",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The URSSAF audit covered our social security contributions in France for the calendar years 2014 to 2016. The URSSAF alleges that we applied erroneous methods of calculation for various social security contributions, including with respect to the computation of the “allègements Fillon” reductions. The amount of the reassessment for the calendar years 2014 to 2016 is €4.3 million, plus an additional €0.5 million as penalties for late payment.

European Directive No. 89/108 dated December 21, 1988 (amended by European Directive 2006/107 dated November 20, 2006) establishes the general European regulatory framework for the trade and manufacture of frozen foods. European Directive No. 92/2 dated January 13, 1992 and Regulation 37/2005 dated January 12, 2005 set out specific technical measures for the implementation of the framework established by Directive No. 89/108.

In France, frozen food products must (i) be of a certain freshness when frozen, (ii) be frozen through a “quick-freezing” process, (iii) always be maintained at temperatures below –18°C, from the time the products are frozen until they reach the consumer and (iv) be free of pathogenic bacteria and comply with bacteriologic conditions set by the French Department of Agriculture and the French Department of Health.

Articles L.145-1 et seq. automatically apply when the lease is granted for commercial, industrial or handcraft activity; when the tenant is running its business from the premises; and when the tenant is registered with the Trade and Companies Registries. Most of our stores are subject to Articles L.145-1 et seq. and R.145-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code, which give the tenant certain rights (in particular the right to renew a lease agreement). Save for the short-term leases subject to Article L.145-5, commercial leases last a minimum of nine years, but rarely exceed twelve years as commercial leases of initial term exceeding twelve years must be notarized and registered with the relevant Land Registry and will be subject to “TPF” tax assessed on the cumulated amount of the rents + service charges + taxes borne by the tenant for the lease term with a maximum of 20 years. The tenant has the right to terminate a commercial lease every three years subject to a minimum prior notice of six months served by bailiff or by letter with acknowledgement of receipt, although this right can be carved out by the parties when (i) the initial term of the lease exceeds nine years; or when the lease has been granted for (ii) a specific single purpose (i.e., those built or altered for a specialized purpose rendering them unsuitable for another use without alteration); (iii) for office use only; or (iv) for storage use. The landlord may only terminate the lease at the end of each three-year period if he (i) specifically intends to build, rebuild, (ii) intends to raise the height of the existing premises, (iii) has obtained a permit to build a dwelling on all or part of a ground rented bare or (iv) needs to carry out work requiring the evacuation of buildings located in protected sectors or real estate restoration operations or, at any time during the lease, if a tenant defaults on the lease obligations described in the lease agreement. At the end of the contractual term of the lease, the tenant is entitled to have the lease renewed. If the landlord does not grant such renewal, unless the landlord can show good cause (usually the tenant’s non-compliance with the terms of the lease agreement), he will be liable to compensate the tenant for the loss. This compensation must correspond to the harm suffered by the tenant and include all losses suffered and expenses incurred as a result of his having to move to other premises. Upon expiration of the lease agreement, if the landlord and tenant take no action to renew or to terminate the lease, the original lease will be tacitly extended until a notice of termination or a request of renewal is served by either the tenant or the landlord. When the lease is tacitly extended, the parties can terminate the lease at any time by giving a 6 months’ notice with effect at the end of the relevant calendar quarter. During this period, the tenant and landlord can at any time freely negotiate and sign a new lease. Unless the parties agree otherwise, the duration of this new lease will be nine years and the other terms and conditions of the expired lease will apply to the new lease. The parties are free to set the initial rent, generally according to the current market value of the property. The rent may be fixed or variable (determined by reference to a certain percentage of turnover at the leased premises) or both (i.e., composed of a fixed portion (a guaranteed minimum) and a variable portion). The rent may also be fixed according to steps rent. This rent is subject to review during the term of the lease. There are two ways of rent revision: the statutory rent review and the rent indexation clause. Rent revision. Generally, an annual rent (upwards / downwards) indexation clause is included in the lease. The agreed index must have some connection with the activity carried out by one of the parties or with the object of the lease as per the provisions of the French Monetary and Financial Code. Most of our commercial leases refer to the Construction Cost Index (ICC) published by INSEE. However, French law No. 2014-626, dated June 18, 2014 (“Loi Pinel”) deleted any reference to the ICC in the provisions related to rent indexation in the French Commercial Code but not in the French Monetary and Financial Code. Therefore, although the ICC may still be used for annual rent indexation in commercial leases, our lease agreements concluded or renewed after September 1, 2014, only refer to the ILC, in line with current common practice. Furthermore, commercial lease regulation provides for possible statutory rent review (which is a mandatory public order regulation) every three years so as to correspond to the rental value, but without exceeding the variation in the quarterly ILC or ILAT index, as applicable, published since the last rent review, unless a material change in local economic factors has modified the rental value of the leased premises by more than 10%. Being specified that in theory, the amount of the reviewed rent must correspond to the “valeur locative” (rental value) which in the absence of agreement between the parties is determined by the Courts, taking into 139 ----- account: the characteristics of the premises; the permitted use and activities; the respective obligations of the parties; the local commercial factors (factors which affect businesses in that area generally); and rental levels in the area. Moreover, if the lease provides for annual rent indexation, the rent may be subject to review to correspond to the then applicable rental value (“valeur locative”) by a judge if it increases or decreases by more than 25% compared to the amount previously agreed to by the parties or determined by the court, by reason of such indexation. The Loi Pinel encourages the use of the ILC for the indexation of the rent of eligible leases entered into by tenants for commercial or artisanal activities. This index aims to smooth out the yearly increase of rents compared to the ICC. Similarly, the Loi Pinel encourages the use of the ILAT for the indexation of the rent of eligible leases entered into by tenants for tertiary activities. Parties to eligible leases are free to choose the index to be applied (subject to the provisions of Article L.112-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code). Rent of renewed lease. Except for leases providing for a variable rent, pursuant to Article L.145-33 of the French Commercial Code, in the absence of any agreement between the parties, the new rent will be determined by a competent court by applying Articles L.145-1 et seq. and R.145-1 et seq. of the French Commercial Code. The new rent will correspond to the rental value (“valeur locative”) determined by the court, taking into consideration the nature and possible uses of the premises, the parties’ obligations under the lease and commercial factors such as location, neighboring businesses, proximity to transport routes and comparable local rents. However, the new rent cannot be higher than the original rent, as adjusted according to the variation of the ILC or ILAT index, as applicable, since the date on which the rent in the original lease was set. As a result, the rent fixed for the new lease can be less than current market rates. The ceiling will not apply if there have been significant changes to the parties’ obligations or the nature, use or environment of the premises in the interim. The cap rule will also not apply to: (i) leases for office use only; (ii) leases of premises built for a specific single purpose (i.e., those built or altered for a specialized purpose rendering them unsuitable for another use without alteration); (iii) leases of an initial term of nine years but which, due to automatic extension, have an effective term of more than twelve years; and (iv) leases with initial terms that exceed nine years. For the commercial leases concluded or renewed since September 2014, and for which the ceiling does not apply if the elements constituting the rental value have been altered or for a reason related to the duration of the lease, the variation of the rent cannot result in a change of 10% or more, during the year, as compared with the rent paid during the last year.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The applicable CICE rate, which amounted to 7% of gross compensation in 2017, has been reduced to 6% in 2018 by the 2018 French Finance Law. The amount of the CICE is calculated on the basis of gross salaries paid in the course of the calendar year to employees whose wages are below 2.5 times the French statutory minimum wage. Pursuant to the terms of the CICE scheme, an employee’s gross salary is calculated on the basis of such employee’s normal working hours plus such employee’s overtime hours. The amounts paid under profitsharing agreements are also not included in the employee’s gross salary for the purpose of calculating CICE. The CICE had a positive impact on our EBITDA. The CICE was repealed as from January 1, 2019.

Unless the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Fixed Rate SSNs as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of _Control Offer”), copied to the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee, to each holder of the Fixed Rate SSNs at such holder’s_ registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection _and Notice,” stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Fixed Rate SSNs on_ the date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture and described in such notice. The Fixed Rate SSN Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations, including administrative interpretations thereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, no-action letters issued by the Commission indicating that the staff of the Commission will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions), to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Fixed Rate SSNs as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture, the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer will comply with any applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture by virtue of such compliance. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Fixed Rate SSNs or portions (equal to €100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of Fixed Rate SSNs properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Fixed Rate SSN Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Fixed Rate SSNs or portions of Fixed Rate SSNs properly tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee the Fixed Rate SSNs properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate SSNs or portions of Fixed Rate SSNs being purchased by the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer. The Fixed Rate SSN Principal Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Fixed Rate SSNs properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Fixed Rate SSNs, and the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will promptly, upon receipt of an authentication order from the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer, authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Fixed Rate SSN equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Fixed Rate SSNs surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Fixed Rate SSN will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Fixed Rate SSN Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. The provisions described above that require the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Fixed Rate SSNs to require that the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer repurchase or redeem the Fixed Rate SSNs in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a holder of the Fixed Rate SSNs’ right to require the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer to repurchase such holder’s Fixed Rate SSNs upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Fixed Rate SSN Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer and purchases all Fixed Rate SSNs properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Fixed 183 ----- Rate SSN Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption”, unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. In addition, the definitions of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. The Fixed Rate SSN Issuer’s ability to repurchase Fixed Rate SSNs pursuant to a Change of Control Offer following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Fixed Rate SSNs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the _Notes—We may not be able to finance a change of control offer and certain transactions will not require us to make a change of control offer”._ The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all”, there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Fixed Rate SSNs to require the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer to repurchase its Fixed Rate SSNs as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. The provisions under the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture relating to the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Fixed Rate SSNs as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Fixed Rate SSNs prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control. If and for so long as the Fixed Rate SSNs are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted for trading on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

If Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale are applied to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer shall be required to retire such Indebtedness or cause the related commitments to be permanently reduced, except in the case of revolving Indebtedness. Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Company (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise use the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture. 185 ----- Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds”.

If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Company may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate SSNs and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds or if the aggregate amount of Fixed Rate SSNs tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of the Net Proceeds so applied, the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee or Fixed Rate SSN Registrar will select the Fixed Rate SSNs and such other _pari passu Indebtedness, if applicable, to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described under_ “—Selection and Notice”), based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred _Stock” covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of_ Indebtedness described in this covenant, the Company, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its Incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such Incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, and from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant, provided that (a) Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Incurred or outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been Incurred on such date pursuant to clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt and may not be reclassified and (b) all Senior Secured Indebtedness Incurred under 190 ----- clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant that is secured by Liens on the Collateral that is accorded super senior priority with respect to proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may not be reclassified. The accrual of interest or Preferred Stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of Preferred Stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-euro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to euro, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the euro-equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the euro-equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally Incurred, except that to the extent that: (1) such euro-equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and (2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the euro-equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being Incurred or on the date as determined under “—Financial _Calculations”, as applicable._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values. For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS; (2) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; (3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be the lesser of: (i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and (ii) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person; (4) (i) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be double-counted and (ii) any guarantee by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Indebtedness Incurred by a Parent Entity, where the net cash proceeds of such Parent Entity Indebtedness are on-lent to the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary as a Parent Debt Proceeds Loan and such Parent Debt Proceeds Loan is otherwise included in the determination of a permitted amount of Indebtedness, shall not be double-counted; (5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (4) or (18) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be double-counted; 191 ----- (6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (7) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing or on the date as determined under “—Financial Calculations”, as applicable, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (8) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof; (9) in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance any other Indebtedness, any Indebtedness Incurred to fund any accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premia and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees or any required additional tax gross-up amounts) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing shall not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred; and (10) in the event that the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (26) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture, including without limitation for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (22) of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any) for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of whether such ratio, test or other provision of the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture is satisfied at the time of such borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness _Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Senior_ Secured Leverage Ratio, or the Consolidated Net Leverage, as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (22) of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Except (subject to the provisions described under “—Amendment, _Supplement and Waiver”) to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or_ Additional Amounts when due, no holder of a Fixed Rate SSN may pursue any remedy with respect to the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture or the Fixed Rate SSNs unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Fixed Rate SSNs have requested the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders have offered the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding); and (5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Fixed Rate SSNs have not given the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. The holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate SSNs outstanding may, on behalf of the holders of all outstanding Fixed Rate SSNs, waive any past Default under the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture and its consequences, except a continuing Default in the payment of the principal or premium, if any, any Additional Amounts or interest on any Fixed Rate SSN held by a non-consenting holder (which may only be waived with the consent of holders of the Fixed Rate SSNs holding 90% of the aggregate principal amount of the Fixed Rate SSNs outstanding under the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture). Holders of Fixed Rate SSNs may not enforce the Fixed Rate SSN Security Documents, except as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Fixed Rate SSN Indenture will provide that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee has written notice, the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Fixed Rate SSN Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture or that the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee determines is materially prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee in personal liability. The Company is required to deliver to the Fixed Rate SSN Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture within 120 days after the end of each financial year. The Fixed 215 ----- Rate SSN Trustee and the Security Agent may assume without inquiry, in the absence of actual knowledge, that the Company and the Fixed Rate SSN Issuer are duly complying with their obligations contained in the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture required to be observed and performed by them, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Fixed Rate SSNs has occurred. The Fixed Rate SSN Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default (a “Subsequent Default”) occurs solely as a result of an action taken while a Default (an “Initial Default”) for a failure to deliver a required certificate (unrelated to the action in respect of the Subsequent Default) is pending and the Initial Default is cured, such Subsequent Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Floating Rate SSN Indenture relating to the calculation of interest on the Floating Rate SSNs. “Calculation Agent” means a financial institution appointed by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer to calculate the interest rate payable on the Floating Rate SSNs in respect of each Interest Period, which shall initially be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. “Determination Date” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period, except that the initial Determination Date will be, 2021. “EURIBOR” means, with respect to an Interest Period, the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum) for deposits in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date that appears on Reuters Page EURIBOR01 as of 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on the Determination Date. If Reuters Page EURIBOR01 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or an agent of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the eurozone inter-bank market, as selected by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or an agent of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per annum) as of approximately 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on such Determination Date, to prime banks in the eurozone inter-bank market for deposits in a Representative Amount in euro for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such offered quotations are so provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or an agent of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer will request each of three major banks in London, as selected by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or an agent of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum), as of approximately 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount in euro to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, EURIBOR for such Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided, then EURIBOR in respect of such Interest Period will be EURIBOR in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period. If the Floating Rate SSN Issuer determines, prior to any Determination Date, that: - there has been a material disruption to EURIBOR; - EURIBOR is not available for use temporarily, indefinitely or permanently; - there are restrictions or prohibitions on the use of EURIBOR; - an alternative rate has replaced EURIBOR in customary market practice in the international capital markets applicable generally to floating rate notes; or - it has become unlawful for the Calculation Agent, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or a third-party agent of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer to calculate any payments due to Holders using EURIBOR, 256 ----- a Rate Determination Agent, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, shall select a successor rate to EURIBOR that is substantially comparable to EURIBOR or that has been recommended or selected by the relevant monetary authority or similar authority (or working group thereof) or by a widely recognized industry association or body or that is expected to develop as an industry accepted rate for debt market instruments such as or comparable to the Floating Rate SSNs (and any applicable adjustment spread required to reduce or eliminate, to the extent reasonably practicable in the circumstances, any economic prejudice or benefit (as the case may be) to Holders as a result of the replacement of EURIBOR (the “Adjustment Spread”)) for use in calculating the Applicable Rate (the “Successor Rate”), and the Floating Rate SSN Issuer shall certify (by way of an Officer’s Certificate in form and substance satisfactory to each of its recipients) to each of the Floating Rate SSN Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Floating Rate SSN Paying Agents, no later than five Business Days prior to any Determination Date, such Successor Rate (and the Adjustment Spread) (upon which each of the Floating Rate SSN Trustee, the Calculation Agent and each Floating Rate SSN Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely conclusively and absolutely without further enquiry, investigation, verification or liability of any kind whatsoever), which shall be used by the Calculation Agent to calculate the Applicable Rate. Holders shall be bound by any such Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread) without any further action or consent by the Holders or the Floating Rate SSN Trustee. For the avoidance of doubt, the sum of the Successor Rate and the Adjustment Spread shall, in all cases, not be less than 0%. The Floating Rate SSN Issuer shall promptly notify the Holders of the adoption of any Successor Rate (and Adjustment Spread). Following the adoption of any Successor Rate and Adjustment Spread, all references to “EURIBOR” in the Floating Rate SSN Indenture shall be deemed to refer to such Successor Rate (and such Adjustment Spread). No Agent shall be obliged to effect any Successor Rate (or Adjustment Spread) if in the sole opinion of such Agent doing so would impose more onerous obligations upon it or its affiliates or expose such parties to any additional duties, responsibilities or liabilities or reduce or amend the protective provisions afforded to such parties. None of the Floating Rate SSN Trustee, the Calculation Agent and the Floating Rate SSN Paying Agents shall be responsible or liable for any action or inaction from the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or (if applicable) the Rate Determination Agent or its (or their) determination of the Successor Rate, Adjustment Spread or other related changes. “euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that at the relevant time have adopted the euro as their official currency. “Rate Determination Agent” means (i) an independent financial institution of international standing or an independent financial adviser of recognized standing (that is not an Affiliate of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer) as appointed by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer at the expense of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or (ii) if it is not reasonably practicable to appoint a party as referred to under (i), the Floating Rate SSN Issuer. “Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time. “Reuters Page EURIBOR01” means the display page so designated on Reuters (or such other page as may replace that page on that service, or, if no such page is available, such other service as may be nominated as the information vendor). “TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET2) System is open for the settlement of payments in euro. The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable on the Floating Rate SSNs in respect of the following Interest Period (the “Interest Amount”) and notify the Floating Rate SSN Issuer in writing thereof. The Interest Amount shall be calculated by applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of the Floating Rate SSNs outstanding on the Determination Date, multiplying each such amount by the actual amount of days in the Interest Period concerned divided by 360; provided, however, that interest shall only be paid in respect of Floating Rate SSNs outstanding on the applicable interest payment date. All percentages resulting from any of the above calculations will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one hundred thousandth of a percentage point, with five one millionths of a percentage point being rounded upwards (e.g., 4.876545% (or .04876545) being rounded to 4.87655% (or .0487655)). All euro amounts used in or resulting from such calculations will be rounded to the nearest euro cent (with one-half euro cent being rounded upwards). The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount 257 ----- by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence of willful default, gross negligence or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of interest on the Floating Rate SSNs be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law; provided, however, that the Calculation Agent shall not be responsible for verifying that the rate of interest on the Floating Rate SSNs is permitted under any applicable law. The Floating Rate SSN Trustee and any Floating Rate SSN Paying Agent shall not be responsible for, nor incur any liability in connection with, any loss resulting from any calculation made, or intended to be made, by the Calculation Agent. The rights of Holders of beneficial interests in the Floating Rate SSNs to receive the payments of interest on such Floating Rate SSNs are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”). If the due date for any payment in respect of any Floating Rate SSNs is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Floating Rate SSN Trustee and the Floating Rate SSN Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. The Floating Rate SSN Issuer or the relevant Floating Rate SSN Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Floating Rate SSN Issuer or the relevant Floating Rate SSN Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Floating Rate SSN Issuer or the relevant Floating Rate SSN Guarantor will furnish to the Floating Rate SSN Trustee (or to a holder upon written request), within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or a Floating Rate SSN Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Floating Rate SSN Trustee) by such entity. If reasonably requested by the Floating Rate SSN Trustee, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or the Floating Rate SSN Guarantors will provide to the Floating Rate SSN Trustee such information as may be in the possession of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or the Floating Rate SSN Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession of the Floating Rate SSN Trustee) to enable the Floating Rate SSN Trustee to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder, _provided, however, that in no event shall the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or the Floating Rate SSN Guarantors be_ required to disclose any information that they reasonably deem to be confidential.

The above obligations will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Floating Rate SSN Indenture, any transfer by a holder or beneficial owner of its Floating Rate SSNs, and will apply, mutatis _mutandis, to any jurisdiction in which any successor Person to the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or any Floating Rate_ SSN Guarantor is incorporated, engaged in business for tax purposes or resident for tax purposes or any jurisdiction from or through which such Person makes any payment on the Floating Rate SSNs (or any Note Guarantee) and any department or political subdivision thereof or therein.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Floating Rate SSN Guarantors. Each Note Guarantee will be a general senior obligation of the relevant Floating Rate SSN Guarantor. Each of the Note Guarantees and the amounts recoverable thereunder will be limited to the maximum amount that can be guaranteed by a particular Floating Rate SSN Guarantor without rendering its guarantee voidable or otherwise ineffective under applicable law. In addition, the Note Guarantee of any Floating Rate SSN Guarantor incorporated under the laws of France (each, a “French Guarantor”) will apply only in so far as required to: (1) guarantee the payment obligations under the Floating Rate SSN Indenture and the Floating Rate SSNs, of its direct or indirect French Subsidiaries which are or become obligors from time to time under the Floating Rate SSN Indenture and the Floating Rate SSNs; and 261 ----- (2) guarantee the payment obligations of other obligors under the Floating Rate SSN Indenture and the Floating Rate SSNs which are not direct or indirect Subsidiaries of that French Guarantor, provided that in such case such Note Guarantee shall be limited at any time: (A) to the payment obligations of such obligors and (B) to an amount equal to the aggregate of all amounts directly or indirectly (by way of intercompany loans or similar arrangements directly or indirectly from the Floating Rate SSN Issuer) received out of the proceeds of any offering of Floating Rate SSNs by such obligors and on-lent directly or indirectly to that French Guarantor and outstanding from time to time (the “Maximum _Guaranteed Amount”); any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Note Guarantee shall_ reduce pro tanto the outstanding amount of the intercompany loans or similar intercompany debt (if any) due by such French Guarantor to that party under the intercompany loan arrangements or similar arrangements referred to above. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Floating Rate SSN Indenture, no French Guarantor shall secure liabilities under the Floating Rate SSN Indenture or the Floating Rate SSNs which would result in such French Guarantor not complying with French financial assistance rules as set out in Article L. 225-216 of the French _Code de Commerce and/or would constitute a misuse of corporate assets within the meaning of Article L. 241-3,_ L. 242-6 or L.244-1 of the French Code de Commerce or any other law or regulations having the same effect, as interpreted by French courts. For a description of such contractual limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and _the Notes—Corporate benefit, financial assistance laws and other limitations on the guarantees may adversely affect the validity and enforceability of the Guarantees of the Senior Secured Notes and the Senior Notes”._ Any payment made by such French Guarantor under its Note Guarantee will reduce the Maximum Guaranteed Amount of its Note Guarantee.

The operations of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries, and therefore the Floating Rate SSN Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Floating Rate SSNs. Not all of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Floating Rate SSNs. The Floating Rate SSNs will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or any Floating Rate SSN Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Floating Rate SSNs to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or such Floating Rate SSN Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or such Floating Rate SSN Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or such Floating Rate SSN Guarantor. As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, including this offering of Floating Rate SSNs and the application of proceeds therefrom, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries would have had no Indebtedness, excluding leases, bank guarantees and trade payables, social charges, employee profit-sharing, taxes and other similar payables.

In the Change of Control Offer, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer will offer a payment in cash equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate SSNs repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, on the Floating Rate SSNs repurchased to the date of purchase (the “Change of Control Payment”), subject to the rights of holders of Floating Rate SSNs on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date. Unless the Floating Rate SSN Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Floating Rate SSNs as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”), copied to the Floating Rate SSN Trustee, to each holder of the Floating Rate SSNs at such holder’s registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection and Notice”, stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Floating Rate SSNs on the date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Floating Rate SSN Indenture and described in such notice. The Floating Rate SSN Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations, including administrative interpretations thereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, no-action letters issued by the Commission indicating that the staff of the Commission will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions), to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Floating Rate SSNs as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Floating Rate SSN Indenture, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer will comply with any applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Floating Rate SSN Indenture by virtue of such compliance. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Floating Rate SSNs or portions (equal to €100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of Floating Rate SSNs properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Floating Rate SSN Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Floating Rate SSNs or portions of Floating Rate SSNs properly tendered; and 270 ----- (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Floating Rate SSN Trustee the Floating Rate SSNs properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate SSNs or portions of Floating Rate SSNs being purchased by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer. The Floating Rate SSN Principal Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Floating Rate SSNs properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Floating Rate SSNs, and the Floating Rate SSN Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will promptly, upon receipt of an authentication order from the Floating Rate SSN Issuer, authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Floating Rate SSN equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Floating Rate SSNs surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Floating Rate SSN will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Floating Rate SSN Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. The provisions described above that require the Floating Rate SSN Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Floating Rate SSN Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Floating Rate SSN Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Floating Rate SSNs to require that the Floating Rate SSN Issuer repurchase or redeem the Floating Rate SSNs in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a holder of the Floating Rate SSNs’ right to require the Floating Rate SSN Issuer to repurchase such holder’s Floating Rate SSNs upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. The Floating Rate SSN Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Floating Rate SSN Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer and purchases all Floating Rate SSNs properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Floating Rate SSN Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. In addition, the definitions of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. The Floating Rate SSN Issuer’s ability to repurchase Floating Rate SSNs pursuant to a Change of Control Offer following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Floating Rate SSNs. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness _and the Notes—We may not be able to finance a change of control offer and certain transactions will not require us to make a change of control offer”._ The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Floating Rate SSNs to require the Floating Rate SSN Issuer to repurchase its Floating Rate SSNs as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. The provisions under the Floating Rate SSN Indenture relating to the Floating Rate SSN Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Floating Rate SSNs as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Floating Rate SSNs prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control. 271 ----- If and for so long as the Floating Rate SSNs are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted for trading on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise use the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Floating Rate SSN Indenture.

If such redemption or purchase is so subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall describe each such condition, and if applicable, shall state that, in the Floating Rate SSN Issuer’s discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time (but not more than 60 days after the date the notice of redemption was sent) as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or such redemption or purchase may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date as so delayed. In addition, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. If any Floating Rate SSN is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Floating Rate SSN will state the portion of the principal amount of that Floating Rate SSN that is to be redeemed. A new Floating Rate SSN in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the original Floating Rate SSN will be issued in the name of the holder of Floating Rate SSNs upon cancellation of the original Floating Rate SSN. In the case of a Global Note, redemption will be effected in accordance with the procedures of the relevant clearing system or by making an appropriate notation on such Floating Rate SSN to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof. Floating Rate SSNs called for redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Floating Rate SSNs or portions of Floating Rate SSNs called for redemption. For Floating Rate SSNs which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream, for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing. So long as any Floating Rate SSNs are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted for trading on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, any such notice to the holders of the relevant Floating Rate SSNs shall, to the extent and in the manner permitted by such rules, be posted on the official website of the Exchange and, in connection with any redemption, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer will notify the Exchange of any change in the principal amount of Floating Rate SSNs outstanding. 274 ----- If requested in writing by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer, which request may be included in the applicable notice of redemption or pursuant to the applicable Officer’s Certificate, the Floating Rate SSN Trustee or the Floating Rate SSN Paying Agent (or such other entity directed, designated or appointed (as agent) by the Floating Rate SSN Trustee, for this purpose) shall distribute any amounts deposited to the holders prior to the applicable redemption date; provided, however, that holders shall have received at least three Business Days’ notice from the Floating Rate SSN Issuer of such earlier repayment (which may be included in the notice of redemption). For the avoidance of doubt, the distribution and payment to holders prior to the applicable redemption date as set forth above will not include any negative interest, present value adjustment, break costs or any other premium on such amounts. To the extent the Floating Rate SSNs are represented by a Global Note, any payment to the beneficial holders holding Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the then applicable procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream. For the avoidance of doubt, the Floating Rate SSN Trustee and the Floating Rate SSN Paying Agent shall not be liable to any party for any reason as a result of such amounts being distributed to holders prior to any applicable redemption date.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred _Stock” covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of_ Indebtedness described in this covenant, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its Incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such Incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, and from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant, provided that (a) Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Incurred or outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been Incurred on such date pursuant to clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt and may not be reclassified and (b) all Senior Secured Indebtedness Incurred under clause (1) of the second paragraph of this covenant that is secured by Liens on the Collateral that is accorded super senior priority with respect to proceeds of enforcement of the Collateral under the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may not be reclassified. The accrual of interest or Preferred Stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of Preferred Stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-euro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to euro, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the euro-equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the euro-equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally Incurred, except that to the extent that: (1) such euro-equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and 278 ----- (2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the euro-equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being Incurred or on the date as determined under “—Financial _Calculations”, as applicable._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values. For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS; (2) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; (3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be the lesser of: (i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and (ii) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person; (4) (i) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be double-counted and (ii) any guarantee by the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Indebtedness Incurred by a Parent Entity, where the net cash proceeds of such Parent Entity Indebtedness are on-lent to the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary as a Parent Debt Proceeds Loan and such Parent Debt Proceeds Loan is otherwise included in the determination of a permitted amount of Indebtedness, shall not be doublecounted; (5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (4) or (18) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be double-counted; (6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (7) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing or on the date as determined under “—Financial Calculations”, as applicable, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (8) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof; (9) in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance any other Indebtedness, any Indebtedness Incurred to fund any accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premia and other costs and expenses (including original issue 279 ----- discount, upfront fees or similar fees or any required additional tax gross-up amounts) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing shall not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred; and (10) in the event that the Floating Rate SSN Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (26) of the definition of “Permitted Liens”, the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Floating Rate SSN Indenture, including without limitation for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (22) of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any) for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Floating Rate SSN Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Floating Rate SSN Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of whether such ratio, test or other provision of the Floating Rate SSN Indenture is satisfied at the time of such borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, or the Consolidated Net Leverage, as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (22) of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Floating Rate SSN Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Holders of Floating Rate SSNs may not enforce the Floating Rate SSN Security Documents, except as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Floating Rate SSN Indenture will provide that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which the Floating Rate SSN Trustee has written notice, the Floating Rate SSN Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Floating Rate SSN Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Floating Rate SSN Indenture or that the Floating Rate SSN Trustee determines is materially prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Floating Rate SSN Trustee in personal liability. The Floating Rate SSN Issuer is required to deliver to the Floating Rate SSN Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Floating Rate SSN Indenture within 120 days after the end of each financial year. The Floating Rate SSN Trustee and the Security Agent may assume without inquiry, in the absence of actual 304 ----- knowledge, that the Floating Rate SSN Issuer is duly complying with its obligations contained in the Floating Rate SSN Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Floating Rate SSNs has occurred.

If the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Note Guarantor, as the case may be, becomes aware that it will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts with respect to any payment under or with respect to the Senior Notes or any Note Guarantee, the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor, as the case may be, will deliver to the Senior Notes Trustee and the Senior Notes Paying Agent on a date that is at least 30 days prior to the date of that payment (unless the obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to that payment date, in which case the Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor shall notify the Senior Notes Trustee and the Senior Notes Paying Agent promptly thereafter) an Officer’s Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount estimated to be so payable. The Officer’s Certificate must also set forth any other information reasonably necessary to enable the Senior Notes Paying Agents to pay Additional Amounts to holders on the relevant payment date. The Senior Notes Trustee and the Senior Notes Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as conclusive proof that such payments are necessary. The Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor will make all withholdings and deductions required by law and will timely remit the full amount deducted or withheld to the relevant Tax authority in accordance with applicable law. The Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor will use its reasonable efforts to obtain Tax receipts from each Tax authority evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld. The Senior Notes Issuer or the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor will furnish to the Senior Notes Trustee (or to a holder upon written request), within a reasonable time after the date the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is made, certified copies of Tax receipts evidencing payment by the Senior Notes Issuer or a Senior Notes Guarantor, as the case may be, or if, notwithstanding such entity’s efforts to obtain receipts, receipts are not obtained, other evidence of payments (reasonably satisfactory to the Senior Notes Trustee) by such entity. If reasonably requested by the Senior Notes Trustee, the Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Guarantors will provide to the Senior Notes Trustee such information as may be in the possession of the Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Guarantors (and not otherwise in the possession of the Senior Notes Trustee) to enable the Senior Notes Trustee to determine the amount of withholding taxes attributable to any particular holder, provided, however, that in no event shall the Senior Notes Issuer or the Senior Notes Guarantors be required to disclose any information that they reasonably deem to be confidential.

The Note Guarantees will be joint and several obligations of the Senior Notes Guarantors. Each Note Guarantee will be a general subordinated obligation of the relevant Senior Notes Guarantor, subordinated to the prior payment in full of all its respective obligations under its Senior Debt, including under the Revolving Credit Facility, the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs, the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture, the Floating Rate SSN Indenture and any future Senior Debt. See “—Subordination of the Note Guarantees”. Assuming we had completed the Transactions and applied the net proceeds as intended, as of March 31, 2021, the Senior Notes Issuer and the Senior Notes Guarantors would have had pro forma total debt, which reflects external interest-bearing loans and borrowings (and excludes leases, bank guarantees and trade payables, social charges, employee profit-sharing, taxes and other similar payables), of €1,710 million, €1,400 million of which would have been represented by guarantees of Fixed Rate SSNs and the Floating Rate SSNs, taken together, which guarantees and Floating Rate SSNs would be Senior Debt. As discussed in detail below under the caption “—Subordination of the _Note Guarantees,” payments under the Note Guarantees will be subordinated to the payment of Senior Debt._ The operations of the Senior Notes Issuer are conducted through its Subsidiaries, and therefore the Senior Notes Issuer depends on the cash flow of its Subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including its obligations under the Senior Notes. Not all of the Senior Notes Issuer’s Subsidiaries will guarantee the Senior Notes. The Senior Notes will be effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Indebtedness and other liabilities and commitments (including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Senior Notes Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries. Any right of the Senior Notes Issuer or any Senior Notes Guarantor to receive assets of any of its non-guarantor Subsidiaries upon that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the consequent right of the holders of the Senior Notes to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of that non-guarantor Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes Guarantor is itself recognized as a creditor of the non-guarantor Subsidiary, in which case the claims of the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes Guarantor, as the case may be, would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets of the non-guarantor Subsidiary and any Indebtedness of the non-guarantor Subsidiary senior to that held by the Senior Notes Issuer or such Senior Notes Guarantor. As of March 31, 2021, on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Transactions, including this offering of Senior Notes and the application of proceeds therefrom, the Senior Notes Issuer’s non-guarantor Subsidiaries would have had € million of Indebtedness (representing the Fixed Rate SSNs), excluding leases, bank guarantees and trade payables, social charges, employee profit-sharing, taxes and other similar payables.

In such a case, the relevant representative of such Senior Debt would be able to require that amounts which would otherwise have been paid to the Senior Notes Trustee or the holders of the Senior Notes be paid instead to such representative of or the lenders under such Senior Debt. Because of the foregoing subordination provisions, holders of the Senior Debt of a Senior Notes Guarantor that provides a Note Guarantee may recover disproportionately more than the holders of the Senior Notes recover in a bankruptcy or similar proceeding relating to such Senior Notes Guarantor. In such a case, there may be insufficient assets, or no assets, remaining at such Senior Notes Guarantor to pay the principal of or interest on the Senior Notes.

If any Collateral is granted to the Security Agent on its own behalf in its capacity as creditor of the parallel debt created under the Intercreditor Agreement in relation to the Senior Notes, then the rights of the Senior Notes Trustee and the holders of the Senior Notes will not be directly secured by the Collateral under such Senior Notes Security Documents, but through the parallel debt claim acknowledged by the Senior Notes Issuer by way of an independent acknowledgement of Indebtedness to the Security Agent that is equal to the total amounts payable by the Senior Notes Issuer under the Senior Notes Indenture and the Senior Notes.

The Senior Notes Issuer will not give any such notice of redemption earlier than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Senior Notes Issuer would be obligated to make such payment or withholding if a payment in respect of the Senior Notes were then due, and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts must be in effect at the time such notice is given. Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption of the Senior Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Senior Notes Issuer will deliver to the Senior Notes Trustee an opinion of independent tax counsel (the choice of such counsel to be subject to the prior written approval of the Senior Notes Trustee (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld)) to the effect that there has been such Change in Tax Law which would entitle the Senior Notes Issuer to redeem the Senior Notes hereunder.

Unless the Senior Notes Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Senior Notes as described under “—Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, within 60 days following any Change of Control, the Senior Notes Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of _Control Offer”), copied to the Senior Notes Trustee, to each holder of the Senior Notes at such holder’s_ registered address or otherwise deliver a notice in accordance with the procedures described under “—Selection _and Notice,” stating that a Change of Control Offer is being made and offering to repurchase Senior Notes on the_ date (the “Change of Control Payment Date”) specified in the notice, which date will be no earlier than 10 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed or delivered, pursuant to the procedures required by the Senior Notes Indenture and described in such notice. The Senior Notes Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under the U.S. Exchange Act and any other applicable securities laws and regulations, including administrative interpretations thereof (including, for the avoidance of doubt, noaction letters issued by the Commission indicating that the staff of the Commission will not recommend enforcement action in the event a tender offer satisfies certain conditions), to the extent those laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the repurchase of the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the Change of Control provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture, the Senior Notes Issuer will comply with any applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations under the Senior Notes Indenture by virtue of such compliance. On the Change of Control Payment Date, the Senior Notes Issuer will, to the extent lawful: (1) accept for payment all Senior Notes or portions (equal to €100,000 aggregate principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof) of Senior Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer; (2) deposit with the Senior Notes Principal Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all Senior Notes or portions of Senior Notes properly tendered; and (3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Senior Notes Trustee the Senior Notes properly accepted together with an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes or portions of Senior Notes being purchased by the Senior Notes Issuer. The Senior Notes Principal Paying Agent will promptly mail (or cause to be delivered) to each holder of Senior Notes properly tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Senior Notes, and the Senior Notes Trustee (or its authenticating agent) will promptly, upon receipt of an authentication order from the Senior Notes Issuer, authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book-entry) to each holder a new Senior Note equal in principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Senior Notes surrendered, if any; provided that each such new Senior Note will be in an aggregate principal amount that is at least €100,000 and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Senior Notes Issuer will publicly announce the results of the Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control Payment Date. The provisions described above that require the Senior Notes Issuer to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control will be applicable whether or not any other provisions of the Senior Notes Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Senior Notes Indenture will not contain provisions that permit the holders of the Senior Notes to require that the Senior Notes Issuer repurchase or redeem the Senior Notes in the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a holder of the Senior Notes’ right to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase such holder’s Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party from seeking to acquire the Senior Notes Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control. 358 ----- The Senior Notes Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer upon a Change of Control if (1) a third party makes the Change of Control Offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements set forth in the Senior Notes Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Senior Notes Issuer and purchases all Senior Notes properly tendered and not withdrawn under the Change of Control Offer, or (2) a notice of redemption has been given pursuant to the Senior Notes Indenture as described above under the caption “—Optional Redemption,” unless and until there is a default in payment of the applicable redemption price. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, a Change of Control Offer may be made in advance of a Change of Control, conditioned upon the consummation of such Change of Control, if a definitive agreement is in place for the Change of Control at the time the Change of Control Offer is made. In addition, the definitions of “Change of Control” and “Permitted Holders” expressly permit a third party to obtain control of the Senior Notes Issuer in a transaction which is a Specified Change of Control Event without any obligation to make a Change of Control Offer. The Senior Notes Issuer’s ability to repurchase Senior Notes pursuant to a Change of Control Offer following the occurrence of a Change of Control may be limited by the Senior Notes Issuer’s then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when necessary to make the required purchase of the Senior Notes. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and the Notes—We _may not be able to finance a change of control offer and certain transactions will not require us to make a change of control offer”._ The definition of Change of Control includes a phrase relating to the direct or indirect sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of “all or substantially all” of the properties or assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole. Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, the ability of a holder of Senior Notes to require the Senior Notes Issuer to repurchase its Senior Notes as a result of a sale, lease, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of less than all of the assets of the Senior Notes Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to another Person or group may be uncertain. The provisions under the Senior Notes Indenture relating to the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the Senior Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the consent of the holders of a majority in principal amount of the Senior Notes prior to the occurrence of the Change of Control. If and for so long as the Senior Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted for trading on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the Senior Notes Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Within 390 days after the receipt of any Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale, the Senior Notes Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be) may: (1) apply such Net Proceeds (at the option of the Senior Notes Issuer or Restricted Subsidiary): (a) (i) to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Senior Debt; or (ii) unless included in (a)(i), to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem Senior Notes and Pari Passu Debt (including by way of an Asset Sale Offer); provided that, in the case of (a)(ii), if the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall so reduce Obligations constituting Pari Passu Debt other than the Senior Notes, such prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption shall be at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such Pari Passu Debt plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts to the date of prepayment, repayment, purchase or redemption and the Senior Notes Issuer will at least equally and ratably reduce Obligations under the Senior Notes through openmarket purchases or by making an offer to all holders to purchase at a purchase price equal to at least 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any, for at least the pro rata amount of the Senior Notes; provided further, that in each case under this clause (a), such Senior Notes and Pari Passu Debt shall be other than Indebtedness owed to the Senior Notes Issuer or an Affiliate of the Senior Notes Issuer; (b) to purchase or prepay or redeem or repay (i) any Indebtedness that is secured by a Lien on assets or property which do not constitute Collateral or (ii) any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Senior Notes Guarantor; (c) to acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, or any Capital Stock of, another Permitted Business, if, after giving effect to any such acquisition of Capital Stock, the Permitted Business is or becomes a Restricted Subsidiary; (d) to make a capital expenditure; (e) to acquire other assets (other than Capital Stock) not classified as current assets under IFRS that are used or useful in a Permitted Business; or (f) any combination of the foregoing; or (2) enter into a binding commitment to apply the Net Proceeds pursuant to clause (a), (c), (d) or (e) of paragraph (1) above; provided that such binding commitment shall be treated as a permitted application of the Net Proceeds from the date of such commitment until the earlier of (x) the date on which such acquisition or expenditure is consummated, and (y) the 180[th] day following the expiration of the aforementioned 390-day period. If Net Proceeds from an Asset Sale are applied to prepay, repay, purchase or redeem any Indebtedness pursuant to the preceding paragraph, the Senior Notes Issuer shall be required to retire such Indebtedness or cause the related commitments to be permanently reduced, except in the case of revolving Indebtedness. 360 ----- Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Senior Notes Issuer (or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary) may temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise use the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture. Any Net Proceeds from Asset Sales that are not applied or invested as provided in the second paragraph of this covenant will constitute “Excess Proceeds”. When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds the greater of €20.0 million and 6% of Consolidated EBITDA, within ten Business Days thereof, the Senior Notes Issuer will make an offer (an “Asset Sale Offer”) to all holders of Senior Notes, copied to the Senior Notes Trustee, and, to the extent the Senior Notes Issuer elects, to all holders of other Indebtedness that is pari passu with the Senior Notes or any Note Guarantee, to purchase, prepay or redeem the maximum principal amount of Senior Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness (plus all accrued interest on the Indebtedness and the amount of all fees and expenses, including premiums and additional amounts, incurred in connection therewith) that may be purchased, prepaid or redeemed out of the Excess Proceeds. The offer price for the Senior Notes in any Asset Sale Offer will be equal to at least 100% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Amounts, if any, to the date of purchase, prepayment or redemption, subject to the rights of holders of Senior Notes on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date, and will be payable in cash. If any Excess Proceeds remain after consummation of an Asset Sale Offer, the Senior Notes Issuer may use those Excess Proceeds for any purpose not otherwise prohibited by the Senior Notes Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes and other pari passu Indebtedness tendered into (or to be prepaid or redeemed in connection with) such Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of Excess Proceeds or if the aggregate amount of Senior Notes tendered pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer exceeds the amount of the Net Proceeds so applied, the Senior Notes Trustee or Senior Notes Registrar will select the Senior Notes and such other pari passu Indebtedness, if applicable, to be purchased on a pro rata basis (or in the manner described under “—Selection and Notice”), based on the amounts tendered or required to be prepaid or redeemed. Upon completion of each Asset Sale Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset at zero. Neither the Senior Notes Trustee nor the Senior Notes Registrar shall be liable for any selection made in accordance with this paragraph. The Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, may make an Asset Sale Offer prior to the expiration of the 390-day period mentioned above.

In addition, the Senior Notes Issuer may provide in such notice that payment of the redemption price and performance of the Senior Notes Issuer’s obligations with respect to such redemption may be performed by another Person. If any Senior Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Senior Note will state the portion of the principal amount of that Senior Note that is to be redeemed.

On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to accrue on Senior Notes or portions of Senior Notes called for redemption. For Senior Notes which are represented by global certificates held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, notices may be given by delivery of the relevant notices to Euroclear or Clearstream for communication to entitled account holders in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

For purposes of determining compliance with this “Incurrence of Indebtedness and Issuance of Preferred _Stock” covenant, in the event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of_ Indebtedness described in this covenant, the Senior Notes Issuer, in its sole discretion, will be permitted to classify such item of Indebtedness on the date of its Incurrence and only be required to include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of such clauses and will be permitted on the date of such Incurrence to divide and classify an item of Indebtedness in more than one of the types of Indebtedness described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, and from time to time to reclassify all or a portion of such item of Indebtedness, in any manner that complies with this covenant, provided that Indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Facility Incurred or outstanding on the Issue Date will be deemed to have been Incurred on such date pursuant to clause (1) of the definition of Permitted Debt and may not be reclassified. The accrual of interest or Preferred Stock dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue discount, the payment of interest on any Indebtedness in the form of additional Indebtedness, the reclassification of 365 ----- Preferred Stock as Indebtedness due to a change in accounting principles, and the payment of dividends on Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock in the form of additional shares of the same class of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness or an issuance of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock for purposes of this covenant. For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of Indebtedness, the euro-equivalent principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in a different currency shall be utilized, calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred, in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit facility; provided, however, that (i) if such Indebtedness denominated in non-euro currency is subject to a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement with respect to euro, the amount of such Indebtedness expressed in euro will be calculated so as to take account of the effects of such Currency Exchange Protection Agreement; and (ii) the euro-equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date. The principal amount of any refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in the same currency as the Indebtedness being refinanced will be the euro-equivalent of the Indebtedness refinanced determined on the date such Indebtedness was originally Incurred, except that to the extent that: (1) such euro-equivalent was determined based on a Currency Exchange Protection Agreement, in which case the Refinancing Indebtedness will be determined in accordance with the preceding sentence; and (2) the principal amount of the refinancing Indebtedness exceeds the principal amount of the Indebtedness being refinanced, in which case the euro-equivalent of such excess will be determined on the date such refinancing Indebtedness is being Incurred or on the date as determined under “—Financial _Calculations,” as applicable._ Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the Senior Notes Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in exchange rates or currency values. For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding amount of any particular Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant: (1) in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined in accordance with IFRS; (2) the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be the principal amount of the Indebtedness, in the case of any other Indebtedness; (3) in respect of Indebtedness of another Person secured by a Lien on the assets of the specified Person, the amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date will be the lesser of: (i) the Fair Market Value of such assets at the date of determination; and (ii) the amount of the Indebtedness of the other Person; (4) guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be double-counted; (5) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1), (4) or (18) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such other Indebtedness shall not be double-counted; (6) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase premium) or the liquidation preference thereof; (7) notwithstanding anything in this covenant to the contrary, in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance Indebtedness initially Incurred in reliance on a clause of the second paragraph of this covenant measured by reference to a percentage of Consolidated EBITDA, if such refinancing would cause the percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction to be exceeded if calculated based on the 366 ----- percentage of Consolidated EBITDA on the date of such refinancing or on the date as determined under “—Financial Calculations,” as applicable, such percentage of Consolidated EBITDA restriction shall not be deemed to be exceeded so long as the principal amount of such refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (8) for purposes of determining compliance with this covenant, with respect to Indebtedness Incurred under a Credit Facility, reborrowings of amounts previously repaid pursuant to “cash sweep” or “clean down” provisions or any similar provisions under a Credit Facility that provide that Indebtedness is deemed to be repaid periodically shall only be deemed for purposes of this covenant to have been Incurred on the date such Indebtedness was first Incurred and not on the date of any subsequent reborrowing thereof; (9) in the case of any Indebtedness Incurred to refinance any other Indebtedness, any Indebtedness Incurred to fund any accrued and unpaid interest and any fees and expenses, including any defeasance costs, indemnity fees, discounts, premia and other costs and expenses (including original issue discount, upfront fees or similar fees or any required additional tax gross-up amounts) Incurred or payable in connection with such refinancing shall not be deemed to be Indebtedness for the purpose of calculating any basket, permission or threshold under which such refinancing Indebtedness is permitted to be Incurred; and (10) in the event that the Senior Notes Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary enters into or increases commitments under a revolving credit facility, enters into any commitment to Incur or issue Indebtedness or commits to Incur any Lien pursuant to clause (26) of the definition of “Permitted Liens,” the Incurrence or issuance thereof for all purposes under the Senior Notes Indenture, including without limitation for purposes of calculating the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, or usage of clauses (1) through (22) of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any) for borrowings and reborrowings thereunder (and including issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will, at the Senior Notes Issuer’s option, either (a) be determined on the date of such revolving credit facility or such entry into or increase in commitments (assuming that the full amount thereof has been borrowed as of such date) or other Indebtedness, and, if such Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio or Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as applicable, test or other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture is satisfied with respect thereto at such time, any borrowing or re-borrowing thereunder (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances thereunder) will be permitted under this covenant irrespective of whether such ratio, test or other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture is satisfied at the time of such borrowing or reborrowing (or issuance or creation of letters of credit or bankers’ acceptances thereunder) (the committed amount permitted to be borrowed or reborrowed (and the issuance and creation of letters of credit and bankers’ acceptances) on a date pursuant to the operation of this clause (a) shall be the “Reserved Indebtedness Amount” as of such date for purposes of the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio, the Consolidated Net Senior Secured Leverage Ratio, or the Consolidated Net Leverage, as applicable, and, to the extent of the usage of clauses (1) through (22) of the second paragraph of this covenant (if any), shall be deemed to be Incurred and outstanding under such clauses) or (b) be determined on the date such amount is borrowed pursuant to any such facility or increased commitment, and in each case, the Senior Notes Issuer may revoke such determination at any time and from time to time.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

For the avoidance of doubt, it will not constitute an Event of Default if the Senior Notes Issuer fails to satisfy the Sustainability Performance Targets by December 31, 2023, or fails to provide reports with respect to its performance against the Sustainability Performance Targets, and the sole recourse of holders of the Senior Notes in such instance shall be the right to receive the applicable increase in interest rate, in the manner described under the heading “—Principal, Maturity and Interest” and the associated change to the optional redemption prices under the heading “—Optional Redemption.” Subject to certain limitations, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes may direct the Senior Notes Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Senior Notes Trustee may withhold from holders of the Senior Notes notice of any continuing Default or Event of Default if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest, except a Default or Event of Default relating to the payment of principal, interest or Additional Amounts or premium, if any.

Except (subject to the provisions described under “—Amendment, Supplement and Waiver”) to enforce the right to receive payment of principal, premium, if any, or interest or Additional Amounts when due, no holder of a Senior Note may pursue any remedy with respect to the Senior Notes Indenture or the Senior Notes unless: (1) such holder has previously given the Senior Notes Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing; (2) holders of at least 30% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes have requested the Senior Notes Trustee to pursue the remedy; (3) such holders have offered the Senior Notes Trustee security and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding) satisfactory to the Senior Notes Trustee in its sole discretion against any loss, liability or expense; (4) the Senior Notes Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security and/or indemnity (including by way of prefunding); and (5) holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding Senior Notes have not given the Senior Notes Trustee a direction inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period.

Holders of Senior Notes may not enforce the Senior Notes Security Documents, except as provided in the Intercreditor Agreement. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing of which the Senior Notes Trustee has written notice, the Senior Notes Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Senior Notes Trustee, however, may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Senior Notes Indenture or that the Senior Notes Trustee determines is materially prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Senior Notes Trustee in personal liability. The Senior Notes Issuer is required to deliver to the Senior Notes Trustee annually a statement regarding compliance with the Senior Notes Indenture within 120 days after the end of each financial year. The Senior 386 ----- Notes Trustee and the Security Agent may assume without inquiry, in the absence of actual knowledge, that the Senior Notes Issuer is duly complying with its obligations contained in the Senior Notes Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Senior Notes has occurred. The Senior Notes Indenture will provide that (i) if a Default (a “Subsequent Default”) occurs solely as a result of an action taken while a Default (an “Initial Default”) for a failure to deliver a required certificate (unrelated to the action in respect of the Subsequent Default) is pending and the Initial Default is cured, such Subsequent Default will also be cured without any further action and (ii) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods prescribed in the covenant entitled “—Reports” or otherwise to deliver any notice or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Senior Notes Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not within the prescribed period specified in the Senior Notes Indenture.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly. Because Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear and/or Clearstream system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definitive certificate for that interest. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form.

The 75% withholding tax is applicable irrespective of the tax residency of the holder of the Fixed Rate SSNs. The list of Non-Cooperative States is published by a ministerial executive order, which is updated every year. Furthermore, according to Article 238 A of the FTC, interest and other revenues on debt will not be deductible from the debtor’s taxable income if they are paid or accrued to persons domiciled or established in a Non-Cooperative State or paid into a bank account opened with a financial institution located in such a Non-Cooperative State (the “Deductibility Exclusion”). Under certain conditions, any such non-deductible interest may be re-characterized as constructive dividends pursuant to Articles 109 et seq. of the FTC, in which case such non-deductible interest and other revenues may be subject to the withholding tax set out under Article 119 bis 2 of the FTC, at a rate of 12.8% for natural persons or at the standard rate of French corporate income tax for other persons, or at a rate of 75% (subject to more favorable provisions of any applicable double tax treaty).

Further, a Luxembourg resident individual who acts in the course of the management of his/her private wealth and who is the beneficial owner of an interest payment or other similar income made by a paying agent established outside Luxembourg in a Member State of the European Union or of the European Economic Area may also, in accordance with the 2005 Law, opt to self-declare and pay a final 20% levy (the “20% Levy”). In such case, the 20% Levy is calculated on the same amounts as for the payments made by Luxembourg resident paying agents. The option for the 20% Levy must cover all interest payments made by the paying agent to the Luxembourg resident beneficial owner during the entire civil year. 433 ----- _Non-resident Noteholders_ Under the Luxembourg tax law currently in effect, there is no withholding tax on payments of interest (including accrued but unpaid interest) made to a Luxembourg non-resident Noteholder, repayment of the principal, or redemption or exchange of the Notes.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Although the issue is not free from doubt, the Issuers intend to take the position that the Notes will not be treated as “contingent payment debt instruments” under applicable Treasury regulations because either the possibility of such additional amounts being paid on the Notes is remote or incidental or it is significantly more likely than not that such additional amounts will not be paid on the Notes. Therefore, the Issuers do not intend to treat the potential payment of additional interest or the potential payment of a premium pursuant to the optional redemption or change of control provisions as part of the yield to maturity of the Notes and do not intend to treat the Notes as contingent payment debt instruments. The Issuers’ determination is binding on a U.S. Holder, unless such U.S. Holder explicitly discloses to the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) on its tax return for the year during which it acquires the Notes that it is taking a different position. However, this determination is not binding on the IRS. If the IRS takes a contrary position to that described above, a U.S. Holder may be required to accrue interest income on the Notes based upon a comparable yield, regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting. The “comparable yield” is the yield at which the applicable Issuer would issue a fixed-rate debt instrument with no contingent payments, but with terms and conditions similar to those of the Notes. In addition, any gain on the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Notes would be recharacterized as ordinary income.

Stated interest paid by an Issuer on the Notes generally constitutes income from sources outside the United States. The amount 438 ----- of stated interest recognized by a cash basis U.S. Holder will be the U.S. dollar value of the interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note), based on the exchange rate in effect on the date of receipt, regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. A cash basis U.S. Holder generally will not realize exchange gain or loss on the interest payment but may realize exchange gain or loss when the holder disposes of any euro such U.S. Holder receives (as discussed below under “Exchange Gain or Loss with Respect to Foreign _Currency”)._ An accrual basis U.S. Holder may determine the amount of income recognized with respect to an interest payment denominated in euro in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, the amount of income accrued will be based on the average exchange rate in effect during the interest accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years of a U.S. Holder, the part of the period within the taxable year). Under the second method, the U.S. Holder may elect to determine the amount of income accrued on the basis of the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the accrual period (or, in the case of an accrual period that spans two taxable years, the exchange rate in effect on the last day of the part of the period within the taxable year). Additionally, if a payment of interest is actually received within five business days of the last day of the accrual period, an electing accrual basis U.S. Holder may instead translate the accrued interest into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the day of actual receipt. Any such election will apply to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder at the beginning of the first taxable year to which the election applies and thereafter acquired by the U.S. Holder and will be irrevocable without the consent of the IRS. Upon an accrual basis U.S. Holder’s receipt of an interest payment (including a payment attributable to accrued but unpaid interest upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of a Note) denominated in euro, the U.S. Holder may recognize exchange gain or loss (taxable as ordinary income or loss and generally U.S. source) equal to the difference between the amount received (translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the date of receipt) and the amount previously accrued (as determined in the manner described above), regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. In the event that Additional Amounts are paid in respect of withholding or deductions for taxes imposed on payments on the Notes (as described under “Description of the Fixed Rate Senior Secured Notes—Additional _Amounts”, “Description of the Floating Rate Senior Secured Notes—Additional Amounts” and “Description of the Senior Notes—Additional Amounts”), such Additional Amounts will be taxable to U.S. Holders as ordinary_ income at the time the amounts accrue or are received, in accordance with such holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The amount taxable to such holder will also include all taxes withheld or deducted in respect thereof. As a result, U.S. Holders may be required to report income in an amount greater than the cash they receive in respect of payments on the Notes. A U.S. Holder may be entitled to deduct or credit foreign taxes imposed on interest income (including Additional Amounts), subject to certain limitations (including that the election to deduct or credit foreign taxes applies to all of the U.S. Holder’s other applicable foreign taxes for a particular tax year). Interest income (including any Additional Amounts) on a Note generally will be considered foreign source income and, for purposes of the U.S. foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive category income. A U.S. Holder will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for foreign taxes imposed with respect to the Notes where the U.S. Holder does not meet a minimum holding period requirement during which the U.S. Holder is not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex and this paragraph discusses those rules only at a high level of generality.

In that case, U.S. Holders generally must include OID in gross income in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that income, regardless of their method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A Note with an “issue price” (as defined above) that is less than its stated principal amount generally will be issued with OID in an amount equal to that difference if such difference is at least 0.25% of the stated principal amount multiplied by the number of complete years to maturity. 439 ----- If a U.S. Holder owns a Note issued with OID, the U.S. Holder generally must include the OID in income (as ordinary income) in advance of the receipt of some or all of the related cash payments using the “constant yield method” described in the following paragraphs. The amount of OID that must be included in income by a U.S. Holder that owns a Note issued with OID is the sum of the “daily portions” of OID with respect to the Note for each day during the taxable year or portion of the taxable year in which the U.S. Holder held that Note (“accrued OID”). The daily portion is determined by allocating to each day in any “accrual period” a pro rata portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. The “accrual period” for a Note may be of any length and may vary in length over the term of the Note, provided that each accrual period is no longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on the first day or the final day of an accrual period. The amount of OID allocable to any accrual period other than the final accrual period is an amount equal to the excess, if any, of: - the Note’s “adjusted issue price” at the beginning of the accrual period multiplied by its yield to maturity, determined on the basis of compounding at the close of each accrual period and properly adjusted for the length of the accrual period, over - the aggregate of all stated interest allocable to the accrual period. OID allocable to a final accrual period is the difference between the amount payable at maturity, other than a payment of stated interest, and the adjusted issue price at the beginning of the final accrual period. Special rules will apply for calculating OID for an initial short accrual period. The “adjusted issue price” of a Note at the beginning of any accrual period is equal to its issue price increased by the accrued OID for each prior accrual period. Under these rules, a U.S. Holder will have to include in income increasingly greater amounts of OID in successive accrual periods. With regard to the Floating Rate SSNs solely for purposes of determining the amount and accrual of OID and stated interest, it is assumed that such notes bear interest at a fixed interest rate equal to the value, as of the Issue Date, of the floating rate. A U.S. Holder may elect to treat all interest on any Note as OID and calculate the amount includible in gross income under the constant yield method described above. For purposes of this election, interest includes stated interest, OID and de minimis OID. U.S. Holders should consult their own tax advisors about this election. OID will be determined for any accrual period in euro and then translated into U.S. dollars, in the same manner as interest income accrued by a holder on the accrual basis, as described above (regardless of the U.S. Holder’s method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes). U.S. Holders will recognize U.S. source ordinary gain or loss when OID is paid (including amounts received upon the sale of a Note attributable to OID previously included in income) to the extent of the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such payment (determined by translating the euro received at the spot rate on the date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the accrued OID (determined in the same manner as for accrued interest). For these purposes, all receipts on a Note will be viewed: - first, as the receipt of any stated interest payments called for under the terms of the Note, - second, as receipts of previously accrued OID (to the extent thereof), with payments considered made for the earliest accrual periods first, and - third, as the receipt of principal. The rules governing OID are complex.

A U.S. Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Note generally will be its U.S. dollar cost (as defined below) reduced by the amount of any principal paid on the Note and increased by any OID previously included in income. The U.S. dollar cost of a Note purchased with euro will be the U.S. dollar value of the euro paid for the Note determined at the spot rate on the date of purchase (or, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual method taxpayer, the settlement date of such purchase, if the Notes are traded on an established securities market for U.S. 440 ----- federal income tax purposes).

The election described in this paragraph must be applied consistently to all debt instruments held by the U.S. Holder from year to year and cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Except as described below, gain or loss on a disposition of a Note generally will be U.S. source capital gain or loss. Any capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if the U.S. Holder has held the Note for more than one year at the time of disposition. A non-corporate U.S. Holder generally will be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any long-term capital gain recognized. Deductions for capital losses are subject to limitations. A portion of a U.S. Holder’s gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a Note may be treated as exchange gain or loss. Such exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the Note is the U.S. Holder’s purchase price for the Note calculated in euro on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss is equal to the difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition of the Note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount on the date the U.S. Holder purchased the Note (or, possibly, in the case of a cash basis or electing accrual basis taxpayer, the settlement dates of such purchase and taxable disposition, if the Note is treated as traded on an established securities market for U.S. federal income tax purposes).

Under proposed Treasury Regulations, withholding on “foreign passthru payments” on Notes that are not otherwise grandfathered (as described below) would apply to “foreign passthru payments” made on or after the date that is two years after the date of publication in the U.S. Federal Register of applicable final regulations defining “foreign passthru payments.” Taxpayers may generally rely on these proposed regulations until final regulations are issued. Obligations issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which applicable final regulations defining foreign passthru payments are filed generally would be “grandfathered” unless materially modified after such date.

On the request of the SN Issuer and the Floating Rate SSN Issuer, each Noteholder shall agree to provide certain information, including, in the case of a passive Non-Financial Foreign Entity (“NFFE”), information on the controlling persons of such NFFE, along with the required supporting documentation. Similarly, each Noteholder shall agree to actively provide to the SN Issuer and the Floating Rate SSN Issuer within thirty (30) days any information that would affect its status, as for instance a new mailing address or a new residency address.

If the statutory auditor considers that decisions made by the shareholders during the shareholders’ meeting do not ensure the company’s existence as a going concern, he or she must inform the president of the relevant commercial court of the warning procedure and may also request to be heard by the said president on the matter. As regards companies that are not incorporated as sociétés anonymes, similar warning procedures exist even if the practical details differ slightly. Shareholders representing at least 5% of the share capital and the workers’ committee (or, in their absence, the employees’ representatives) have similar rights. The President of the Commercial Court can also himself summon the management to provide explanations on elements which the President of the court believes put the company’s existence as a going concern in jeopardy (or when the company has not filed its financial statements within the statutory timeframe, despite his injunction). 445 ----- Due to COVID-19 pandemic, ordinance 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, as amended by Law No. 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, has amended the warning procedure to provide that, until and including December 31, 2021, if the statutory auditor considers the state of the relevant company to require immediate action, and has determined that the director is refusing to take such action or is taking insufficiently measures, he/she may inform the president of the relevant commercial court concurrently with his or her initial report made to the director, the chairman of the board of directors (conseil d’administration) or of the supervisory board (conseil de _surveillance), as the case may be._ In such case, the statutory auditor may communicate by any means and without delay to the president of the court his or her findings and proceedings and may produce copies of any relevant documents. The statutory auditor is released from his or her obligation of professional secrecy towards the president of the relevant commercial court under these circumstances. This exceptional procedure does not preclude the application of the ordinary warning procedure detailed above.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The President of the competent court will appoint a trustee (as the case may be, a mandataire ad hoc or a _conciliateur) in order to help the debtor company reach an agreement with its main creditors and stakeholders, in_ particular by reducing or rescheduling its indebtedness. The debtor may propose, in the filing for the commencement of the proceedings, the appointment of a particular person as trustee. Such proceedings are non-binding since the court-appointed trustee has no power to force the parties to accept an agreement and the dissenting creditors will not be bound by the arrangement, if any. Creditors are not barred from taking legal action against the company to recover their claims, but, in practice, they generally abstain from doing so. _Mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used at the request of the debtor and after the_ opinion of the participating creditors has been sought to prepare the sale of all or part of the business of the debtor with a view to implement such sale (plan de cession) in a subsequent insolvency proceeding.

During the proceedings, creditors may continue to sue individually for payment of their claims but they usually in practice accept not to do so. In addition, the debtor retains the right to petition the president of the Commercial Court for a grace period under Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code. The judge having opened conciliation proceedings (i) may grant a grace period even when the formal notice asking the debtor to pay was sent before conciliation proceedings commenced (and not only during conciliation proceedings) and (ii) may grant a grace period during the implementation of the conciliation agreement (and not only during conciliation proceedings) (see below). If an agreement is reached among the parties in the context of conciliation proceedings, (i) any individual proceedings by creditors with respect to the claims included in the rescheduling agreement are suspended, (ii) accrued interest of the claims governed by the restructuring agreement cannot bear themselves interest (notwithstanding Article 1343-2 of the French Civil Code) and (iii) the debtor retains the right to petition the President of the Court who opened conciliation proceedings for a grace period (pursuant to Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code mentioned above) in relation to claims of non-consenting creditors (other than public creditors) who were called to the conciliation. Joint debtors, personal guarantors, or any third party that granted a security interest can benefit from the grace periods granted to the debtor during conciliation proceedings as well as from the provisions of the sanctioned or acknowledged agreement. The agreement may be either recognized (constaté) by the president of the court at all parties’ request or, at the request of the debtor (and provided that certain conditions are satisfied, i.e. that (i) the debtor is not in _cessation des paiements or the conciliation agreement puts an end to such cessation des paiements, (ii) the_ agreement does not infringe upon the rights of the non-signatory creditors and (iii) it effectively ensures that the company will survive as a going concern), sanctioned (homologué) by the court. In each case, the debtor must file its request by the end of the five-month period (10 months until December 31, 2021 pursuant to ordinance 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020, as amended by Law No. 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020), even though the hearing can take place afterwards, in which case the conciliation period will be extended until the decision of the president of the court or the court itself. While recognition (constatation) of the agreement by the president of the court does not entail any specific consequences, other than to render the agreement immediately enforceable and binding upon the parties thereto (in particular, performance of the conciliation agreement prevents any action by the creditors party thereto against the debtor to obtain payment of claims governed by the conciliation agreement), sanction (homologation) by the court has the following consequences: - the judgment will make the conciliation proceedings public (however, disclosure only of the existence of the conciliation proceedings and not of the content of the agreement except the Guarantees and privileges as well as the amount of “new money” detailed below, as provided for in the agreement and except vis-à-vis the social and economic committee or employee representatives that are informed of the content of the conciliation agreement and may have access to the full conciliation agreement at the clerk’s office (greffe) of the court); - when the debtor is submitted to statutory auditing, the conciliation agreement is communicated to its statutory auditors; - creditors who, as part of the sanctioned agreement or during the course of the conciliation proceedings, provide new money or goods or services designed to ensure the continuation of the business of the distressed company (other than shareholders providing new equity) will enjoy priority of payment over all pre-petition and post-petition claims (other than certain pre-petition employment claims and postpetition procedural costs), in the event of subsequent safeguard proceedings (including accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings); - in the event of subsequent safeguard, accelerated safeguard, accelerated financial safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, the payment date of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien may not be rescheduled and these claims may not be written off by the court (not even when creditor are consulted through creditors committees, it being noted that the authority of the bondholder general meeting in this respect is debated), each time without their holders’ consent; and - in the event of subsequent judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings, the date of the cessation des paiements (and therefore the starting date of the “hardening period” as defined 447 ----- below) cannot be determined by the court to be at a date earlier than the date of the sanction of the agreement by the court, except in case of fraud. In case of breach of the agreement, whether sanctioned or recognized, any party thereto can petition the court for its rescission. However, provided that the conciliation agreement’s terms are complied with, any individual proceeding by any creditor for the payment of claims covered by the conciliation agreement are suspended and/or prohibited. The commencement of subsequent insolvency proceedings will automatically put an end to the conciliation agreement, in which case the creditors will recover their claims and security interests, to the exception of those amounts already paid to them. In any event, the debtor retains the right to petition for a grace period pursuant to article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code. Conciliation proceedings, in the context of which a draft plan has been negotiated and is supported by a large majority of creditors without reaching unanimity, will be a mandatory preliminary step of the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings as described below. At the request of the debtor and after the creditors taking part in the proceedings have been consulted on the matter, mandat ad hoc and conciliation proceedings may also be used to organize the partial or total sale of the debtor, in particular through a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) that could be implemented in the context of subsequent safeguard, judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings. Provided that they comply with certain requirements, any offers received in this context by the mandataire ad hoc or the conciliateur may be directly considered by the court in the context of safeguard, judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings after consultation of the public prosecutor. As a matter of law, any contractual provision that (i) modifies the conditions for the continuation of an ongoing contract by reducing the debtors’ rights or increasing its obligations simply by reason of the designation of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings or of a request submitted to this end or (ii) requires the debtor to bear, by reason only of the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or of the commencement of conciliation proceedings, more than three-quarters of the fees of the professional advisers retained by creditors in connection with these proceedings, is deemed null and void. Where the maximum time period allotted to pre-insolvency proceedings expires without an agreement being reached, the proceedings will end. The termination of such proceedings does not in itself entail any specific legal consequences for the debtor, in particular it does not result in the automatic commencement of insolvency proceedings. New conciliation proceedings cannot be commenced before three months have elapsed as from the end of the previous ones. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance No. 2020-341 of March 27, 2020, Ordinance No. 2020-596 of May 20, 2020 and Ordinance No. 20201443 of November 25, 2020 and Law No. 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 have modified conciliation proceedings to provide that, until December 31, 2021: (a) the duration of conciliation proceedings can be extended upon request of the conciliator, thereby increasing the maximum duration of conciliation proceedings to ten months (instead of five months previously); (b) if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the said conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to defer payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation proceedings, the debtor may request from the President of the Commercial Court in ex-parte proceedings, for the duration of the conciliation proceedings: - the stay or prohibition of any legal action for payment or for termination of a contract for a payment default; - the stay or prohibition of any judicial enforcement measure against the debtor’s movable or immovable property as well as any judicial procedure relating to the distribution of the debtor’s assets that would not have already transferred ownership away from the debtor; or - the deferral or rescheduling of the creditor’s claim; (c) the debtor may petition the judge that commenced conciliation proceedings for a grace period in accordance with Article 1343-5 of the French Civil Code (see “—France—Grace periods” above) even 448 ----- before the creditor sends any notice to pay or initiates any suit for payment if a creditor does not accept, by the deadline set by the conciliator, a request made by the conciliator to suspend payment of his claim for the duration of the conciliation.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

During the observation period, a court-appointed administrator, whose name can be suggested by the debtor in safeguard proceedings, investigates the business of the company. In safeguard proceedings, the administrator’s mission is limited to either supervising the debtor’s management or primarily assisting it in preparing a safeguard plan for the company. In judicial reorganization proceedings, the administrator’s mission is usually to assist the management and to make proposals for the reorganization of the company, which proposals may include a reorganization plan (equivalent to a safeguard plan) and/or the sale of all or part of the company’s business to a third party. In judicial reorganization proceedings, the court may also decide that the court-appointed administrator will manage the company alone by replacing the debtor’s management. At the end of the observation period, if it concludes that the company can survive as a going concern, the court will adopt a safeguard or a reorganization plan, which will essentially provide for a restructuring and/or rescheduling of debts which may only entail the partial divesture of assets rather than the entire business, to a third party (a sale of the entire business is not possible in a safeguard plan). Unlike in safeguard proceedings, at the end of the observation period of judicial reorganization proceedings and, alternatively to a reorganization plan, the court may determine that all or part of the business should be sold to purchasers who have submitted bids. Judicial liquidation proceedings entail the relief of the debtor of the management and there is no observation period in such proceedings. The outcome of liquidation proceedings, which is decided by the court without a vote 449 ----- of the creditors, may be a sale of the business and/or isolated sales of the debtor’s assets in order to discharge the debtor’s liabilities. Where a sale of the business (partial or not) is contemplated, the court may authorize a temporary continuation of the business for a maximum period of three months (renewable once for a period of three months at the Public Prosecutor’s request) whose effects are similar to an observation period. If, after commencement of the proceedings, it appears that the debtor was insolvent (en état de cessation des _paiements) before their commencement, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the_ creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor but, in any event, after having heard the debtor, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings depending on the circumstances (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court may convert the safeguard proceedings into reorganization proceedings (i) upon its own initiative or at the request of either of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the public prosecutor, if the debtor enters into cessation des _paiements or (ii) at the debtor’s request, if the approval of the safeguard plan is manifestly impossible and if the_ company would become in cessation des paiements should safeguard proceedings be closed. In addition, where no safeguard plan has been adopted by the creditors’ committees (pursuant to article L.626-30-2 and L.626-32 of the French Commercial Code, as the case may be), the Court may also convert the proceedings into a judicial reorganization upon request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative or the Public Prosecutor if the approval of the safeguard plan is obviously impossible and if the company would become in cessation des paiements should safeguard proceedings be closed. At any time during the observation period, the court can order the liquidation of the company if the debtor is in cessation des paiements and its rescue has become manifestly impossible. However, it cannot be ruled out that further both decisions from the French Constitutional Court dated December 7, 2012 (n°2012-286 QPC) and March 7, 2014 (n°2012-368 QPC) the constitutionality of the conversion of a safeguard into judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings, when it is decided upon the court’s own initiative, can be challenged. The Court’s decision is only made after having heard the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative, creditors appointed as controller, the Public Prosecutor and the employees’ representatives (if any). As soon as safeguard proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. If the court adopts a safeguard plan, a reorganization plan or a plan for the sale of the business, it can set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and state of health emergency that was imposed by the French government, Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law No. 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020, modified safeguard and reorganization proceedings to provide that: - as an incentive for new financings granted to debtors in the context of safeguard or reorganization proceedings a new safeguard or reorganization privilege is created (the “S/R Lien”), applicable exclusively to proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021. The S/R Privilege is distinct from the existing statutory preference enjoyed by financing granted, with the approval of the insolvency judge (juge-commissaire), after commencement of the proceedings, for the needs of the proceedings or of the observation period. - The S/R Lien applies to all new cash contributions made, with the exception of those made through a share capital increase, by any person: - during the observation period, in order to ensure the continuity of debtor’s business and its sustainability, in which case such cash contributions must be authorized by the insolvency judge, or - for the implementation of the safeguard or reorganization plan, i.e., within the plan as approved or modified by the court, and for the purposes of its execution, it being specified that the judgment must mention all claims benefiting from the privilege, as well as the relevant amounts. 450 ----- - Claims benefiting from the S/R Lien enjoy a priority of payment over pre-commencement and postcommencement claims except with respect to employees’ super-privilege claims, procedural costs and the New Money Lien, pre-petition claims secured by a real estate security interest (in judicial liquidation proceedings only) and post-petition wages claims not advanced by the French wages guarantee fund, in the event of on-going or subsequent safeguard proceedings, judicial reorganization proceedings or judicial liquidation proceedings. - Such claims may not termed-out or written-off without the consent of the relevant creditors. Creditors’ committees and adoption of the safeguard or reorganization plan During the observation period, in the case of large companies (with more than 150 employees or turnover greater than €20 million, and the accounts of which have been certified by a statutory auditor or established by an accountant), or where authorized by the supervising judge for smaller companies, two creditors’ committees (one for credit institutions having a claim against the debtor or entities having granted credit or advances in favor of the debtor (or the assignee of such claim or of a claim acquired from a supplier) and the other for suppliers having a claim that represents more than 3% of the total amount of the claims of all the debtor’s suppliers—the smaller suppliers, if invited by the court-appointed administrator, may elect to be members of such committee) have to be established. To be eligible to vote, suppliers must have their claims set forth in the list provided by the debtor to the court-appointed administrator as certified by the debtor’s statutory auditors (or, in their absence, its accountant). If there are any outstanding debt securities in the form of “obligations” (such as bonds or notes), a general meeting gathering all holders of such debt securities will be established whether or not there are different issuances and no matter what the governing law of those “obligations” is (the “bondholders general meeting”). The Notes constitute “obligations” for purposes of a safeguard or judicial reorganization proceeding and the Noteholders would therefore vote within the bondholders general meeting. As a general matter, only the legal owner of the debt claim will be invited into a committee or the bondholders’ general meeting. Accordingly, a person holding only an economic interest therein will not itself be a member of the committees or bondholders general meeting. For proceedings opened as from July 1, 2014, not only is the debtor entitled to present a draft plan but also creditors from a creditors’ committee (credit institutions’ committee or suppliers’ committee). These creditors’ committees and the bondholders general meeting will be consulted on the safeguard or reorganization plans drafted by the debtor’s management together with the judicial administrators during the observation period but also by any creditor belonging to a creditors’ committee. For the avoidance of doubt, bondholders are not entitled to propose such a draft plan. Draft plans submitted to the committees and the bondholders: - must take into account subordination agreements entered into by the creditors before the opening of the proceedings; - may treat creditors differently if it is justified by their differences in situation; and - may notably include a rescheduling or cancellation of debts and debt-for-equity swaps (subject to the specific regime of claims benefiting from the New Money Lien or the S/R Lien), and/or debt-for-equity swaps (debt-for-equity swaps requiring the relevant shareholder consent). In the first instance, one of the plans must either be approved by each of the two creditors’ committees. Each committee must announce whether its members approve or reject such plan within 20 to 30 days of its proposal by the company (such time can be reduced or extended by the supervising judge, at the request of the debtor or the judicial administrator, it being noted that it cannot last less than 15 days). If there is no proposal by the debtor, the judicial administrator determines the date on which the committees will vote. Such approval requires the affirmative vote of the members of each committee holding at least two-thirds of the amount of the claims held by members of such committee that expressed a vote. Each member of a committee informs the court-appointed administrator of any agreement subjecting its vote to certain conditions or providing for the total or partial payment of its claim by a third party or any subordination agreement. The courtappointed administrator will submit to the creditor the conditions of calculation of its voting rights. In case of disagreement on this calculation, both the creditor and the court-appointed administrator may seize the president of the Court in summary proceedings. 451 ----- Following the approval of the plan by the two creditors’ committees (or the sole credit institutions’ committee in the case of accelerated financial safeguard proceedings), the plan will be submitted for approval to the bondholders general meeting. The approval of the plan at such meeting requires the affirmative vote of bondholders representing at least two-thirds of the amount of the obligations held by bondholders who expressed a vote in the bondholders general meeting. The same rules as set forth in the paragraph above apply to the bondholders general meeting. Where the plan provides for a share capital modification, or an amendment of the articles of association, the shareholders’ general meeting must approve this modification prior to the endorsement of the plan. The Court may decide, for the first convocation to such general meeting, a lowering of the thresholds for the quorum and majority needed to approve the modification (a resolution to modify the share capital can be passed at a meeting convened for that purpose by a simple majority of the votes present, provided that they represent at least half of all the shares with voting rights), with regular applicable thresholds for quorum and majority upon second convocation to the general meeting. If the plan provides for a share capital increase, shareholders can set off their claim, provided it has been admitted (admise) by the Court within the framework of the proceedings, and within the limit of the reduction included in the plan. In case of judicial reorganization only, if equity capital of the debtor is lower than half of the share capital and has not been restored, the court-appointed administrator can request the Court to appoint a judicial officer (mandataire de justice) to (i) convene the shareholders meeting and (ii) vote the share capital restoration in place of the opposing shareholders should the plan provide for a share capital modification to the benefit of one or several persons which made commitments to execute the plan. In case of judicial reorganization only, the Court may, upon request from the judicial administrator or the public prosecutor (and under certain procedural and substantial conditions), decide to squeeze out certain shareholders that have refused a modification of the share capital provided under a reorganization plan benefiting one or several persons who undertook to implement such plan, subject to the following cumulative conditions being met: - the proceedings concern a company with a minimum workforce of 150 employees or a dominant company (within the meaning of the French Labour Code) in a group with a minimum global workforce of 150 employees; - the cessation of such company’s activity may create a risk of serious trouble to the national or local economy and the employment area; and - a modification of the share capital being the only serious option enabling avoidance of such trouble and enabling the continuation of the business (after examination of the possibility of totally or partially selling the business). Such squeeze out can take two different forms: - a forced dilution of shareholders’ rights as part of a capital increase, by having an officer appointed by the court in order to convene the shareholders’ meeting and vote in lieu of the dissenting shareholders; or - a forced sale, for the benefit of the persons who undertook to implement the reorganization plan, of the shares of shareholders holding the majority voting rights or a blocking minority and who refused the modifications of share capital provided under the reorganization plan; failing any agreement on the value of the transferred shares, this value is to be set by an expert appointed by the president of the court. Creditors for whom the plan does not provide any modification of their repayment schedule or provides for a payment of their claims in cash in full as soon as the plan is adopted or as soon as their claims are admitted do not take part in the vote. For those same creditors who are outside such committees (or where no such committees have been convened), the creditors’ representative may elect not to consult them. In addition, the amounts of claims secured by a trust (fiducie) granted by the debtor do not give rise to voting rights. Following approval by the requisite creditors’ committees and the bondholders’ general meeting, the plan has to be approved (arrêté) by the relevant court. In considering such approval, the court has to verify that the interests of all creditors are sufficiently protected. Once approved by the relevant court, the safeguard or reorganization plan accepted by the committees and the bondholders’ general meeting will be binding on all the 452 ----- members of the committees and all bondholders (including those who did not vote or voted against the adoption of the plan), as well as those creditors outside such committees / general meeting (it being noted that they can only be imposed debt rescheduling by the court as detailed below). In the event any of the committees or the bondholders’ general meeting has refused to give its consent to the plan (or has not rendered its decision within six months of the opening judgment); (it being noted that this 6-month period may be extended by the court at the request of the judicial administrator to the extent it does not exceed the duration of the observation period), the plan will not be approved by the court which can still adopt a safeguard plan in the time remaining until the end of the observation period, in which case a consultation of the creditors on an individual basis will take place. They will be asked whether they accept rescheduling, cancellation of debt and/or debt-for-equity swaps provided for in the draft plan. Where the consultation is in writing, the creditor is deemed to have accepted the debt rescheduling and/or write-offs proposal if he fails to respond within thirty days upon receipt of the creditors’ representative letter. However, in respect to debt-to-equity swap proposals, the creditors’ representative must obtain the agreement of each individual creditor in writing within this 30-day timeframe. In those circumstances, the court has the right to accept or reduce debt deferrals or write-offs with respect to the claims of creditors who have consented to such measures, but it may only impose uniform debt deferrals (with interest for debts with an initial maturity of more than one year) for a maximum period of ten years with respect to the claims of non-consenting creditors except for claims with maturity dates of more than ten years, in which case the maturity date shall remain the same. The court cannot impose on them debt write-offs or debt-to-equity swaps. The same rule applies with respect to creditors who are not members of the committees, or where no such committees nor general meeting of bondholders are convened. Following a court-imposed rescheduling, the first payment under the plan must be made within a year of the judgment approving the plan (as from the third year included, the minimum annual instalment is 5% of each of the admitted liabilities), it being noted, however, that if the contractual provisions relating to a debt claim provide that the principal amount of such debt claim is repayable in fine and its maturity date falls within the implementation period of the plan, the repayment of such principal amount only starts on the annual instalment date (as set out in the plan) following the original contractual maturity date of that debt claim and such debt rescheduling follows specific rules. Specific case – Creditors that are public institutions: public creditors (financial administrations, social security and unemployment insurance organizations) may agree to grant debt remissions under conditions that are similar to those that would be granted under normal market conditions by a private economic operator placed in a similar position. Public creditors may also decide to enter into subordination agreements for liens or mortgages, or relinquish these security interests. Public creditors examine possible remissions within the framework of a local administrative committee (Commission des Chefs de Services Financiers). The tax administrations may grant relief from all direct taxes. As regards indirect taxes, relief may only be granted from default interest, adjustments, penalties or fines.

Until December 31, 2021 (included), on the basis of the certificate drawn up by a certified accountant or the statutory auditor, liabilities to be taken into account in the draft plan shall include those claims admitted and not challenged as well as those “identifiable” claims (in particular when the deadline for filing proofs of claim has not expired yet): This includes liabilities foreseeable and reasonably likely to enable the Court to assess the seriousness of the plan (which requires that the debtor’s accounts be accurate, and that identifiable claims be taken into account, such as those of the French wages guarantee fund); This implies a temporary exception to the principle (established in case law) according to which the plan must be drawn up in consideration of the filed claims (even if they are challenged); 2. Until December 31, 2021 (included), upon request of the judicial administrator (if appointed) or the creditors’ representative, the bankruptcy judge may shorten the deadline for individual consultation of the creditors from 30 to 15 days. 3. Until December 31, 2021 (included), proposals for the settlement of liabilities included in the plan and any responses to these proposals may be notified by any means allowing the creditor’s representative to establish 453 ----- with certainty the date of their receipt, both in the context of the individual consultation of creditors and the consultation of bondholders within the framework of the bondholder’s general meeting (it is unclear whether this method of notification also applies to the credit and credit institutions or assimilated institutions’ committee and main suppliers’ committee). 4. The duration of safeguard and reorganization plans has been amended as follows: (i) Until December 31, 2021 (included): in addition to (i): extension for a further two-year period upon request of the public prosecutor or the court-appointed trustee in charge of supervising the execution of the plan. (ii) Until December 31, 2021 (included): in case of substantial modification of the plan, its duration is extended to a maximum period of 12 years. With respect to (i) above, it should be specified that this extension does not require going through the process of substantial modification of the plan (modification substantielle du plan), as the payment instalment deadlines initially set are adapted by the president of the court or the whole court extending through the duration of the plan, with possible deviation from the obligation to pay an annual instalment of 5% minimum as from year 3 and possible application of grace periods provisions (see above “Grace Periods”) within the limit of the new term of the plan so extended. 5. Until December 31, 2021 (included), as part of a substantial modification of the plan process, where the modification is relating to the plan’s repayment terms and conditions, those creditors failing to reply to the registered letter provided for in Article R. 626-45 of the French commercial code will be deemed to have accepted the proposed modifications, except in case of debt write-offs or conversions into shares that give or may give access to share capital. Where creditors are consulted within the framework of creditors’ committees, the procedures for consultation of the committees continue to apply.

The accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings have been designed to “fast-track” the regular safeguard proceedings relating to large companies. The regime applicable to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is roughly the regime applicable to the regular safeguard proceeding to the extent compatible with the accelerated timing in accelerated safeguard and or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, therefore some provisions relating in particular to ongoing contracts and restitution claims formed by owners are excluded by law. The accelerated safeguard proceeding has effect against pre-insolvency creditors that have to file a proof of claim (see below) and as a consequence trade creditors notably will be involved in the accelerated safeguard proceedings, whereas accelerated financial safeguard proceedings only involve financial creditors (i.e., members of the credit institutions committee and the bondholders’ general assembly), with no impact on suppliers or public creditors notably (who will thus continue to be paid according to their applicable contract terms and are not subject to the automatic stay applicable during the observation period). The regime applicable to accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is similar to the one applicable to accelerated safeguard proceedings (which is now designed as the common accelerated proceeding, the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings being a variety of the latter, designed to “fast-track” purely financial difficulties). To be eligible to accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debtor must fulfill the following conditions: - the debtor must be subject to ongoing conciliation proceedings when it applies for the opening of the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings; 454 ----- - the debtor must not be insolvent for more than 45 days when it initially requested the opening of conciliation; - as is the case for regular safeguard proceedings, the debtor must face difficulties that it is not in a position to overcome; - in the context of conciliation proceedings, the debtor must have prepared a draft safeguard plan that aims to protect its operations in the long run and which is likely to be supported, within the group of those creditors who will be affected by the accelerated safeguard proceedings, by a sufficiently large majority of them to allow a likely adoption of the plan by the relevant creditors’ committees and bondholders general assembly, if any, within the duration of the procedure; and - the debtor must (i) have its accounts certified by a statutory auditor or established by an accountant and (x) have more than twenty employees; or (y) have a turnover greater than €3 million excluding any applicable taxes; or (z) have total assets in its balance sheet greater than €1.5 million or (ii) establish consolidated financial statements in accordance with article L. 233-16 of the French Commercial Code. If the debtor does not meet the conditions that require creditors’ committees (see above) to be constituted, the court shall authorize such constitution in the opening decision. However, Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law No. 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 provide that these thresholds will no longer be required for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021. Where accelerated safeguard proceedings are opened, the creditors’ committees (only the credit institutions committee in accelerated financial safeguard proceedings) and the bondholders’ general assembly are convened and are required to vote on the proposed accelerated safeguard plan within the minimum period of 15 days of delivery of the proposed plan (applicable in safeguard proceedings) (eight days in accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). The plan is adopted following the same majority rules as in regular safeguard proceedings and it may notably provide for a debt rescheduling, and/or debt cancellation, and/or conversion of debt into equity (requiring the relevant shareholder consent). The total duration of the accelerated safeguard proceedings is three months, while the duration of the accelerated financial safeguard proceedings is one month, unless the court decides to extend it by one additional month. If no plan is adopted by the creditors committee(s) and the bondholders’ general assembly at the relevant majority rules within such timeframe, the court shall terminate the accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings and may not impose any uniform debt rescheduling. By exception, Ordinance No. 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 and Law No. 2020-1525 dated December 7, 2020 provide that for proceedings commenced between May 22, 2020 and December 31, 2021, if a plan is not adopted by the creditors and approved by the court within the applicable time limits the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors representative or the Public Prosecutor may request, without any delay, that reorganization or liquidation proceedings (as the case may be) be opened.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The debtor is required to petition for judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings, within 45 days of becoming insolvent if it does not file for conciliation proceedings (as discussed above); de jure managers (including directors) and, as the case may be, de facto managers that would have failed to file such a petition within the deadline are exposed to civil liability. The court ruling commencing the proceedings may order either the liquidation or the reorganization of the company. (See “—The observation period and its outcome” and “—Creditors’ committees and adoption of the _safeguard or reorganization plan” for a description of the observation period and the consultation of the creditors_ on the draft reorganization plan). At any time during the observation period, the court can, upon request from the debtor, the judicial administrator, the creditors’ representative, a controller, the Public Prosecutor, or upon its own motion, order the liquidation of the company if recovery of the debtor is manifestly impossible. As soon as judicial reorganization or judicial liquidation proceedings are commenced, any unpaid amount of share capital of the debtor becomes immediately due and payable. 455 ----- In the event of judicial reorganization proceedings, a court-appointed administrator (administrateur _judiciaire) is usually appointed (and compulsorily appointed as case specific thresholds are reached) by the court_ to investigate the business of the debtor during the observation period (which may last up to 18 months as mentioned above), and make proposals either for the reorganization of the debtor (by elaborating a draft judicial reorganization plan, which is similar to a draft safeguard plan, with the contribution of the debtor), or the sale of all or part of the debtor’s business or the liquidation of the debtor. The court-appointed administrator will assist the debtor in making management decisions (mission d’assistance) or may be empowered by the court to take over the management and control of the debtor (mission d’administration). Judicial reorganization proceedings broadly take place in a manner that is similar to safeguard proceedings (see above), subject to certain specificities. In particular, the rules relating to creditor consultation on the draft reorganization plan are the same (see above). At any time during the observation period, the court can, at the request of the debtor, the court-appointed administrator, the creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire), the creditors of the debtor appointed by the court as controllers (“contrôleurs”) (if any), the public prosecutor or at its own initiative, order the partial stop of the activity (cessation partielle de l’activité) if no reorganization plan is proposed or if the said proposed plan is unlikely to ensure the turnaround of the debtor; or order the liquidation of the debtor if its recovery is manifestly impossible. At the end of the observation period, the outcome of the proceedings is decided by the court. In addition, Ordinance n° 2020-596 dated May 20, 2020 modified the judicial reorganization proceedings to provide for the new S/R Lien (as defined and detailed above see “—France – The Observation Period and its Outcome”). If the Court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator, who is generally the former creditors’ representative (mandataire judiciaire). There is no observation period in case of judicial liquidation proceedings being opened against the debtor. The outcome of these proceedings, which is decided by the court without a vote of the creditors, may be a plan for the sale of the business and/or isolated sales of the debtor’s assets in order to discharge the debtor’s liabilities. In case a plan for the sale of the business is considered, the court can authorize a temporary continuation of the business for a maximum period of three months (renewable once at the Public Prosecutor’s request), whose effects are similar to an observation period. The liquidator is vested with the power to represent the debtor and perform the liquidation operations (mainly liquidate the assets and settle the liabilities to the extent the proceeds from the liquidated assets are sufficient, in accordance with the creditors’ priority order of payment). The liquidator will take over the management and control of the debtor and the managers of the debtor are no longer in charge of its management. Concerning the liquidation of the assets of the debtor, there are two possible outcomes: - a sale of the business (cession d’entreprise) (in which case a court-appointed administrator (administrateur judiciaire) will usually be appointed, or remain in office if already appointed, to manage the debtor during a temporary period of continuation of the business operations ordered by the court (three months, renewable once) (during which the rules of the observation period will generally apply) and organize such sale of the business as a going-concern via an asset sale, a.k.a. a “sale plan” (plan de cession)), any third party (as construed under French insolvency law) being entitled to present a bid on all or part of the debtor’s business. As part of the bids submitted to the court, the third-party purchaser can cherry-pick assets (including the real estate assets)/jobs/contracts without the liabilities pertaining to them (save exceptions). The price offered for the transferred assets (including the real estate assets) is offered usually at a significant discount compared to their in _bonis market value. The court will tend to favor a credible sale plan, that ensures the sustainability of the_ business as a going concern, and the preservation of jobs, over the payment of creditors. Subject to certain exceptions, the court can judicially impose such a sale plan on creditors, including secured creditors and mortgagees as a general principle, the payment of the purchase price operating to release their security interests. By way of exception: - a purchaser is obliged to continue to pay the remaining instalments due to creditors having granted financing for the acquisition of assets, used as collateral for such creditors and included in the sale of the business plan; and - only those secured creditors benefitting from a retention right (which is the case for pledges over inventory or certain types of pledges over shares, but not mortgages over real estate assets) would be 456 ----- entitled to retain their security interest over the asset on which they have such right (and therefore in practice prevent it from being transferred) until repaid in full of their claim so secured or unless reaching an agreement with the relevant parties. Third-party purchasers may also submit combined bids in respect of all or part of the business of several debtors subject to insolvency proceedings, in particular when the key assets are located in different legal entities subject to insolvency proceedings. Again, the price offered for the transferred assets could be significantly less than their in bonis market value; - a sale of the individual assets of the debtor, in which case the liquidator may decide to: - launch auction sales (vente aux enchères or adjudication amiable for real estate assets only); - sell on an amicable basis (vente de gré à gré) each asset for which spontaneous purchase offers have been received (the formal authorization of the insolvency judge being necessary to conclude the sale agreement with the bidder); or - request, under the supervision of the bankruptcy judge, all potential interested purchasers to bid on each asset, as the case may be, by way of a private competitive process whereby the bidders submit their offers only at the hearing without the proposed prices being disclosed before such hearing (procédure des plis cachetés). However, the possibility to implement such process is questioned by certain legal authors and case-law in this respect has varied. If the court adopts a reorganization or sale plan, it can set a time-period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continuation of the business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. With regards to judicial liquidation proceedings, the court will end the proceedings when either no due liabilities remain following repayment in full of the creditors (extinction du passif), or continuation of the liquidation process becomes impossible due to a shortfall of assets (insuffisance d’actif). In the event where there are insufficient funds to pay off the creditors, the court may appoint a trustee in charge of continuing ongoing lawsuits and allocating the amounts received from these lawsuits between the remaining creditors. The court may also terminate the judicial liquidation proceedings when the interest of the continuation of the liquidation process is disproportionate compared to the difficulty of selling the assets.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

However, in the decision commencing judicial reorganization or liquidation proceedings or in a subsequent decision, a court may decide that the date when the debtor became unable to pay its debts be deemed to be an earlier date of up to 18 months prior to the court decision commencing the proceedings. The date when the debtor became unable to pay its debt is important because it marks the beginning of the “hardening period”. Certain transactions entered into by the debtor during the hardening period are, by law, void or voidable by the court. Except in the case of fraud, the insolvency date may not be set at a date earlier than the date of the final court decision that approved an agreement (homologation) in the context of conciliation proceedings (see above). Automatically void transactions include transactions or payments entered into during the hardening period that may constitute voluntary preferences for the benefit of some creditors to the detriment of other creditors. These include transfers of assets for no consideration, contracts under which the reciprocal obligations of the debtor significantly exceed those of the other party, payments of debts not due at the time of payment, payments made in a manner which is not commonly used in the ordinary course of business, deposit of cash or monetary instruments ordered by a court decision that has not yet become final to serve as guarantee or as precautionary measure in accordance with Article 2350 of the French Civil Code, security granted for debts previously incurred and provisional measures, unless the right of attachment or seizure predates the date of cessation des paiements, share options granted or sold during the hardening period, the transfer of any assets or rights to a trust arrangement (fiducie) (unless such transfer is made as a security for debt incurred at the same time), and any amendment to a trust arrangement (fiducie) that dedicates assets or rights as a guaranty of pre-existing debts. Voidable transactions include, (i) transactions for consideration entered into, (ii) payments made on accrued debts after the date of cessation des paiements or (iii) notices of attachments made to third parties (avis à tiers _détenteur), seizures (saisie attribution) and oppositions, in each case, if such actions are taken after the debtor_ 457 ----- was in cessation des paiements and the party dealing with the debtor knew (or could not ignore) that the debtor was in cessation des paiements at that time. In addition, transactions relating to transfers of assets for no consideration are also voidable when carried out during the six-month period prior to the beginning of the hardening period.

At the beginning of the proceedings, the debtor must provide the administrator and the creditors’ representative with the list of all its creditors and all of their claims. Where the debtor has informed the creditors’ representative of the existence of a claim and no proof of a claim has been filed yet, such claim is deemed filed with the creditors’ representative. Creditors are allowed to confirm a proof of claim made on their behalf. Creditors who have not submitted their claims during the relevant period, whose claims are not deemed filed with the creditors’ representative save for a ratification by the creditor of a proof of claim made on its behalf, are barred, except with respect to very limited exceptions, from receiving distributions made in accordance with the proceedings. Employees are not subject to such limitations and are preferential creditors under French law. In accelerated safeguard and accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the debts held by creditors that took part in the conciliation proceedings are listed by the debtor and certified by its statutory auditor (or, in its absence, its accountant) and are thus deemed to have been filed. Although such creditors can file proofs of claim pursuant to the regular process, they may also avail themselves of this simplified alternative and merely adjust the amounts of their claims as set forth on the list prepared by the debtor (within the two or four months’ time limit). Those creditors who did not take part in the conciliation proceedings (but who would be members of the creditors’ committees or the bondholders’ general meeting) would have to file their proofs of claim within the above-mentioned legal time limit. During the observation period: - accrual of interest is suspended (except in respect of loans providing for an initial term of at least one year, or contracts providing for a payment which is differed by at least one year); the debtor is prohibited from paying debts having arisen after the commencement of the proceedings (i) unless they were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor and (ii) subject to specified exceptions which essentially cover the set-off of related debts (compensation pour dettes connexes), and payments 458 ----- authorized by the supervising judge (juge-commissaire) and to recover assets for which recovery is justified by the continued operation of the business; - debts duly arising after the commencement of the proceedings and that were incurred for the purposes of the proceedings or of the observation period, or in consideration of services rendered/goods provided to the debtor during this period, must be paid as and when they fall due and, if not, will be given priority over debts incurred prior to the commencement of the proceedings (with certain limited exceptions, such as claims secured by a New Money Lien), provided that they are duly brought to the attention of the judicial administrator or, failing one, the mandataire judiciaire, or, should they both have ceased to be in office, the plan commissioner or the judicial liquidator within one year of the end of the observation period; - creditors may not initiate or pursue any individual legal action against the debtor (or, in safeguard or reorganization proceedings, against a guarantor of the debtor provided such guarantor is an individual) with respect to any claim arising prior to the court decision commencing the insolvency proceedings if the objective of such legal action is: - to obtain an order for payment of a sum of money by the debtor to the creditor (however, the creditor may require that a court determine the amount due); - to terminate or cancel a contract for non-payment of pre-petition amounts owed to the creditor; or - to enforce the creditor’s rights against any assets of the debtor, except where such asset—whether tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable—is located in another Member State within the European Union, in which case the rights in rem of creditors thereon would not be affected by the insolvency procedure, in accordance with the terms of article 8 of EC Regulation No. 2015/845 (Recast) with respect to insolvency proceedings opened after June 26, 2017. Similarly, the rights of a creditor on the debtor’s assets located outside France (and the EU) would only be affected by the French insolvency proceedings if they were to be recognized by the local courts where the assets at stake are located (unless provided otherwise in a treaty to which France is a party). A natural person that is the guarantor of the debtor may avail itself of the provisions of a safeguard plan adopted by the Court, not of the provisions of a judicial reorganization plan. In accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings, the above rules only apply to the creditors which are subject to those proceedings. Debts owed to other creditors, such as suppliers, continue to be payable according to their contractual / usual terms. Contractual provisions such as those contained in the relevant Indenture that would accelerate the payment of the debtor’s obligations upon the occurrence of certain insolvency events are not enforceable under French law, and the court-appointed officer can unilaterally decide to terminate ongoing contracts (contrats en cours) which it believes the debtor will not be able to continue to perform. The court-appointed officer can, on the contrary, require that other parties to a contract continue to perform their obligations even though the debtor may have been in default, but on the condition that such debtor fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations. The opening of liquidation proceedings does, however, automatically accelerate the maturity of all of the debtor’s obligations, unless the court allows the business to continue for a period of no more than three months (renewable once) if it considers that a sale of part or all of the business is possible. In this case, the debtor’s obligations are deemed mature on the day the court approves the sale of the business or the end of the period of continuation of the business. Contractual provisions pursuant to which the opening of the proceedings constitutes an event of default are not enforceable against the debtor, as well as, according to a decision of the French Supreme Court dated January 14, 2014, n°12-22.909, “contractual provisions modifying the conditions of continuation of an ongoing contract, diminishing the rights or increasing the obligations of the debtor solely upon the opening of reorganization proceedings” (which should also apply in case of safeguard, accelerated safeguard or accelerated financial safeguard proceedings). The administrator may also terminate (except for employment contracts) or, provided that the debtor fully performs its post-petition contractual obligations, continue to execute contracts. During reorganization proceedings, when the ongoing contract involves the payment of a sum of money, this payment must be made in cash, unless the administrator obtains extended payment deadlines from the contractual partner of the debtor; the administrator is under an obligation to verify that by continuing the contract he or she does not risk creating a foreseeable damage for the contractual partner. 459 ----- The commencement of liquidation proceedings, however, automatically accelerates the maturity of all of a debtor’s obligations unless the Court orders the continued operation of the business with a view to the adoption of a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) (see above). In such case, the acceleration of the obligations will only occur on the date of the Court decision adoption of a plan for the sale of the business (plan _de cession), or on the date on which the continued operation of the business ends._ If the Court adopts a safeguard plan or a reorganization plan, claims of creditors included in the plan will be paid according to the terms of the plan. The court can also set a time period during which the assets that it deems to be essential to the continued business of the debtor may not be sold without its consent. If the court adopts a plan for the sale of the business (plan de cession) in reorganization or liquidation proceedings, the proceeds of the sale will be allocated for the repayment of the creditors according to the ranking of their claims. If the court decides to order the judicial liquidation of the debtor, the court will appoint a liquidator in charge of selling the assets of the company and settling the relevant debts in accordance with their ranking. However, in practice, where a plan for the sale of the business is considered, it will usually appoint a judicial administrator to manage the company and organize such sale of the business process. French insolvency law assigns priority to the payment of certain preferential creditors, including employees (for certain claims that arose prior to the opening of the insolvency), post-petition legal cost (essentially fees of officials appointed by the insolvency court as required by the regulations relating to insolvency proceedings), creditors benefiting from the New Money Lien (see above), certain pre-petition secured creditors in judicial liquidation proceedings only, post-petition creditors, the French State (taxes and social charges), other pre-petition secured creditors and pre-petition unsecured creditors.

In addition, any security or guarantees taken to support facilities in respect of which a creditor is found liable on any of these grounds can be cancelled or reduced by the court. Case law has recently set out that this liability would also require that the granting of the facility be deemed to be wrongful. If a creditor has repeatedly interfered in the company’s management, it can be deemed a de facto manager of such company (“dirigeant de fait”). In such case, liability for shortfall of assets as set out by article L 651-2 of the French Commercial Code might apply. This statutory provision provides that, if liquidation proceedings have been commenced against the debtor, the creditor being deemed de facto manager may be liable for bearing the excess of liabilities over the company’s assets, along with the other managers (whether de jure or de facto), as the case may be, if it is established that its mismanagement has contributed to the company’s shortfall of assets. If such conditions are met, French courts will decide whether the managers should bear all or part of the shortfall amount.

If a court finds that these conditions are satisfied, it may also open ex officio bankruptcy proceedings, absent a request made by the company or a creditor. The main effects of such proceedings are (i) the suspension of all measures of enforcement against the company, except, subject to certain limited exceptions, for secured creditors and the payment of the secured creditors, and (ii) the payment of the Luxembourg company’s creditors in accordance with their rank upon realization of the Luxembourg company’s assets; - Controlled management proceedings (gestion contrôlée), the opening of which may only be requested by the relevant Luxembourg company and not by its creditors; a reorganization order requires the prior approval by more than 50% of the number of creditors representing more than 50% of the company’s liabilities in order to take effect; and - Composition proceedings (concordat préventif de la faillite), the obtaining of which is requested by the relevant Luxembourg company only after having received prior consent from the majority of its unsecured creditors holding at least 75% of the claims against such company. The obtaining of such composition proceedings will trigger a provisional stay on enforcement of claims by participating creditors while other creditors may pursue their claims individually. In addition to these proceedings, your ability to receive payment on the Notes may be affected by a decision of a court to grant a suspension of payments (sursis de paiement) as provided under articles 593 et seq. of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce or to put the relevant Luxembourg company into judicial liquidation (liquidation judiciaire) pursuant to article 1200-1 of the Luxembourg Companies Law. Winding-up proceedings may be opened at the request of the public prosecutor against companies pursuing an activity violating criminal laws or that are in serious breach or violation of the commercial code or of the laws governing commercial companies. The management of such winding up proceedings will generally follow the rules of bankruptcy proceedings. Liabilities of a Guarantor or an Issuer in respect of the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs or the Senior Notes will in the event of a liquidation of a Guarantor or an Issuer following bankruptcy or judicial 461 ----- winding-up proceedings, rank below the cost of such proceedings (including any debt incurred for the purpose of such bankruptcy or judicial winding-up) and those debts of the relevant Luxembourg company that are entitled to priority under Luxembourg law. Preferential rights arising by operation of law under Luxembourg law include: - certain amounts owed to the Luxembourg Revenue; - value-added tax and other taxes and duties owed to the Luxembourg Customs and Excise; - social security contributions; and - remuneration owed to employees. For the avoidance of doubt, the above list is not exhaustive. Assets over which a security interest has been granted will in principle not be available for distribution to unsecured creditors (except after enforcement and to the extent a surplus is realized). During such insolvency proceedings, all enforcement measures by unsecured creditors are suspended. Luxembourg insolvency laws may also affect transactions entered into or payments made by a Luxembourg company during the period before bankruptcy, the so-called “hardening period” (période suspecte), which is a maximum of six months, as from the date on which the commercial court formally adjudicates a person bankrupt, and, as for specific payments and transactions, during an additional period of ten days before the commencement of such period preceding the judgment declaring bankruptcy, except that in certain specific situations the court may set the start of the suspect period at an earlier date, if the bankruptcy judgment was preceded by another insolvency proceeding (e.g., a suspension of payments or controlled management proceedings) under Luxembourg law. These situations are: - pursuant to article 445 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, specified transactions (such as, in particular, the granting of a security interest for antecedent debts; the payment of debts which have not fallen due, whether payment is made in cash or by way of assignment, sale, set-off or by any other means; the payment of debts which have fallen due by any means other than in cash or by bill of exchange; the sale of assets or entering into transactions generally without consideration or with substantially inadequate consideration) entered into during the suspect period (or the ten days preceding it) will be set aside or declared null and void, if so requested by the bankruptcy receiver; article 445 does not apply to financial collateral arrangements and set-off arrangements subject to the Luxembourg Collateral Law, such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares or receivables to the extent that they secure payment obligations and/or obligations to deliver financial instruments on the underlying assets of such instruments; - pursuant to article 446 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce, payments made for matured debts for consideration, as well as other transactions concluded during the hardening period (période suspecte), are subject to cancellation by the court upon proceedings instituted by the insolvency receiver if they were concluded with the knowledge of the bankrupt’s cessation of payments; article 446 does not apply to financial collateral arrangements and set-off arrangements subject to the Luxembourg Collateral Law, such as Luxembourg law pledges over shares or receivables to the extent that they secure payment obligations and/or obligations to deliver financial instruments on the underlying assets of such instruments; and - regardless of the hardening period (période suspecte), article 448 of the Luxembourg Code of Commerce and article 1167 of the Luxembourg Civil Code (action paulienne) give any creditor the right to challenge any fraudulent payments and transactions made prior to the bankruptcy. In principle, a bankruptcy order rendered by a Luxembourg court does not result in automatic termination of contracts except for intuitu personae contracts, that is, contracts for which the identity of the company or its solvency were crucial. The contracts, therefore, subsist after the bankruptcy order. However, the insolvency receiver may choose to terminate certain contracts so as to avoid worsening the financial situation of the company. As of the date of adjudication of bankruptcy, no interest on any unsecured claim will accrue vis-à-vis the bankruptcy estate. Insolvency proceedings may therefore have a material adverse effect on a Luxembourg company’s business and assets and the Luxembourg company’s respective obligations under the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs or the Senior Notes. The bankruptcy receiver decides whether or not to continue performance under ongoing contracts (i.e., contracts existing before the bankruptcy order). The bankruptcy receiver may elect to continue the business of 462 ----- the debtor, provided the bankruptcy receiver obtains the authorization of the court and such continuation does not cause any prejudice to the creditors. However, two exceptions apply: - the parties to an agreement may contractually agree that the occurrence of a bankruptcy constitutes an early termination or acceleration event; and - _intuitu personae contracts (i.e., contracts whereby the identity of the other party constitutes an essential element upon the signing of the contract) are automatically terminated as of the bankruptcy judgment since the debtor is no longer responsible for the management of the company. Parties can agree to continue to perform under such contracts. The bankruptcy receiver may elect not to perform the obligations of the bankrupt party that are still to be performed after the bankruptcy under any agreement validly entered into by the bankrupt party prior to the bankruptcy. The counterparty to that agreement may make a claim for damages in the bankruptcy and such claim will rank pari passu with claims of all other unsecured creditors and/or seek a court order to have the relevant contract dissolved. The counterparty may not require specific performance of the contract.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The objectives of the EU Restructuring Directive are to ensure that (i) viable enterprises and entrepreneurs that are in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventive restructuring frameworks that enable them to continue operating, (ii) honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs (i.e., individuals) can benefit from a full discharge of debt after a reasonable period of time, thereby affording them a second chance and (iii) the effectiveness of procedures concerning restructuring, insolvency and discharge of debt is improved, in particular with a view to shortening their length. The Restructuring Directive aims to achieve a higher degree of harmonization in the field of restructuring, insolvency, discharge of debt and disqualifications by establishing substantive minimum standards for preventive restructuring procedures as well as for procedures leading to a discharge of debt for entrepreneurs in order to promote a culture that encourages early preventive restructuring to address financial difficulties at an early stage, when it appears likely that insolvency can be prevented and the viability of the business can be ensured. Most notably, the Restructuring Directive provides for a framework pursuant to which (i) a stay of individual enforcement actions by creditors against debtors must be introduced by Member States national legislation, (ii) all creditor claims shall be grouped into separate classes each of which shall reflect a commonality of interests (at a minimum, creditors of secured and unsecured claims shall be treated in separate classes), (iii) creditor claims may be restructured in a restructuring plan by majority vote with a majority of not more than 465 ----- 75% of the amount of the claims in each class and, where the Member State so requires, a majority in number of affected parties in each class and (iv) a cross-class cram-down is introduced whereby a restructuring plan may, under certain conditions, be adopted and bind dissenting creditors even if the creditors of one or more classes do not consent to the restructuring plan with the required majority. The transposition of the Restructuring Directive into national legislation shall protect new and interim financing and other restructuring related transactions and may also provide priority ranking to new or interim financing granted in the context of the restructuring. The EU Restructuring Directive shall be transposed into national laws or regulations by Member States by July 17, 2021 (with the exception of the provisions relating to the use of electronic means of communication for which the time period for the transposition expires in certain respects on July 1, 2024 or, in others, on July 17, 2026), subject to a maximum one year extension of the transposition period for Member States encountering particular difficulties in implementing the EU Restructuring Directive.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court which shall have jurisdiction to open insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is the court of the Member State (other than Denmark) where the company concerned has its “centre of main interests” (as that term is used in Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation). The determination of where any such company has its “centre of main interests” is a question of fact on which the courts of the different Member States may have differing and even conflicting views. The term “centre of main interests” is not a static concept and may change from time to time. Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation provides that a company has its COMI in the Member State in which it “conducts the administration of its interests on a regular basis and which is ascertainable by third parties”. There is a presumption under Article 3(1) of the EU Insolvency Regulation that a company has its COMI in the Member State in which it has its registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary (that presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings). However, the EU Insolvency Regulation also states in its preamble at Recital 30 that it should be possible to rebut this presumption if a debtor’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that of its registered office and a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the debtor’s actual centre of management and supervision and the management of its interests is located in that other Member State. Under the previous EC regulation (Council Regulation (EC) 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000), which defined the COMI in similar terms, Courts have taken into consideration a number of factors in determining the COMI of a company, including in particular, where board meetings are held, the location where the company conducts the majority of its business or has its head office and the location where the majority of the company’s creditors are established. The time when a company’s “centre of main interests” is determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are opened. If the centre of main interests of a company is and will remain located in the state in which it has its registered office, the main insolvency proceedings in respect of the company under the EU Insolvency Regulation would be opened in such jurisdiction, and, accordingly, a court in such jurisdiction would be entitled to open the types of insolvency proceedings referred to in Annex A to the EU Insolvency Regulation. Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be recognized in the other Member States (other than Denmark), although secondary proceedings may be opened in another Member State. If main insolvency proceedings are validly opened in one Member State, they will be recognized and have effect in all other Member States (other than Denmark) pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation. If the “centre of main interests” of a debtor is in one Member State (other than Denmark) under Article 3(2) of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of another Member State (other than Denmark) have jurisdiction to open “secondary proceedings” only in the event that such debtor has an “establishment” (in the meaning of the EU Insolvency 463 ----- Regulation) in the territory of such other Member State. An “establishment” is defined in Article 2(10) of the EU Insolvency Regulation as “any place of operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the threemonth period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets”. Accordingly, the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings in another Member State will also be possible if the debtor had an establishment in such Member State in the three-month period prior to the request for commencement of main insolvency proceedings. The effects of those secondary proceedings are restricted to the assets of the debtor situated in the territory of such other Member State. If the company does not have an establishment in any other Member State, no court of any other Member State has jurisdiction to open territorial proceedings in respect of such company under the EU Insolvency Regulation. Where main proceedings in the Member State in which the debtor has its COMI have not yet been commenced, territorial insolvency proceedings may only be commenced in another Member State where the debtor has an establishment where either (i) insolvency proceedings cannot be commenced in the Member State in which the debtor’s COMI is situated under that Member State’s law or (ii) the territorial insolvency proceedings are commenced at the request of (a) a creditor whose claim arises from or is in connection with the operation of an establishment situated within the territory of the Member State where the commencement of territorial proceedings is requested or (b) a public authority that has the right to make such a request under the law of the Member State in which the establishment is located. Irrespective of whether the insolvency proceedings are main or territorial/secondary insolvency proceedings, such proceedings will, subject to certain exceptions, be governed but the lex fori concursus, i.e., the local insolvency law of the court that has assumed jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of the debtor. Pursuant to Article 6 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the courts of the Member State within the territory of which insolvency proceedings have been opened in accordance with its Article 3 shall have jurisdiction for any action that derives directly from the insolvency proceedings and is closely linked with them, such as avoidance actions. The opening of insolvency proceedings in a Member State pursuant to the EU Insolvency Regulation shall not affect the rights in rem of creditors or third parties in respect of tangible or intangible, moveable or immoveable assets, both specific assets and collections of indefinite assets as a whole that change from time to time, belonging to the debtor that are situated within the territory of another Member State at the time of the opening of proceedings. Rights in rem include: - the right to dispose of assets or have them disposed of and to obtain satisfaction from the proceeds of or income from those assets, in particular, by virtue of a lien or a mortgage; - the exclusive right to have a claim met, in particular, a right guaranteed by a lien in respect of the claim or by assignment of the claim by way of a guarantee; - the right to demand assets from, and/or to require restitution by, anyone having possession or use of them contrary to the wishes of the party so entitled; and - a right in rem to the beneficial use of assets. The courts of all Member States (other than Denmark) must recognize the judgement of the court commencing main proceedings that will be given the same effect in the other Member States so long as no secondary proceedings have been commenced there. The insolvency practitioner appointed by a court in a Member State which has jurisdiction to commence main proceedings (because the debtor’s COMI is there) may exercise the powers conferred on it by the laws of the Member State in another Member State (such as to remove assets of the debtor from that other Member State) subject to certain limitations (such as the preservation of third parties’ rights in rem), as long as no insolvency proceedings have been commenced in that other Member State or no preservation measures have been taken to the contrary, further to a request to commence insolvency proceedings in that other Member State where the debtor has assets. Article 36 of the EC Regulation provides for the right of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to give a unilateral undertaking to local creditors in respect of the assets located in the Member State in which secondary insolvency proceedings could be opened, that when distributing those assets or the proceeds received as a result of their realization, it will comply with the distribution and priority rights under national law that creditors would have if secondary insolvency proceedings were opened in that Member State. This undertaking shall be approved by a qualified majority of known local creditors, determined in accordance with the local law of such other Member State. If approved, the undertaking is binding on the estate and a court shall, 464 ----- at the request of the insolvency practitioner, refuse to open secondary insolvency proceedings if it considers that the undertaking sufficiently protects the general interests of the local creditors. Additionally, under Article 38 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, where a temporary stay of individual enforcement proceedings has been granted in order to allow for negotiations between a company and its creditors, the court, at the request of the company or of the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, may stay the opening of secondary insolvency proceedings for a period not exceeding three months, provided that suitable measures are in place to protect the interests of local creditors. Under Article 46 of the EU Insolvency Regulation, the court that opened the secondary insolvency proceedings will also stay the process of realization of assets in whole or in part upon receipt of a request from the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings, for a period of up to three months, unless such a request is manifestly of no interest to the creditors in the main insolvency proceedings. Such stay may be continued or renewed for similar periods. Where the court stays the process of realization of the assets, the court may require the insolvency practitioner in the main insolvency proceedings to take any suitable measure to guarantee the interests of the creditors in the secondary insolvency proceedings and of individual classes of creditors. The EU Insolvency Regulation provides: - for cooperation and communication between insolvency practitioners of the main insolvency proceedings and of the secondary insolvency proceedings and, in order to facilitate the coordination of main, territorial and secondary insolvency proceedings concerning the same debtor for cooperation and communication between (i) courts and (ii) insolvency practitioners and courts; - for specific cooperation, communication and coordination measures in order to ensure the efficient administration of insolvency proceedings relating to different companies forming part of the same group; - that the Member States shall establish and maintain a register of insolvency proceedings; and - that the European Commission shall establish a decentralized system for the interconnection of such insolvency registers. To the extent that the “centre of main interests” of any of the Issuers is deemed to be in France or elsewhere outside Luxembourg, courts of France or such other jurisdictions may have jurisdiction over the insolvency proceedings of such company.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

As a consequence, Luxembourg law will apply in relation to the creation, perfection and enforcement of security interests over assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg, such as registered shares in Luxembourg companies, bank accounts held with a Luxembourg bank, receivables or claims governed by Luxembourg law and/or having debtors located in Luxembourg, tangible assets located in Luxembourg, securities that are held through an account located in Luxembourg, bearer securities physically located in Luxembourg, etc. The Luxembourg Collateral Law governs the creation, validity, perfection and enforcement of pledges over shares, bank accounts and receivables located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Under the Luxembourg Collateral Law, the perfection of security interests depends on certain registration, notification and acceptance requirements. A pledge agreement over shares must be (i) notified or accepted by the company that has issued the shares (subject to the security interest) and/or (ii) registered in the shareholders’ register of such company. If future shares are pledged, additional registration in the shareholders’ register of such company will be required. A pledge over receivables becomes enforceable against the debtor of the receivables and third parties from the moment the agreement pursuant to which the pledge was created is entered into between the pledgor and the pledgee. However, if the debtor has not been notified of the pledge or if he or she did not otherwise acquire knowledge of the pledge, he or she will be validly discharged if he or she pays the pledgor. A bank account pledge agreement must be notified to and accepted by the account bank so as to ensure that the account bank has waived any pre-existing security interests and other rights in respect of the relevant account. If (future) bank accounts are pledged, such additional notification to, acceptance and waiver by the account bank will be required. Article 11 of the Luxembourg Collateral Law sets forth enforcement remedies available upon the occurrence of an enforcement event, including, but not limited to: - appropriation by the pledgee or appropriation by a third party of the pledged assets at (i) a value determined in accordance with a valuation method agreed upon by the parties or (ii) (if listed) the listing price of the pledged assets; - sale or causing the sale of the pledged assets (i) in a private transaction on commercially reasonable terms (conditions commerciales normales), (ii) by a public sale on the stock exchange (if listed shares) or (iii) by way of a public auction; - court allocation of the pledged assets to the pledgee in discharge of the secured obligations following a valuation made by a court-appointed expert; or - set-off between the secured obligations and the pledged assets. The Luxembourg Collateral Law does not provide any specific time periods, so depending on (i) the method chosen, (ii) the valuation of the pledged assets, (iii) any possible recourses and (iv) the possible need to involve third parties, such as courts, stock exchanges and appraisers, the enforcement of the security interests might be substantially delayed. The Luxembourg Collateral Law expressly provides that financial collateral arrangements (including pledges) including enforcement measures are valid and enforceable, even if entered into during the hardening 466 ----- period, against third parties including supervisory, receivers, liquidators and any other similar persons or bodies irrespective of any bankruptcy, liquidation or other situation, national or foreign, of composition with creditors or reorganization affecting any one of the parties. Foreign law governed security interests and the powers of any receivers or administrators may not be enforceable in respect of assets located or deemed to be located in Luxembourg. Security interests or arrangements that are not expressly recognized under Luxembourg law and the powers of any receivers or administrators might not be recognized or enforced by the Luxembourg courts, even over assets located outside of Luxembourg, particularly where the relevant Luxembourg security provider or entity becomes subject to Luxembourg insolvency proceedings or where the Luxembourg courts otherwise have jurisdiction because of the actual or deemed location of the relevant rights or assets, except if “main insolvency proceedings” (as defined in the EU Insolvency Regulation) are opened under Luxembourg law and such security interests/arrangements constitute rights in rem over assets located in another EU Member State in which the EU Insolvency Regulation applies, and in accordance with Article 8 of the EU Insolvency Regulation. Finally, the appointment of a foreign security agent will be recognized under Luxembourg law: (i) to the extent that the designation is valid under the law governing such appointment; and (ii) subject to possible restrictions. Generally, according to paragraph 2(4) of the Luxembourg Collateral Law, a security (financial collateral) may be provided in favor of a person acting on behalf of the collateral taker, a fiduciary or a trustee in order to secure the claims of third-party beneficiaries, whether present or future, provided that these third-party beneficiaries are determined or may be determined. Without prejudice to their obligations vis-à-vis third-party beneficiaries of the security, persons acting on behalf of beneficiaries of the security, the fiduciary or the trustee benefit from the same rights as those of the direct beneficiaries of the security aimed at by such law.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Although there is no Luxembourg legislation or published authoritative court precedent which specifically regulates this matter, there is a general consensus among Luxembourg authors and practitioners that the granting of such an upstream or downstream guarantee is unlikely to raise any particular concerns but is still subject to specific limitations and requirements relating to corporate purpose (objet social) and corporate benefit (intérêt social) considerations. The existence of corporate benefit is a factual matter which is not defined by law and must be determined on a case-by-case basis. Based on current French and Belgian case law (to which Luxembourg courts are likely to refer in this context), and provided that the granting of guarantee(s) to, or in favor of, companies within the group to which the Guarantor belongs is within the corporate purpose of the Luxembourg guarantor and has been properly approved by a decision of its representative body(ies), it is generally understood that a Luxembourg entity may assist other group companies if some conditions are met. It is generally held that within a group of companies, the corporate interest of each individual corporate entity should, to a certain extent, be tempered by, and subordinated to, the interests of the group. A reciprocal assistance from one group company to another does not necessarily conflict with the interest of the assisting company. However, this assistance must be temporary, in proportion with the real financial means of the assisting company or have a reciprocal character. A Luxembourg Guarantor may give an upstream guarantee (and to the extent that the amounts received under the Notes are not made available, in any form whatsoever, to such Luxembourg Guarantor) provided the giving of the guarantee is covered by the Guarantor’s corporate objectives and is in the best interests of the Guarantor. The test regarding the Guarantor’s corporate interest is whether the Guarantor that provides the guarantee receives some consideration in return (such as an economic or commercial benefit) and whether the benefit is proportional to the burden of the assistance. A guarantee that substantially exceeds the Guarantor’s ability to meet its obligations to the beneficiary of the guarantee and to its other creditors would expose its directors or managers to personal liability. Furthermore, under certain circumstances, the managers or directors of the Luxembourg Guarantor might incur criminal penalties based on the concept of misuse of corporate assets (Article 1500-11 of the Luxembourg Companies Law). The guarantees granted by a Luxembourg Guarantor may, in certain circumstances, be limited to a certain percentage of, among others, the relevant Guarantor’s net worth. A guarantee granted by a Luxembourg Guarantor could, if submitted to a Luxembourg court, depending on the terms of such guarantee, possibly be construed by such court as a suretyship (cautionnement) and not a first demand guarantee or an independent guarantee. Article 2012 of the Luxembourg Civil Code provides that the validity and the enforceability of a suretyship (which constitutes an accessory obligation) is subject to the validity of the underlying obligation. It follows that if the underlying obligations were invalid or challenged, it cannot be excluded that the Luxembourg Guarantor would be released from its liabilities under the guarantee. 467 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

We will apply, through our listing sponsor, to list the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs and the Senior Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and to have the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs and the Senior Notes admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange; however, we cannot assure you that the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs and the Senior Notes will be approved for listing or that such listing will be maintained. The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes after completing the Offerings. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any marketmaking activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by the Securities Act and the U.S. Exchange Act. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price which will be favorable to you. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating _Rate SSNs or the Senior Notes, respectively—There may not be an active trading market for the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs or the Senior Notes, respectively, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited”._ We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment on the Notes on or about the date specified on the cover page of this Offering Memorandum, which will be the U.S. business day (as such term is used for purposes of Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act) following the date of pricing of the Notes (this settlement cycle is being referred to as “T+ U.S. business days”). Under Rule 15c6-1 of the U.S. Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the Notes on the date of this Offering Memorandum or the next business days will be required to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Notes who wish to make such trades should consult their own advisors. In connection with the Offerings, the Stabilizing Managers, or persons acting on their behalf, may engage in transactions that stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Notes. Specifically, the relevant Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase the relevant Notes in the open markets to stabilize the price of the relevant Notes. The relevant Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on their behalf, may also over-allot the relevant Offering, creating a syndicate short position, and may bid for and purchase the relevant Notes in the open market to cover the syndicate short position. In addition, the relevant Stabilizing Manager, or persons acting on its behalf, may bid for and purchase the relevant Notes in market making transactions as permitted by applicable laws and regulations and impose penalty bids. These activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the relevant Notes above market levels that may otherwise prevail. The relevant Stabilizing Manager is not required to engage in these activities, and may end these activities at any time. Accordingly, no assurances can be given as to the liquidity of, or trading markets for, the Notes. See “Risk _Factors—Risks Related to our Indebtedness and the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs or the Senior Notes, respectively— There may not be an active trading market for the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs or the Senior Notes, respectively, in which case your ability to sell the Notes will be limited”._ The Initial Purchasers may engage in over-allotment, stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with Regulation M under the U.S. Exchange Act. Over-allotment involves sales in excess of the offering size, which creates a short position for the relevant Initial Purchasers. Stabilizing transactions permit bidders to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum. Covering transactions involve purchase of the Notes in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover short positions. Penalty bids permit the Initial Purchasers to reclaim a selling concession from a broker or dealer when the Notes originally sold by that broker or dealer are purchased in a stabilizing or covering transaction to cover short positions. 469 ----- In connection with each Offering, the relevant Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on their behalf), may over-allot Notes (provided that the aggregate principal amount of the relevant Notes allotted does not exceed 105% of the aggregate principal amount of such relevant Notes that are the subject of the relevant Offering) or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. Notwithstanding, there is no assurance that the relevant Stabilizing Manager (or persons acting on its behalf) will undertake stabilization action. Any stabilization action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the relevant Offering is made and, if begun, may be ended at any time, but it must end no later than 30 days after the date on which the relevant Issuer received the proceeds of the relevant Offering or 60 days after the date of the allotment of the relevant Notes, whichever is the earlier. These stabilizing transactions, covering transactions and penalty bids may cause the price of Notes to be higher than it would otherwise be in the absence of these transactions. These transactions, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates from time to time have provided in the past and may provide in the future investment banking, financial advisory and commercial banking services to the Issuers and their affiliates in the ordinary course of business for which they have received or may receive customary fees and commissions. In addition, each of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates acted as lead arrangers or as lenders under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility and received customary fees for their services in such capacities, HSBC Continental Europe S.A. is acting as RCF Agent under the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility Agreement and certain affiliates of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft will act as trustee and security agent under the Fixed Rate SSN Indenture, the Floating Rate SSN Indenture and the Super-Senior Revolving Credit Facility, and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacity. Furthermore, certain affiliates of Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft will act as trustee and security agent under the Senior Notes Indenture and will receive customary fees for their services in such capacity. Certain affiliates of the Initial Purchasers may perform, from time to time, advisory work for the shareholders of the Picard Group, and may be entitled to the payment of customary fees in connection with these roles. In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuers or their respective affiliates. If the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates have a lending relationship with the Issuers or its their affiliates, certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates routinely hedge, certain of those initial purchasers or their affiliates are likely to hedge, and certain of those Initial Purchasers or their affiliates may hedge, their credit exposure to the Issuer and/or its affiliates consistent with their customary risk management policies. 470 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

357,Offerings 2021.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.1,France,23.1.1,,"Our French counsel has advised us that the United States and France are not party to a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments, other than arbitral awards, rendered in civil and commercial matters. Accordingly, a judgment rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability, whether or not predicated solely upon U.S. federal or state securities laws, enforceable in the United States, would not directly be recognized or enforceable in France. A party in whose favor such judgment was rendered could initiate enforcement proceedings (exequatur) in France before the relevant civil court. Enforcement in France of such U.S. judgment could be obtained following proper (i.e., non-ex parte) proceedings if the civil court is satisfied that the following conditions have been met (which conditions, under prevailing French case law, do not include a review by the French court of the merits of the foreign judgment): - such U.S. judgment is enforceable in the U.S.; - the subject matter of such U.S. judgment is sufficiently or substantially connected with the jurisdiction of the court that rendered it, the choice of the U.S. court is not fraudulent and the French courts did not have exclusive jurisdiction over the matter; - such U.S. judgment does not contravene French international public policy rules, both pertaining to the merits and to the procedure of the case; - such U.S. judgment is not tainted with fraud; and - such U.S. judgment does not conflict with a French judgment or a foreign judgment which has become effective in France and there are no proceedings pending before French courts at the time enforcement of the judgment is sought and having the same or similar subject matter as such U.S. judgment. In addition, the discovery process under actions filed in the United States could be adversely affected under certain circumstances by French law No. 68-678 of July 26, 1968, as modified by French laws No. 80-538 of July 16, 1980 and order No. 2000-916 of September 19, 2000 (relating to communication of documents and information of an economic, commercial, industrial, financial or technical nature to foreign authorities or persons) and by French law No. 2018-670 of July 30, 2018 related to the protection of trade secrets, as amended from time to time, which could prohibit or restrict obtaining evidence in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action. 473 ----- Similarly, French data protection rules (in particular, law No. 78-17 of January 6, 1978 on data processing, data files and individual liberties, as mainly modified by French law No. 2018-493 of June 20, 2018, Decrees No. 2018-687 August 3 2018 and No. 2019-536 of May 29, 2019, as well as French Ordinances No. 2018-1125 of December 12, 2018 and No. 2019-964 of September 18, 2019) can limit under certain circumstances the possibility of obtaining information in France or from French persons in connection with a judicial or administrative U.S. action in a discovery context. We have been advised by our French counsel that if an original action is brought in France, French courts may refuse to apply the foreign law designated by applicable French rules of conflict of law (including the governing law chosen by the parties to the agreements) if its application contravenes French international public policy (ordre public international) or in the case of applicable overriding mandatory rules (lois de police). In an action brought in France on the basis of U.S. Federal or state securities laws, French courts may not have the requisite power to grant all the remedies sought. Our French counsel has also advised us that according to articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code, a French national (either a company or an individual) can sue a foreign defendant before French courts (article 14) and can be sued by a foreign claimant before French courts (article 15). For a long time, case law has interpreted these provisions as meaning that a French national, either claimant or defendant, could not be forced against its will to appear before a jurisdiction other than French courts. However, according to case law, the French court’s jurisdiction towards French nationals is no longer mandatory to the extent an action has been commenced before a court in a jurisdiction which has sufficient contacts with the litigation and the choice of jurisdiction is not fraudulent. In addition, the French national may waive its rights to benefit from the provisions of articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code. Under Regulation (EU) No. 1215-2012 of the European Parliament and of the EU Council dated December 12, 2012 (“EU Regulation 1215-2012”) regarding legal actions falling within the scope of EU Regulation 1215-2012, the privileges granted to French nationals pursuant to articles 14 and 15 of the French Civil Code may not be invoked against a person domiciled in a EU Member State. However, pursuant to article 6.2 of EU Regulation 1215-2012, the privilege granted by article 14 of the French Civil Code may be invoked by a claimant domiciled in France when bringing legal action against a defendant domiciled outside of the EU before French courts, irrespective of the claimant’s nationality. On two occasions, in September 26, 2012 and October, 7 2015, the Civil Chamber of the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) held that a contractual provision whereby one party agrees to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court and giving another party the option to choose any competent jurisdiction was invalid. The Commercial Chamber of the French Supreme Court (Cour de Cassation) has held the contrary by a decision dated May 11, 2017. Accordingly, any provisions to the same effect in any relevant documents may not be binding over the party having agreed to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
357,Offerings 2021.md,23,SERVICE OF PROCESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES,23.2,Luxembourg,23.2.1,,"In Luxembourg, it may be possible for investors to effect service of process upon the Floating Rate SSN Issuer, the SN Issuer and the Guarantors within Luxembourg in accordance with the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial Matters of November 15, 1965. Because the United States and Luxembourg do not have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, a final judgment for the payment of monies rendered by any U.S. federal or state court based on civil liability would not be directly enforceable in Luxembourg and would require recognition and enforcement proceedings (exequatur) before the Luxembourg courts in accordance with the Luxembourg rules for recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments. A party seeking to enforce a final judgment obtained in the U.S. courts, may initiate enforcement proceedings in the competent Luxembourg District Court (Tribunal d’Arrondissement) pursuant to the Luxembourg New Code of Civil Procedure (Nouveau Code de Procedure Civile). A valid judgment against the Floating Rate SSN Issuer, the SN Issuer or a Guarantor of Luxembourg nationality with respect to the Fixed Rate SSNs, the Floating Rate SSNs or the Senior Notes obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction in the United States, which judgment remains in full force and effect after all appeals as may be taken in the relevant state or federal jurisdiction with respect thereto have been taken, may be entered and enforced through a court of competent jurisdiction of Luxembourg subject to compliance with the 474 ----- specific execution procedures (exequatur) set out in Article 678 et seq. of the Luxembourg Nouveau Code de _Procédure Civile, which are:_ - the U.S. court awarding the judgment has jurisdiction to adjudicate the respective matter under its applicable laws and territorial rules, and such jurisdiction is recognized by Luxembourg international private law conflict of jurisdiction rules; - the judgment is final and enforceable (exécutoire) in the jurisdiction where the decision is rendered; - the U.S. court has applied the substantive law as designated by the Luxembourg conflict of laws rules or, at least, the order must not contravene the principles underlying those rules. Based on recent case law and legal doctrine, it is not certain that this condition would still be required for an exequatur to be granted by a Luxembourg court; - the U.S. court has acted in accordance with its own procedural laws; - the judgment must not have been obtained by fraud and must have been granted in compliance with the rights of the defendant and in compliance with its own procedural laws; and - the judgment does not contravene Luxembourg international public policy rules as understood under the laws of Luxembourg or has been given in proceedings of a criminal or tax nature or rendered subsequent to a violation of Luxembourg law (fraude à la loi). It cannot be excluded that awards of damages made under civil liabilities provisions of the U.S. federal securities laws, or other laws, which are classified by Luxembourg courts as being of a penal or punitive nature (for example, fines or punitive damages), would not be recognized by Luxembourg courts. Ordinarily an award of monetary damages would not be considered as a penalty, but if the monetary damages include punitive damages, such punitive damages may be considered as a penalty. We have also been advised by our Luxembourg counsel that if an original action is brought in Luxembourg, Luxembourg courts may refuse to apply the designated law amongst others and notably if its application contravenes Luxembourg public policy. In an action brought in Luxembourg on the basis of U.S. federal or state securities laws, Luxembourg courts may not have the requisite power to grant the remedies sought. 475 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: - identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control; - evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors; - conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern; F-4 ----- - evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; - obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.

These analyses also took into account the position statement published by the French accounting standards setter (Autorité des normes comptables – ANC) on July 3, 2020, which supersedes the previous statement dated February 16, 2018, to determine the IFRS 16 lease terms of “3/6/9”- type French commercial leases, notably those which have entered an automatic renewal period. On December 16, 2019, the IFRS IC published its decision in response to a request for clarification on the following matters: - determination of the enforceable period of an automatically renewable lease, or of an indefinite-term lease, that may be terminated by one of the parties subject to a specified notice period. The issue to be clarified concerned the notion of penalties on which the definition of the enforceable period is based; and - the relationship between the useful life of non-removable leasehold improvements and the lease term under IFRS 16. The IFRS IC: - concluded that the economics of a lease (rather than just the legal form) should be taken into account to determine the enforceable period of a lease; and - provided clarification on the relationship between the lease term under IFRS 16 and the useful life of non-removable leasehold improvements. Note that the Group did not apply this decision when preparing its March 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements or the June 30 and September 30, 2020 condensed consolidated interim financial statements. The impacts of this change in accounting policy were recognized retrospectively with effect from the IFRS 16 transition date (i.e., April 1, 2019), and the March 31, 2020 consolidated financial statements were recast accordingly. The impact of that application caused the Group to recognize an additional €104 million of right-of-use assets, with a balancing addition in an equivalent amount to lease liabilities. The application of this IFRS IC interpretation has led to: - an extension of the lease terms considered under IFRS 16 for almost 80% of the lease agreements. Indeed, most of the lease agreements of the Group have a 9-year term (with possible early termination by the Group every 3 years) and beyond 9 years the lessee and the lessor each has the right to terminate the lease without permission from the other party. Therefore, during the first time application of IFRS16, it was initially considered that the lease terms could not exceed 9 years, in accordance with the position statement published by the French accounting standards setter (Autorité des normes comptables – ANC) dated February 16, 2018, to determine the IFRS 16 lease terms of “3/6/9”- type French commercial leases. However, based on the IFRS IC interpretation, to determine the enforceable period of the lease, an entity should consider the broader economics of the contract, and not only contractual termination payments. For example, if either party has an economic incentive not to terminate the lease such that it would incur a penalty on termination that is more than insignificant, the contract is enforceable beyond the date on which the contract can be terminated. Therefore, the Group has reviewed the lease terms of its lease agreements to reflect the historical renewal of its lease agreements. These circumstances make reasonable to consider the renewal by 3-year period of the lease agreements over a period corresponding at least to the business plan horizon. - a reduction in the depreciation periods of non-removable leasehold improvements for all the underlying assets concerned. The depreciation periods have been reduced to be consistent with the duration of the leases reflected at the first-time adoption date (e.g. April 1, 2019), so that such improvements have either a value that is nil or immaterial at the end of the lease term, or a residual value that is covered by the benefits the Group would be entitled to receive in case of eviction or sale of the leasehold.

Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortized nor individually tested for impairment. The income statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. The share of result of the associate is shown on the face of the income statement on the line “Share of result in an associate”. This is the profit attributable to equity holders of the associate and therefore is profit after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associates. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company and using the same accounting policies. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies of the associate in line with those of the Group. After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an additional impairment loss on the Group’s investment in its associate. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired.

Amortization may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. If the hedge item is derecognized, the unamortized fair value is recognized immediately in the income statement. When an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognized in the income statement. As at March 31, 2020, the Group did not have any fair value hedging derivatives. _Cash flow hedges_ The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized directly in equity, while any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognized or when a forecast sale occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized in equity are transferred to the income statement.

If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

A similar positive impact has been observed in other countries, particularly in Belgium. The Group did not experience any significant store closures, sourcing issues or disruption in its supply chain during the period. This positive impact is notably explained by: - the attractiveness of frozen food in such period; - the closure of restaurants and out-of-home food services; and - the formats of Picard stores (convenience, proximity and, small size). - Cathy Collart-Geiger was appointed CEO of the Picard Group on June 15, 2020. - A tax audit of Picard Surgelés and Lion Polaris II was initiated by the French tax authorities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2020 on the interest rate applicable in respect of certain intercompany loans for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,100.222.1,Definition of a lease under IFRS 16,"Under IFRS 16, the assessment of whether or not a contract contains a lease, is based on whether or not the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. To assess whether a contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, the Group assesses whether: - the contract involves the use of an identified asset, which may be specified explicitly or implicitly, and should be physically distinct or represent substantially all of the capacity of a physically distinct asset. If the supplier has a substantive substitution right, then the asset is not identified; - the Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the asset throughout the period of use; and - the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset. The Group has this right when it has the decisionmaking rights that are most relevant to changing how and for what purpose the asset is used. In rare cases where the decision about how and for what purpose the asset is used is predetermined, the Group has the right to direct the use of the asset if either: - the Group has the right to operate the asset; or - the Group designed the asset in a way that predetermines how and for what purpose it will be used. At inception or on reassessment of a contract that contains a lease component, the Group allocates the consideration in the contract to each lease component based on their relative stand-alone prices and the aggregate stand-alone price of the non-lease components. However, for leases of land and buildings in respect of which it is a lessee, the Group has elected not to separate non-lease components and accounts for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The Group recognizes a right-of-use asset and a lease liability at the lease commencement date. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset or to restore the underlying asset or the site on which it is located, less any lease incentives received. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments that have not been paid at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease. The lease payments included in the valuation of the lease liability include: - fixed payments, including in -substance fixed payments; - variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, which are initially measured using the index or rate as at the commencement date; - amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee; and - the exercise price of a purchase option if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise that option, lease payments in an optional renewal period if the Group is reasonably certain to exercise an extension option, and penalties for early termination of a lease unless the Group is reasonably certain not to terminate early.

Business combinations and goodwill,"Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. For each business combination, the non-controlling interest in the acquired business is measured either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquired business’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in “Other operating expenses”. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquired business is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, is recognized in accordance with IAS 36 either in profit or loss or as a change to “Other comprehensive income”. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity. Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of (i) the consideration transferred and (ii) the fair value of non-controlling interest and the identifiable assets acquired net of liabilities assumed. If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units or group of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.

Investment in associate,"The Group’s investment in its associates is accounted for using the equity method. An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence. Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortized nor individually tested for impairment. The income statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. The share of result of the associate is shown on the face of the income statement on the line “Share of result in an associate”. This is the profit attributable to equity holders of the associate and therefore is profit after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associates. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company and using the same accounting policies. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies of the associate in line with those of the Group. After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an additional impairment loss on the Group’s investment in its associate. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If such is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the amount in the income statement.

Financial liabilities – initial recognition and subsequent measurement,"_Initial recognition and measurement_ The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. The Group has not designated any financial liabilities upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities within the scope of IFRS 9 – Financial instruments are classified as loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank overdraft, loans and borrowings, and derivative financial instruments. _Subsequent measurement_ The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows: _Loans and borrowings_ After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (EIR). Gains and losses are recognized in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR method amortization process. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in “Finance costs” in the income statement. _Derecognition_ A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the income statement through “Finance costs”.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements,100.222.10,,"The adoption of these policies had no significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements except for IFRS 16 as presented below. - **IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments On June 7, 2017, the IASB published its interpretation IFRIC 23, “Uncertainty over Tax Treatments.” The interpretation, adopted by the European Union on October 23, 2018, is applicable as from January 1, 2019. IFRIC 23 clarifies the application of IAS 12, “Income Tax,” with respect to recognition and valuation where uncertainty exists as to income tax treatment. The interpretation provides several clarifications, including with respect to: - the unit of account, meaning the level of tax risk at which the principles for recognition and valuation of the asset or liability should be applied: either grouped together (by tax entity, jurisdiction, or group), or at the level of each risk taken individually; - the detection risk, which must be taken fully into account in the recognition and valuation of tax risk. It should be assumed that the tax authorities will conduct an audit and that they will have access to all information needed to identify the error or incorrect interpretation of the tax standard. The principle of recognition relies on an estimate of the probability (in the sense of “more likely than not”) that the uncertain tax position will be acceptable. Thus, if it is more likely than not (probability of over 50%) that the tax authorities will not accept the company’s position with respect to tax treatment, the uncertain tax position must be reflected in the financial statements as income tax payable and/or deferred tax; and - the valuation principle concerning the provision, which relies on the estimate of the amount that the company expects to pay to or recover from the tax authorities. Two valuation methods may be used on a case by case basis: the most probable amount, or the expected value. An analysis was performed by the Group and did not reveal any significant impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements in relation to the application of this standard. - **IFRS 16 Leases IFRS 16 eliminates the requirement to classify leases as either operating leases or finance leases and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. The Group adopted IFRS 16 as of April 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective approach and therefore the comparative information has not been restated and continues to be reported under IAS 17 and IFRIC 4. The details of the changes in accounting policies are disclosed below, as well as in Note 7.4 (Finance Income and _Costs), Note 10 (Leases), Note 13.1 (Other current and non-current financial assets) and Note 13.3 (Other financial liabilities)._ Leases primarily relate to property assets (around 1,000 leases), including both stores and administrative buildings and to a lesser extent, vehicles. over the term of the lease. Lease incentives received were recognized as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term of the lease. - **Under new accounting policy – IFRS 16 (from April 1, 2019) The lease liability is measured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. It is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or rate, if there is a change in the Group’s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee, or if the Group changes its assessment of whether it will exercise a purchase, extension or termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured in this way, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. IFRS 16 requires separate presentation of the interest expense on the lease liabilities and the depreciation charge for the right-of-use asset in the lessee’s statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income. The interest expense on the lease liability is a component of finance costs. - Lease terms The Group has estimated the term of each of its lease agreements (i.e. the period during which it is reasonably certain to remain in the premises), taking into account the facts and circumstances that are specific to each lease agreement. This estimated lease term corresponds to: - the non-cancellable period subsequent to the valuation date; plus - the period covered by a lessee’s renewal option if such renewal is reasonably certain. A minor portion of the Group’s lease agreements have fixed terms. For those contracts, the estimated lease term corresponds to the end date of the current lease period. For all the other leases (with either exit options or renewal options at the election of the lessee), a detailed analysis was carried out to determine the estimated lease term. This analysis was based on the lease agreements, existing plans to renew, current negotiations or other agreements. The main criteria when assessing the reasonably certain term of a lease are (i) the specialized nature of the assets, (ii) the location of the assets and (iii) the maturity of the investments made. For stores, in most cases, the estimated term of the lease has been defined as the maximum period during which the contract is executory (for example the end of the last triennial period in case of commercial “3/6/9” leases in accordance with guidance issued by the “Autorité des Normes Comptables” in February 2018). However, in some cases, a shorter period has been retained, particularly for stores that are not profitable (excluding newly opened stores still in ramp-up period) or when a closure is already planned. At lease end, in the case of a tacit renewal of the lease, the Group also conducted an analysis to identify when the lease could be considered as contractually renewed. These assumptions are subject to change in accordance with the latest IFRIC positions (See Note 2.2-Significant _accounting judgments, estimates and assumptions)._ - Discount rate The Group determines the discount rate applicable to each lease agreement based on the incremental borrowing rate in each location and based on maturity. Therefore the calculation of the discount rate requires estimates, especially regarding the credit spread added to the risk free rate. The discount rates used correspond to bank rates that the Group would obtain in order to finance identical fixed assets. F-56 ----- - Short-term leases and leases of low value assets The Group has elected not to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases that have a term shorter than 12 months and for leases of assets valued at less than K$ 5, which mainly include IT equipment, mobile devices and car leases. The Group recognizes the lease payments associated with these leases as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. - **Impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements The Group has chosen to apply IFRS 16 using the simplified retrospective approach as from April 1, 2019. The Group’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended March 31, 2019 were not restated. As at April 1, 2019, the amount of lease liabilities represents the present value of lease payments due over the reasonably certain term of the lease. Applying IFRS 16 also impacts the following items in the consolidated financial statements: - leasehold rights are now included as part of the initial measurement of the right-of-use assets. Reclassifications were made in the opening balance sheet in this respect for M€ 47.1 ; - prepaid lease payments and lease incentives to be recognized over the lease term, which were initially shown in other assets and other liabilities, are now included in right-of-use assets; and - right-of-use assets have been derecognized and financial receivables recognized in respect of sub-letting arrangements granted over the residual period of the leases concerned. Recognition of these receivables had a positive impact of K€ 171 on financial assets. F-58 ----- The table below summarizes the impact of applying IFRS 16 on the opening balance sheet in the Group’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the twelve-month period ended March 31, 2020 : As at April 1, 2019, right-of-use assets relate to the following asset categories: An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in Note 12. Financial assets and financial liabilities. Depreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset as follows: - Buildings and building improvements 20 years - Operating equipment 5 to 10 years - Transportation equipment 4 years - Computers and hardware 3 to 5 years - Furniture 10 years An item of property, plant and equipment and any significant part initially recognized is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on derecognition of the asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset) is included in the income statement in the line item “Other operating expenses”. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. employees. Due to the complexity of the valuation, the underlying assumptions and its long term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. In determining the appropriate discount rate, management considers the interest rates of corporate bonds with high quality ratings, with extrapolated maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on a publicly available mortality table. Future salary increases and expected turnover rates of employees are based on the expectation of management and on past practices over recent years. Further details about the assumptions used are given in Note 23. Trade and other payables. _Deferred income tax_ Deferred tax assets are recognized for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits. The assessment of the Group’s ability to utilize tax losses carried forward is to a large extent judgment-based. If the future taxable results of the Group are significantly different from those expected, the Group will be obliged to increase or decrease the carrying amount of deferred tax assets, with a potentially material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Consolidated Income Statement of the Group. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss for the Group. Considering its activity, the Group is only exposed to limited credit risk from operating activities. Furthermore, the Group is not exposed to material credit risk from its financing activities (deposits with banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments) as investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties. The Group’s policy to manage this risk is to place funds only with banks that have strong credit ratings. Liquidity risk The Group monitors its exposure to a risk of shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans, debentures, and finance leases. 2.2 % of the Group’s interest bearing loans and borrowings mature less than one year after March 31, 2020, based on the carrying value of borrowings reflected in the financial statements. _Maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities_ The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments at the maturity date. _In thousands of €_ Primex International is a private entity incorporated in France that is not listed on any public exchange.

Minimum lease payments were the payments over the lease term that the lessee was required to make, excluding any contingent rent.

Right-of-use assets are measured at an amount equal to the lease liability (subject to certain adjustments detailed below). The Group applied this approach to all leases. The Group used some practical expedients when applying IFRS 16 to leases previously classified as operating leases under IAS 17. The Group: - applied a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics; - applied the exemption not to recognize right-of-use assets and liabilities for leases with less than 12 months of lease term and for leases of assets valued at less than K$ 5; - excluded initial direct costs from measuring the right-of-use asset at the date of initial application; and - used hindsight when determining the lease term if the contract contained options to extend or terminate the lease. - Leases previously classified as finance leases under IAS 17 For leases that were classified as finance leases under IAS 17, the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset and the lease liability at April 1, 2019 are determined at the carrying amount of the lease asset and lease liability under IAS 17 immediately before that date. - Leasehold rights previously classified as intangible assets Leasehold rights represent specific and additional legal rights in relation to the right-of-use of the property, which materialize, if necessary, at the end of the lease. In particular, such rights include the right to renew the lease under favorable conditions (e.g. capped rents) and the right to obtain an indemnity in the event the lessor refuses to renew the lease at the end of the contract. The duration and mode of consuming the economic benefits of leasehold rights are different from those of the rest of the right-of-use assets (which are consumed during the term of the contract). Under IFRS 16, leasehold rights are considered initial direct costs, i.e. incremental costs incurred to obtain a lease which would not have been incurred if the contract had not been concluded (IFRS 16.A). The Group chose to recognize leasehold rights as a component of right-of-use assets and therefore they are no longer recognized as a separate intangible asset (IFRS 16.24). Under the approach adopted by the Group, the residual value of the leasehold right corresponds to the amount initially paid. Leasehold rights are tested annually and an impairment is recognized if necessary. - **Income tax Deferred tax is recognized based on the net amount of temporary taxable and deductible differences. Upon initial recognition of the right-of-use asset and lease liability, no deferred tax is recognized if the amount of the asset equals the amount of the liability. Net temporary differences that may result from subsequent changes in the right-of-use asset and lease liability give rise to the recognition of deferred tax. F-57 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

Business combinations and goodwill,"Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. For each business combination, the non-controlling interest in the acquired business is measured either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquired business’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in “Other operating expenses”. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquired business is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, is recognized in accordance with IAS 36 either in profit or loss or as a change to “Other comprehensive income”. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity. Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of (i) the consideration transferred and (ii) the fair value of non-controlling interest and the identifiable assets acquired net of liabilities assumed. If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units or group of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Under the definition of IAS 36, the Group identified cash-generating units, and group of cash-generating units, which are defined in Note 2.2.

Impairment of non-financial assets,100.258.1,,"_Cash-generating units (CGU)_ A cash-generating unit is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups of assets. The cash-generating unit is defined by management as the store level, with two main groups of cash-generating units, based on geographical implantation in: - France, and - Other. The “Other” operating segment includes distribution activities in Belgium, Luxembourg, and Sweden, franchised operations and partnerships in Italy, Switzerland, UK, Netherlands and Japan as well as our holding company operations (other than Group financing and income taxes) in Luxembourg. _Impairment analysis_ The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the groups of cash-generating units to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. For assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite useful life intangible assets (trademark), an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or cashgenerating unit’s recoverable amount. _Goodwill_ Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at year end and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit or group of cash-generating units is less than their carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. _Other intangible assets_ Other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (including mainly brand and leasehold rights) are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit or group of cash-generating units level, as appropriate and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired.

In this context, our Picard stores remained open and operated throughout the crisis period, being designated as essential stores. The COVID 19 crisis therefore had a positive impact on the turnover and operational results of Picard Surgelés, especially during the lockdown period which extended from March 17 to May 11, 2020 in France. A similar impact has been observed in other countries, particularly in Belgium. Finally, Picard Surgelés communicated at the end of March its decision to pay an exceptional bonus to employees. - On January 23, 2020, ARYZTA AG advised that it had completed the disposal of a 43% shareholding in Picard to Invest Group Zouari (‘IGZ’). ARYZTA retains a 4.5% shareholding in Picard and Lion Capital remains the majority shareholder of the Group. - A tax audit of Picard Surgelés and Lion Polaris II is currently being conducted by the French tax authorities with respect to the interest rate applicable in respect of certain intercompany loans for the years 2016, 2017 and 2018. In order to avoid the statute of limitations for the year 2016, the tax administration sent an assessment notice concerning Lion Polaris II before December 31, 2019. The Group believes it has strong arguments to support its positions and has sent an answer to the assessment notice. As the tax audit is still in progress, no provision has been recorded.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: - Cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. - Long-term fixed-rate and variable-rate receivables are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates, specific country risk factors, and individual creditworthiness of the customer and the risk characteristics of the financed project. Based on this evaluation, provision allowances are taken into account for the expected losses relating to these receivables. As at March 31, 2020, the carrying amounts of such receivables, net of provision allowances, approximated their fair values. - Fair value of quoted notes and bonds is based on price quotations at the reporting date. The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial indebtedness, obligations under finance leases as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt or similar terms and remaining maturities. Because of the lack of similar transactions due to the current economic context, credit spreads of fixed rate borrowings have been considered to be equal to the credit spread applied at the inception of the debt. - From time to time, the Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The calculation of fair value for derivative financial instruments depends on the type of instruments: Derivative interest rate contracts – The fair value of derivative interest rate contracts (e.g., interest rate swap agreements) are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curve over the remaining term of the instrument.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 7.25% (compared to 7.25% the prior year) and cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a 1.75% growth rate (compared to 1.75% the prior year). As a result of this analysis, no impairment has been recognized by the Group. _Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_ With regard to the assessment of value-in-use of goodwill and the brand, the Group estimates that an increase in the discount rate by 50 basis points or a decrease by 50 basis points in the growth rate would not cause the carrying value of the above cash-generating units to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

Business combinations and goodwill,"Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair value of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred to the former owners of the acquired business and the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. For each business combination, the non-controlling interest in the acquired business is measured either at fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquired business’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and included in “Other operating expenses”. If the business combination is achieved in stages, the acquisition date carrying value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquired business is remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date through profit or loss. Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the Group is recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, is recognized in accordance with IAS 36 either in profit or loss or as a change to “Other comprehensive income”. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, it is not remeasured until it is finally settled within equity. Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of (i) the consideration transferred and (ii) the fair value of non-controlling interest and the identifiable assets acquired net of liabilities assumed. If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units or group of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Under the definition of IAS 36, the Group identified cash-generating units, and group of cash-generating units, which are defined in Note 2.2.

Investment in associate,"The Group’s investment in its associates is accounted for using the equity method. An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence. Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortized nor individually tested for impairment. The income statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. The share of profit of the associate is shown on the face of the income statement on the line “Share of profit in an associate”. This is the profit attributable to equity holders of the associate and therefore is profit after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associates. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company and using the same accounting policies. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies of the associate in line with those of the Group. After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an additional impairment loss on the Group’s investment in its associate. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If such is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the amount in the income statement.

The Group has not designated any financial liabilities upon initial recognition as at fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities within the scope of IFRS 9 – Financial instruments are classified as loans and borrowings, or as derivatives designated as hedging instruments in an effective hedge, as appropriate. All financial liabilities are recognized initially at fair value and in the case of loans and borrowings, net of directly attributable transaction costs. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank overdraft, loans and borrowings, and derivative financial instruments. _Subsequent measurement_ The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows: Loans and borrowings After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings are measured at amortized cost using the effective interest rate method (EIR). Gains and losses are recognized in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognized as well as through the EIR method amortization process. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in “Finance costs” in the income statement. Derecognition A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged, cancelled or expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the income statement through “Finance costs”. _Fair value of financial instruments_ The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is determined at each reporting date by reference to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations (bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions), without any deduction for transaction costs. For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in Note 12.

Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognized at fair value on the date on which the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value.

Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives are recognized in the income statement, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. For the purpose of hedge accounting, those derivatives that meet the criteria of hedge effectiveness are classified as cash flow hedges. Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: _Fair value hedges_ The change in the fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized in the income statement. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as a part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized in the income statement. For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortized cost, the adjustment to carrying value is amortized through the income statement over the remaining term to maturity. Amortization may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. If the hedge item is derecognized, the unamortized fair value is recognized immediately in the income statement. When an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognized in the income statement.

The Group will apply IFRS 16 from April 1, 2019, and expects to apply this standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initial application recognized as at April 1, 2019. IFRS 16 eliminates the requirement to classify leases as either operating leases or finance leases and, instead, introduces a single lessee accounting model. Under IFRS 16, all leases are to be brought onto the statement of financial position by recognizing a right-of-use asset and a lease liability corresponding to the present value of the lease payments due over the reasonably certain term of the lease. IFRS 16 will therefore affect the presentation of lease transactions in the income statement (with rental expense replaced by a depreciation expense and interest expense) and in the statement of cash flows (lease payments, representing payment of interest and repayment of the outstanding liability, will impact financing cash flows). The Group has opted to apply the two exemptions proposed in the standard, concerning leases for which the underlying asset is of low value and short-term leases (for periods of 12 months or less). Leases concern: - property assets for the most part (around 1,000 leases), including both stores and administrative buildings; and - vehicles to a lesser extent. On the IFRS 16 transition date, lease liabilities will be measured using the lessee’s incremental borrowing rate. In parallel, the Group has finalized implementation of a computer application to calculate and generate the data needed to account for leases in accordance with IFRS 16. A preliminary assessment of the impact of this standard has been performed by the Group (including leases identification and collection, impact modelling and development of a dedicated tool). Based on this preliminary assessment, the Group estimated that the liabilities of the Group as at March 31, 2019 would have increased by an amount within a range of €257 million to €267 million. The difference between the financial liability estimated under IFRS 16 and the future minimum lease commitments reported above is primarily due to the effect of discounting future lease payments, which reduces the reported commitment, and an increase in the terms of the leases under consideration. The Group applies right-of use equal to lease liability, adjusted by the amount of any prepaid or accrued lease payments relating to that lease recognized in the statement of financial position immediately before the date of initial application. The new or amended standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the European Union are as follows: - IFRS 3 – Definition of a Business (applicable according to the IASB in annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021) ; - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020); - IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts (applicable according to the IASB in annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021) ; - IAS1 and IAS 8 – Definition of Material (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020); The impact of all these standards not yet adopted by the European Union on the Group’s results and financial situation is currently being evaluated. The defined benefit asset or liability comprises the present value of the defined benefit obligation (using a discount rate based on high quality corporate bonds, as explained in Note 21. Employee benefits). The defined benefit expense is recognized through “Personnel expenses” (under pension costs) for the service cost component of the expense and through “Finance costs” (under interest costs of employee benefits) for the interest cost component. remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as financial assets when the fair value is positive and as financial liabilities when the fair value is negative. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value on derivatives are recognized in the income statement, except for the effective portion of cash flow hedges, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. For the purpose of hedge accounting, those derivatives that meet the criteria of hedge effectiveness are classified as cash flow hedges. Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows: _Fair value hedges_ The change in the fair value of a hedging derivative is recognized in the income statement. The change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to the risk hedged is recorded as a part of the carrying value of the hedged item and is also recognized in the income statement. For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortized cost, the adjustment to carrying value is amortized through the income statement over the remaining term to maturity. Amortization may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. If the hedge item is derecognized, the unamortized fair value is recognized immediately in the income statement. When an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognized in the income statement. As at March 31, 2019, the Group did not have any fair value hedging derivatives. _Cash flow hedges_ The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized directly in equity, while any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognized or when a forecast sale occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized in equity are transferred to the income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognized in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction or firm commitment occurs. The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end, and adjusted prospectively, if appropriate. An inventory impairment is recorded in the following cases: - 50%: on frozen (and not frozen) products permanently deleted from the catalog but which are disposed of in the stores; - 75%: on products whose inventory quantities are higher than the sales forecasts in the expected time-to-market (Group decision); - 75%: on products likely to be impaired due to the regulations of sales period; and - 100%: on unmarketable products definitively deleted from the catalog. generating unit or group of cash-generating units is less than their carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (including mainly brand and leasehold rights) are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit or group of cash-generating units level, as appropriate and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Credit risk Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty will not meet its obligations under a financial instrument or customer contract, leading to a financial loss for the Group. Considering its activity, the Group is only exposed to limited credit risk from operating activities. Furthermore, the Group is not exposed to material credit risk from its financing activities (deposits with banks and financial institutions and other financial instruments) as investments of surplus funds are made only with approved counterparties. The Group’s policy to manage this risk is to place funds only with banks that have strong credit ratings. Liquidity risk The Group monitors its exposure to a risk of shortage of funds using a recurring liquidity planning tool. The Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of bank overdrafts, bank loans, debentures, and finance leases. 0.3 % of the Group’s interest bearing loans and borrowings mature less than one year after March 31, 2019, based on the carrying value of borrowings reflected in the financial statements. _Maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities_ The table below summarizes the maturity profile of the Group’s financial liabilities based on contractual undiscounted payments at the maturity date. _In thousands of €_ - On 29 March 2019, Lion Polaris Lux 3 SA was merged into Lion Polaris Lux Midco Sarl, with Lion Polaris Midco being the surviving entity. the write-off of the non-amortized issuance fees (K€ 8,556) and the early redemption premium on the senior notes issued in 2015 (K€ 16,585). As at March 31, 2019, the Group no longer has an interest rate swap For the financial year ended March 31, 2019, deferred tax includes an income of K€ 10,255 relating to the recognition of deferred tax assets on non-deductible interests from previous periods. In accordance with thincapitalization rules, interests in an amount of €35 million were not deducted from previous tax results but were carried-forward. These unused tax credits were not recognized as deferred tax assets considering uncertainties on the horizon under which this deductible temporary difference could be utilized. However, following the change in the structure of the financing in December 2017, the Group believes it will now be able to deduct these interests from its future tax results and therefore recognized the corresponding deferred tax assets. Excluding this impact, income tax expense of March 31, 2019 would have been K€ 45,025. A reconciliation between tax expense and accounting profit (based on France’s domestic tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2019, France being the country where most of the taxable income is generated) is as follows: due 2023 on May 14, 2018. These floating rate senior secured notes are payable after 6 years on November 30, 2023. Interest is paid quarterly based on a variable interest rate fixed in reference to a market rate (3-month Euribor, subject to a 0% floor) increased by a margin of 3% per annum. The floating rate senior secured notes are refundable “in fine”. - The Company issued M€310 of fixed rate senior notes due 2024. These senior notes are payable after 7 years on November 30, 2024, and interest is paid twice a year based on a fixed interest rate of 5.50%. The senior notes are refundable “in fine”. instruments depends on the type of instruments: Derivative interest rate contracts – The fair value of derivative interest rate contracts (e.g., interest rate swap agreements) are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curve over the remaining term of the instrument. In addition, in order to maintain or adjust its capital structure, the Group may be prompted to take out new debt or repay existing debt, adjust the amount of its dividends paid to shareholders, conduct a capital repayment to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets in order to reduce debt levels. During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2019 Picard Bondco S.A. distributed M€ 77 to its shareholders by way of payment of a dividend of M€ 76.9 (See Note 18. Dividends paid) and share premium repayment of M€ 0.1. The following tables summarize the components of net benefit expense recognized in the income statement and the unfunded status and amounts recognized in the statement of financial position for these plans: In thousand of €_ **As at March 31, 2019** **As at March 31, 2018 Current service cost 593 480 Interest cost 112 101 Benefit paid (176) (104) The principal assumptions used in determining defined benefit obligation for the French retirement indemnities plan are shown below: In thousand of €_ **As at March 31, 2019** **As at March 31, 2018 Discount rate 1,30% 1,38% Average expected rate of salary increase 1,50% 1,40% Withdrawal rates [0% – 31.9%] [0% – 31.9%] A single equivalent discount rate has been calculated using a cash flows matching method on future cash flows. For the French retirement indemnities plan, a decrease of 0.25% of the discount rate would increase the defined benefit obligation by approximately K€ 437. An increase of 0.25% of the discount rate would decrease the defined benefit obligation by approximately K€ 299. The amounts disclosed in the table are the amounts recognized as an expense during the reporting period related to key management personnel (amount relates to short term benefits). The new or amended standards and interpretations adopted by the European Union are as follows: - IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments and amendments to IFRS 9, IFRS 7 and IAS 39 – Hedge Accounting (applicable according to the IASB in annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018); - IFRS 15 – Revenues from Contracts with Customers and the Clarifications to IFRS 15 published in April 2016 (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018); - IFRS 16 – Leases (applicable according to the IASB in annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019); - Amendments to IFRS4 – Applying IFRS9 Financial Instruments with IFRS4 Insurance Contracts (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018); - Amendments to IAS 40 – Transfers of Investment Property (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018); - IFRS 9 : Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019); - IFRIC 15 : Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after December 31, 2019); - IFRIC 22 – Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018); - Clarifications to IFRS 15 – Applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018; and - Annual Improvements to IFRS – Cycle 2014-2016 (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018); The new or amended standards and interpretations not yet adopted by the European Union are as follows: - IFRS 17 – Insurance Contracts (applicable according to the IASB in annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021) ; - Amendments to IFRS 2 – Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment Transactions (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018); - IAS 28 : Long-term Interests in Associates and Joint Ventures (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019); - Improvements to IFRSs 2015-2017 Cycle (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019); - IAS 19 : Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019); - IFRIC 23 – Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019); and - Amendments to References to the Conceptual Framework in IFRS Standards (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2020) Under the equity method, the investment in the associate is carried in the statement of financial position at cost plus post acquisition changes in the Group’s share of net assets of the associate. Goodwill relating to the associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortized nor individually tested for impairment. The income statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations of the associate. Unrealized gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to the extent of the Group’s interest in the associate. The share of profit of the associate is shown on the face of the income statement on the line “Share of profit in an associate”. This is the profit attributable to equity holders of the associate and therefore is profit after tax and non-controlling interests in the subsidiaries of the associates. The financial statements of the associate are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company and using the same accounting policies. Where necessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies of the associate in line with those of the Group. After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognize an additional impairment loss on the Group’s investment in its associate. The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If such is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognizes the amount in the income statement. _Deferred income tax_ Deferred taxes are determined using the liability method on temporary differences at the reporting date between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognized for all deductible temporary differences, carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except for specific conditions (initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination that affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year in which the asset is realized or the liability settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred taxes relating to items recognized outside profit or loss are recognized outside profit or loss. Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to offset current tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the same taxation authority. Amortized cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. The EIR amortization is included in “Finance costs” in the income statement. Derecognition A financial liability is derecognized when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expired. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognized in the income statement through “Finance costs”. _Fair value of financial instruments_ The fair value of financial instruments that are traded in active markets is determined at each reporting date by reference to quoted market prices or dealer price quotations (bid price for long positions and ask price for short positions), without any deduction for transaction costs. For financial instruments not traded in an active market, the fair value is determined using appropriate valuation techniques. Such techniques may include using recent arm’s length market transactions, reference to the current fair value of another instrument that is substantially the same, discounted cash flow analysis or other valuation models. An analysis of fair values of financial instruments and further details as to how they are measured are provided in Note 12. Financial assets and financial liabilities. _Cash flow hedges_ The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized directly in equity, while any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognized or when a forecast sale occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized in equity are transferred to the income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognized in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction or firm commitment occurs. Trademarks which are not amortized are tested for impairment annually and upon each indication that they may be impaired. The useful lives of trademarks have been defined according to their strategic market position (for instance, a strong international trademark will be deemed to have an indefinite useful life). As at March 31, 2018, the trademark recognized corresponds to the Picard brand. _Leasehold rights_ Leasehold rights are constituted by sums paid to the owners of the leasehold (the former tenants) at the opening of new stores. Gross values recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position are stated at cost. Because of the legal protection attached to leasehold rights in France, the Group does not amortize these intangible assets. Leasehold rights which are not amortized are tested for impairment annually and upon each indication that it may be impaired. _Software_ Software acquired by the Group is booked as an intangible asset at its original cost. It is depreciated following the straight-line method over a maximum period of 3 years. Software developed by the Group for its internal use is recorded as an intangible asset at its development cost and is depreciated following the straight-line method over a maximum period of 3 years. _Impairment analysis_ The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists, or when annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group estimates the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the groups of cash-generating units to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. For assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite useful life intangible assets (trademark), an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or cashgenerating unit’s recoverable amount. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at year end and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit or group of cash-generating units is less than their carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. Other intangible assets Other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (brand and leasehold rights) are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit or group of cash-generating units level, as appropriate and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. requires the separate presentation of assets held for sale in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at the lower of net carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell, where the criteria set-out in the standard are satisfied. Should an unrealized loss be recorded, it is not deductible for tax purposes. When the Group is committed to a sales process leading to the loss of control of a subsidiary, all assets and liabilities of that subsidiary are reclassified as held for sale where the standard classification criteria are met, irrespective of whether the Group retains a residual interest in the entity after sale. The assessment of the Group’s ability to utilize tax losses carried forward is to a large extent judgment-based. If the future taxable results of the Group are significantly different from those expected, the Group will be obliged to increase or decrease the carrying amount of deferred tax assets, with a potentially material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Consolidated Income Statement of the Group. _In thousands of €_ For the year ended on March 31, 2018, social security costs include income of K€ 6 748 (compared to income of K€ 6 093 as of March 31, 2017) corresponding to the CICE (Crédit d’Impôt Compétitivité Emploi) in effect in France since January 1, 2013. 2009 to March 31, 2012. The Italian tax authorities appealed the decisions regarding the years ended March 31, 2009 and March 31, 2010, but the Regional Commission confirmed the decisions of the court of Varese in June 2016.

An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s (CGU) fair value less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the groups of cash-generating units to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. For assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite useful life intangible assets (trademark), an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or cashgenerating unit’s recoverable amount. Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at year end and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash F-104 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The total consideration received by Picard Group was K€ 100. As part of the transaction, a five-year commercial cooperation agreement has been signed between Picard Group and the buyer of the Swedish operations in order to: - grant the use of the brand name of Picard in Sweden; and - define the selling conditions for certain Picard products to the buyer. Pursuant to that agreement, the buyer will continue the development of the business in Sweden through various channels, including the contract with ICA and franchised stores, while the Group will supply Picard-branded products to the buyer for such purposes. Following the disposal of Picard Sweden, the Group recognized additional charges of M€ 3.0, corresponding mainly to the derecognition of the non-controlling interests. - On August 21, 2018, the Picard Group obtained a tax refund in respect of the fish tax in an amount of M€ 3.9 which was recognized as “Other operating income” in the financial statements for the financial year ended March 31, 2019.

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: - Cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. - Long-term fixed-rate and variable-rate receivables are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates, specific country risk factors, and individual creditworthiness of the customer and the risk characteristics of the financed project. Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken into account for the expected losses of these receivables. As at March 31, 2019, the carrying amounts of such receivables, net of allowances, approximate their fair values. - Fair value of quoted notes and bonds is based on price quotations at the reporting date. The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial indebtedness, obligations under finance leases as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt or similar terms and remaining maturities. Because of the lack of similar transactions due to the current economic context, credit spreads of fixed rate borrowings have been considered to be equal to the credit spread applied at the inception of the debt. - The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings.

The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 7.25% (compared to 7.25% the prior year) and cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a 1.75% growth rate (compared to 1.75% the prior year). As a result of this analysis, no impairment has been recognized by the Group. _Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_ With regard to the assessment of value-in-use of goodwill and the brand, the Group estimates that an increase in the discount rate by 50 basis points or a decrease by 50 basis points in the growth rate would not cause the carrying value of the above cash-generating units to materially exceed its recoverable amount. Reasonable changes in assumptions defined by the management should not cause the CGU’s carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount. F-115 -----",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

357,Offerings 2021.md,100,NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,100.534,Picard Bondco Report on the audit of the consolidated financial statements,100.534.1,What we have audited,"The Group’s consolidated financial statements comprise: - the consolidated statement of financial position as at 31 March 2018; - the consolidated income statement for the year then ended; - the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended; - the consolidated statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; - the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year then ended; and - the notes to the consolidated financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies. _Basis for opinion_ We conducted our audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 on the audit profession (Law of 23 July 2016) and with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) as adopted for Luxembourg by the “Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier” (CSSF). Our responsibilities under those Law and standards are further described in the “Responsibilities of the “Réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements” section of our report. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the consolidated financial statements. We have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities under those ethical requirements. _Other information_ The Board of Directors is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information stated in the Directors’ report but does not include the consolidated financial statements and our audit report thereon. Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. _PricewaterhouseCoopers, Société coopérative, 2 rue Gerhard Mercator, B.P. 1443, L-1014 Luxembourg T : +352 494848 1, F : +352 494848 2900, www.pwc.lu Cabinet de révision agréé. Expert-comptable (autorisation gouvernementale n°10028256) R.C.S. Luxembourg B 65 477 - TVA LU25482518_ F-123 ----- In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard. _Responsibilities of the Board of Directors for the consolidated financial statements_ The Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and for such internal control as the Board of Directors determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. _Responsibilities of the “Réviseur d’entreprises agréé” for the audit of the consolidated financial statements_ The objectives of our audit are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an audit report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements. As part of an audit in accordance with the Law of 23 July 2016 and with ISAs as adopted for Luxembourg by the CSSF, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: - identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control; - obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control; - evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the Board of Directors; - conclude on the appropriateness of the Board of Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our audit report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our audit report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern; - evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation; F-124 ----- - obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities and business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the Group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion. We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values: - Cash and short-term deposits, trade receivables, trade payables, and other current liabilities approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short-term maturities of these instruments. - Long-term fixed-rate and variable-rate receivables are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates, specific country risk factors, and individual creditworthiness of the customer and the risk characteristics of the financed project. Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken into account for the expected losses of these receivables. As at March 31, 2018, the carrying amounts of such receivables, net of allowances, approximate their fair values. - Fair value of quoted notes and bonds is based on price quotations at the reporting date. The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial indebtedness, obligations under finance leases as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt or similar terms and remaining maturities. Because of the lack of similar transactions due to the current economic context, credit spreads of fixed rate borrowings have been considered to be equal to the credit spread applied at the inception of the debt. - The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The calculation of fair value for derivative financial instruments depends on the type of instruments: Derivative interest rate contracts – The fair value of derivative interest rate contracts (e.g., interest rate swap agreements) are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curve over the remaining term of the instrument.",N/A,as_expected,2021,662

The discount rate applied to cash flow projections is 7.25% (compared to 7.25% the prior year) and cash flows beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a 1.75% growth rate (compared to 2% the prior year). As a result of this analysis, no impairment has been recognized by the Group. _Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_ With regard to the assessment of value-in-use of goodwill and the brand, the Group estimates that an increase in the discount rate by 50 basis points or a decrease by 50 basis points in the growth rate would not cause the carrying value of the above cash-generating units to materially exceed its recoverable amount.

The table below summarizes the impact of applying IFRS 16 and the IFRS IC interpretation relating to IFRS 16 on the first-time application as at April 1, 2019: The impact on the closing consolidated income statement for the year ended March 31, 2020 is presented below: The impact on the consolidated cash-flow statement for the year ended March 31, 2020 is presented below: - Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IFRS Practice Statement 2: Disclosure of Accounting policies (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023); - Amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022); - Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022); - Amendments to IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022); - Amendments to Annual Improvements 2018-2020 (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2022); - Amendments to IFRS 17 Insurance contracts (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023); - Amendments to IAS 8 Accounting policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors: Definition of Accounting Estimates (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023); - Amendments to IFRS 16 Leases: Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions beyond 30 June 2021 (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023); - Amendments to IAS 12 Income Taxes: Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023); - Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021); and - Amendments to IFRS 4 Deferral of IFRS 9 (applicable according to the IASB in accounting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021). The impact of these standards on the Group’s results and financial situation is currently being evaluated and is not expected to be material. Goodwill is initially measured at cost being the excess of the aggregate of (i) the consideration transferred and (ii) the fair value of non-controlling interest and the identifiable assets acquired net of liabilities assumed. If the consideration is lower than the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference is recognized in profit or loss. After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units or group of cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units. Under the definition of IAS 36, the Group identified cash-generating units, and group of cash-generating units, which are defined in Note 2.2. Summary of significant accounting policies. The Group’s financial liabilities include trade and other payables, bank overdraft, loans and borrowings, and derivative financial instruments. For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortized cost, the adjustment to carrying value is amortized through the income statement over the remaining term to maturity. Amortization may begin as soon as an adjustment exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. If the hedge item is derecognized, the unamortized fair value is recognized immediately in the income statement. When an unrecognized firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognized as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain or loss recognized in the income statement. As at March 31, 2021, the Group did not have any fair value hedging derivatives. _Cash flow hedges_ The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognized directly in equity, while any ineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financial income or financial expense is recognized or when a forecast sale occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If the forecast transaction or firm commitment is no longer expected to occur, amounts previously recognized in equity are transferred to the income statement. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts previously recognized in equity remain in equity until the forecast transaction or firm commitment occurs. The useful lives of trademarks have been defined according to their strategic market position (for instance, a strong international trademark will be deemed to have an indefinite useful life). As at March 31, 2021, the trademark recognized corresponds to the Picard brand. _Software_ Software acquired by the Group is booked as an intangible asset at its original cost. It is depreciated following the straight-line method over a maximum period of 3 to 10 years. Software developed by the Group for its internal use is recorded as an intangible asset at its development cost and is depreciated following the straight-line method over a maximum period of 3 years. The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets and forecast calculations which are prepared separately for each of the groups of cash-generating units to which the individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecast calculations generally cover a period of five years. For longer periods, a long term growth rate is calculated and applied to project future cash flows after the fifth year. In determining fair value less costs to sell, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no such transactions can be identified, an appropriate valuation model is used. For assets excluding goodwill and other indefinite useful life intangible assets (trademark), an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication that previously recognized impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset’s or cashgenerating unit’s recoverable amount. _Goodwill_ Goodwill is tested for impairment annually at year end and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit or group of cash-generating units to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cashgenerating unit or group of cash-generating units is less than their carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized. Impairment losses relating to goodwill cannot be reversed in future periods. _Other intangible assets_ Other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives (including mainly brand and leasehold rights) are tested for impairment annually either individually or at the cash generating unit or group of cash-generating units level, as appropriate and when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. estimates and assumptions on a regular basis to ensure that they are appropriate based on past experience and current economic condition. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods. The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimating uncertainty at the reporting date that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are discussed below. _Impairment of non-financial assets_ An impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding sales transactions in an arm’s length transaction of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing of the asset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model. The cash flows are derived from the budget. The recoverable amount is mostly sensitive to the discount rate used for the discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash-inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolation purposes. Further details about assumptions and sensitivity of valuations are disclosed in Note 14. Impairment test of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. _Employee benefits liabilities_ The cost of defined benefit pension plans and the present value of pension obligations are determined using actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions. These include the determination of the discount rate, future salary increases, mortality rates and future withdrawal rates of employees. Due to the complexity of the valuation, the underlying assumptions and its long term nature, a defined benefit obligation is highly sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date. In determining the appropriate discount rate, management considers the interest rates of corporate bonds with high quality ratings, with extrapolated maturities corresponding to the expected duration of the defined benefit obligation. The mortality rate is based on a publicly available mortality table. Future salary increases and expected turnover rates of employees are based on the expectation of management and on past practices over recent years. Further details about the assumptions used are given in Note 23. Trade and other payables. _Deferred income tax_ Deferred tax assets are recognized for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the losses can be utilized. Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognized, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits. The assessment of the Group’s ability to utilize tax losses carried forward is to a large extent judgment-based. If the future taxable results of the Group are significantly different from those expected, the Group will be obliged to increase or decrease the carrying amount of deferred tax assets, with a potentially material impact on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and Consolidated Income Statement of the Group. The Group is exposed to market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s senior management oversees the management of these risks. The board of directors of the Company reviews and agrees policies for managing each of these risks which are summarized below. It is the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives for speculative purposes shall be undertaken. Market risk Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market prices. Financial instruments affected by market risk include loans and borrowings (including listed bonds), deposits, and derivative financial instruments. Interest rate risk Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to the Group’s long-term debt obligations with floating interest rates. Below is presented the sensitivity to interest rate variation: _In thousands of €_ into account for the expected losses relating to these receivables. As at March 31, 2021, the carrying amounts of such receivables, net of provision allowances, approximated their fair values. - Fair value of quoted notes and bonds is based on price quotations at the reporting date. The fair value of unquoted instruments, loans from banks and other financial indebtedness, obligations under finance leases as well as other non-current financial liabilities is estimated by discounting future cash flows using rates currently available for debt or similar terms and remaining maturities. Because of the lack of similar transactions due to the current economic context, credit spreads of fixed rate borrowings have been considered to be equal to the credit spread applied at the inception of the debt. - From time to time, the Group enters into derivative financial instruments with various counterparties, principally financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The calculation of fair value for derivative financial instruments depends on the type of instruments: Derivative interest rate contracts – The fair value of derivative interest rate contracts (e.g., interest rate swap agreements) are estimated by discounting expected future cash flows using current market interest rates and yield curve over the remaining term of the instrument. Terminal value was computed as the sum of discounted normative cash flows to perpetuity, through a Gordon Shapiro method factoring the discount rate and long-term growth rate assumptions detailed below. _Key assumptions used in the determination of the value in use_ The calculation of value-in-use was mostly sensitive to the following assumptions: - Discount rate; and - Long-term growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the budget period. The discount rate applied to cash flow projections was 7.25% (compared to 7.25% the prior year) and cash flows beyond the five-year period were extrapolated using a 1.75% long-term growth rate (compared to 1.75% the prior year). As a result of this analysis, no impairment has been recognized by the Group. _Sensitivity to changes in assumptions_ With regards to the assessment of value-in-use of the goodwill and brand, the Group estimated that a 50 bps increase in the discount rate or a 50 bps decrease in the long-term growth rate would not cause the carrying value of the above cash-generating units to materially exceed its recoverable amount. Similarly, a 50 bps decrease in the normative EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin would have no impact on the result of the tests. The benefit obligation and the experience actuarial gains (losses) are as follows: In thousand of €_ **As at March 31, 2021 The following loans have been entered with related parties:",N/A,as_expected,2021,662
