The CSSF assumes no responsibility with regards to the economic and financial soundness of any transaction under the Programme or the quality and solvency of the Issuer in accordance with the provisions of article 7(7) of the Luxembourg Act dated 10 July 2005 relating to prospectuses for securities (loi relative aux prospectus pour valeurs mobilières). Applications have been made for such Notes to be admitted during the period of twelve months after the date hereof to listing on the official list and to trading on the regulated market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. The Programme also permits Notes to be issued on the basis that they will not be admitted to listing, trading and/or quotation by any competent authority, stock exchange and/or quotation system or to be admitted to listing, trading and/or quotation by such other or further competent authorities, stock exchanges and/or quotation systems as may be agreed with TDC A/S (the ""Issuer"" or ""TDC""). Tranches of Notes (as defined herein) may be rated or unrated. Where a Tranche of Notes is rated, such rating will not necessarily be the same as the ratings described below or the rating(s) assigned to Notes already issued. Where a Tranche of Notes is rated, the applicable rating(s) will be specified in the relevant Final Terms (as defined herein). Whether or not each credit rating applied for in relation to a relevant Tranche of Notes will be (1) issued by a credit rating agency established in the EEA and registered (or which has applied for registration and not been refused) under Regulation (EU) No 1060/2009, as amended (the ""CRA Regulation"") or (2) issued by a credit rating agency which is not established in the EEA but will be endorsed by a credit rating agency which is established in the EEA and registered under the CRA Regulation or (3) issued by a credit rating agency which is not established in the EEA but which is certified under the CRA Regulation will be disclosed in the Final Terms. In general, European regulated investors are restricted from using a rating for regulatory purposes if such rating is not issued by a credit rating agency established in the EEA and registered under the CRA Regulation unless (1) the rating is provided by a credit rating agency operating in the EEA before 7 June 2010 which has submitted an application for registration in accordance with the CRA Regulation and such registration has not been refused, or (2) the rating is provided by a credit rating agency not established in the EEA but is endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the EEA and registered under the CRA Regulation or (3) the rating is provided by a credit rating agency not established in the EEA which is certified under the CRA Regulation. A rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold Notes and may be subject to suspension, change or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. The Notes may be issued on a continuing basis to one or more of the Dealers specified under ""Overview"", and any additional Dealer appointed under the Programme from time to time by the Issuer (each a ""Dealer"" and together the ""Dealers""), which appointment may be for a specific issue or on an ongoing basis. References in this Base Prospectus to the ""Relevant Dealer"" shall, in the case of an issue of Notes being (or intended to be) subscribed by more than one Dealer, be to all Dealers agreeing to subscribe to such Notes. _Investing in Notes issued under the Programme involves certain risks.

Also, more consumers may prioritise cost over convenience and choose individual suppliers for each communication need where the price is lower, rather than a bundled product, which may influence the demand for bundled products such as TDC HomeTrio. More businesses may go bankrupt, while the remaining business customers may reduce their investment levels, which may shrink the telecommunications market and thus reduce the contract volume and increase the risk of incurring losses due to bad debts. Decreased demand in the other Nordic countries, especially in Sweden, where the government has reduced expectations for future growth in GDP, can have an impact, mainly for product areas with nonrecurring revenue.",N/A,as_expected,2012,87

Some of these competitors are subject to fewer regulatory requirements in Denmark than TDC and base their price strategy on marginal cost considerations. The competition may intensify further in the future and lead to increased churn and decreasing ARPU across products and services in the consumer, business and wholesale market in Denmark and the other Nordic countries. A change of platform and technology has increased the competition from utilities that have rolled out fibre networks to offer landline telephony, broadband and TV. TDC TV and YouSee are also challenged by providers that offer Pay-TV services on other platforms, such as utility companies, DTH satellite distributors, DTT providers and operators offering TVoIP. Furthermore foreign distributors in the OTT market can be expected to gain parts of the VoD market. If operators currently relying on national roaming or MVNO agreements with TDC fast track their own network rollout, it will have a negative effect on TDC's wholesale business.",N/A,as_expected,2012,87

Future technological developments may cause TDC's price structure to deteriorate within one or more product markets. TDC may in the future be unable to keep up with the technological development and be unable to supply the solutions of the complexity demanded and may therefore lose momentum compared with its competitors. With increased complexity comes increased fault risk, which may lead to reduced customer satisfaction.

(g) _Calculation of Interest Amount: The Calculation Agent will, as soon as practicable after the time at which the Rate of Interest is to be determined in relation to each Interest Period, calculate the Interest Amount payable in respect of each Note for such Interest Period. The Interest Amount will be calculated by applying the Rate of Interest for such Interest Period to the Calculation Amount, multiplying the product by the relevant Day Count Fraction, rounding the resulting figure to the nearest sub-unit of the Specified Currency (half a sub-unit being rounded upwards) and multiplying such rounded figure by a fraction equal to the Specified Denomination of the relevant Note divided by the Calculation Amount. For this purpose a ""sub-unit"" means, in the case of any currency other than euro, the lowest amount of such currency that is available as legal tender in the country of such currency and, in the case of euro, means one cent.

Notice thereof shall also promptly be given to the Noteholders. The Calculation Agent will be entitled to recalculate any Interest Amount (on the basis of the foregoing provisions) without notice in the event of an extension or shortening of the relevant Interest Period. If the Calculation Amount is less than the minimum Specified Denomination the Calculation Agent shall not be obliged to publish each Interest Amount but instead may publish only the Calculation Amount and the Interest Amount in respect of a Note having the minimum Specified Denomination.

The EU Savings Tax Directive is, in principle, applied by Member States as from 1 July 2005 and has been implemented in Luxembourg by the laws of 21 June 2005. Under the EU Savings Tax Directive, each Member State is required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details of payments of interest or other similar income, within the meaning of the EU Savings Tax Directive, paid by a paying agent within the meaning of the EU Savings Tax Directive to an individual resident or certain types of entities called ""residual entities"", within the meaning of the EU Savings Tax Directive (the ""Residual Entity"" or ""Residual Entities""), established in that other Member State (or certain dependent or associated territories). For a transitional period, however, Austria and Luxembourg are permitted to apply an optional information reporting system whereby if a beneficial owner, within the meaning of the EU Savings Tax Directive, does not comply with one of two procedures for information reporting, the relevant Member State will levy a withholding tax on payments to such beneficial owner. The withholding tax system applies for a transitional period during which the rate of the withholding is 35 per cent. as from 1 July 2011. The transitional period is to terminate at the end of first full fiscal year following agreement by certain nonEU countries to the exchange of information relating to such payments. Also with effect from 1 July 2005, a number of non-EU countries (Switzerland, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Monaco and San Marino) and certain dependent or associated territories (Jersey, Guernsey, Isle of Man, Montserrat, British Virgin Islands, Netherlands Antilles, Aruba, Turk and Caïcos, Anguilla and the Cayman Islands) have agreed to adopt similar measures (either provision of information or transitional withholding) in relation to payments made by a paying agent (within the meaning of the EU Savings Tax ----- Directive) within its jurisdiction to, or collected by such a paying agent for, an individual resident or a Residual Entity established in a Member State. In addition, Luxembourg has entered into reciprocal provision of information or transitional withholding arrangements with those dependent or associated territories in relation to payments made by a paying agent (within the meaning of the EU Savings Tax Directive) in a Member State to, or collected by such a paying agent for, an individual resident or a Residual Entity established in one of those territories. The European Commission has announced on 13 November 2008 proposals to amend the EU Savings Tax Directive. If implemented, the proposed amendments would, _inter alia, (i) extend the scope of the EU Savings Tax Directive to payments made through certain intermediate structures (whether or not established in an EU Member State) for the ultimate benefit of EU resident individuals, and (ii) provide for a wider definition of interest subject to the EU Savings Tax Directive.

430_1,Offerings 2012.md,1395,GLOSSARY OF TECHNICAL TERMS,1395.1,,1395.1.1,,"_The following explanations are not intended as technical definitions, but to assist the general reader to understand certain terms as used in this Base Prospectus:_ ""3G"" means third-generation mobile networks that can deliver voice, data and multimedia content at high speed. ""ADSL"" means Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line, which is based on DSL technology. ""ARPU"" means the Average Revenue Per User and is calculated per month. TDC calculates ARPU for a given product group as its total revenue divided by the average RGUs in the period. ARPU includes gross traffic revenue unless otherwise stated. ""Broadband"" means data communication forms of a certain bandwidth that depending on the relevant context is perceived to be significantly high or 'wide' in terms of information-carrying capacity. The most common broadband technologies are cable modem, DSL, mobile broadband and optical fibre. TDC applies NITA's definition in which broadband implies bandwidths higher than 144 kbps. ""BSA"" or ""bitstream access"" means the situation where a provider installs a high-speed access link at the customer's premises and then makes this access link available to third parties, to enable them to provide high-speed services to customers. ""Coax"" means a technology based on coaxial cables - electrical cables with an inner conductor surrounded by a flexible, tubular insulating layer, surrounded by a tubular conducting shield. Coax is used to transmit, among other things, radio frequency signals and distributing cable television signals. ""CPE"" or ""customer premises equipment"" means equipment that is implemented or installed at a customer's premises. CPE includes the hardware required to handle TV as well as telephony and data traffic. Products handling telephony traffic range from large PABXs for the largest business corporations, to single telephones sold to small business customers and retail customers. Products handling data traffic consist mainly of routers, switches, DSL modems and other bridging equipment used to create LAN and WAN solutions. ""DSL"" or ""digital subscriber line"" means a technology that enables a local-loop copper pair to transport high-speed data between an exchange building and the customers' premises. ""DTH"" or ""direct-to-home"" refers to digital TV transmitted directly to households via satellite. ""DTT"" means digital terrestrial television, which is a digital signal broadcast to standard aerials that are utilised to replace the, in Denmark, discontinued analogue signal. ""Dual-play"" means the bundling of telephony and internet through one access channel only. Dual-play bundles are included as two customers in the total customer figures. All Fullrate xDSL customers are included as dual-play customers. A dual-play subscription must entail both services. ""Ethernet"" means a type of networking technology for LANs and is increasingly used in the IP-networks. ""Fibre optics communication"" or ""fibre"" means a technology used to transmit telephone signals, internet communications, and cable television signals. Due to much lower loss of intensity and interference, optical fibre has large advantages over existing copper wire in long-distance and high-demand applications. ""GSM"" or ""global system for mobile communications"" means a comprehensive digital network for the operation of all aspects of a mobile telephone system. ""IP"" or ""internet protocol"" means a standard protocol whereby internet-user data is divided into packets to be sent onto the correct network pathway. In addition, IP gives each packet an assigned number so that the message completion can be verified. Before packets are delivered to their destination, the protocol carries unifying procedures so that they are delivered in their original form. ----- ""IP-VPN"" means IP-based Virtual Private Network, which is a network that enables organisations to use a shared network to connect remote sites or users together. ""ISDN"" or ""integrated services digital network"" means a means of providing more channels of 64 kbps over the existing regular phone line, which can be used for either integrated voice and data or solely data transmission. An ISDN modem is necessary to connect to the network. The ISDN technology enables 230 channels at the same line. ""kbps"" means kilobits per second. ""LAN"" or ""local area network"" refers to a short-distance data communications network (typically within a company) used to link computers, which allows data and printer sharing. ""LTE"" or ""long term evolution"" means a set of enhancements to UMTS designed to increase capacity and speed on mobile telephone networks. ""MNO"" or ""mobile network operator"" means a company that has frequency allocation(s), as opposed to a MVNO, and all the required infrastructure to run an independent mobile network. ""MVNO"" or ""mobile virtual network operators"" means a mobile operator that does not have frequency allocation. MVNOs have business arrangements with MNOs to buy traffic and data for sale to their own customers. ""OTT"" or ""over the top"" refers to online delivery of video and audio without the internet service provider being involved in the control or distribution of the content itself. ""OPEX"" means operational expenditure. ""PABX"" or ""private automatic branch exchange"" is an automatic telephone switching system within a private enterprise. Originally, such systems - called private branch exchanges (PBX) - required the use of a live operator. As today almost all private branch exchanges are automatic, the abbreviation PBX has been extended to PABX. ""Prepaid"" means when the customer pays for a specified amount of credit for services upfront. The credit then diminishes as the customer uses the service. TDC considers online systems with prepayment characteristics to be mobile voice subscriptions, as users create accounts and generally remain subscribers longer. As a result, customers at Telmore and M1 are considered as mobile voice subscriptions. ""PSTN"" or ""public switched telephone network"" means the telecommunications network based on copper lines carrying analogue voice and data - traditional landline telephony. ""RGU"" means the total number of customer relationships that generate revenue for TDC, including customers with subscription and customers without subscriptions calculated according to the following general principles: Landline customers who have generated revenue within the last 3 months; prepaid cards used at least once within the last 3 months; dial-up internet customers who accessed the internet at least once within the last 3 months. TDC's RGU statement includes the number of main products sold by TDC's residential, business and wholesale segments. The number of customers is not equal to the number of subscribers. An enterprise with 100 mobile voice subscriptions from TDC will be included as 100 RGUs in the RGU statement. As regards wholesale customers, a broadband provider with 20,000 BSA connections from TDC will be included as 20,000 RGUs. For other networks and data connections, the RGU category that is part of TDC's RGU base includes ULL, leased lines, fibre and data connection. Mobile broadband RGUs include mobile data cards and mobile broadband subscriptions. Dual- and tripleplay bundles are included as two and three RGUs, respectively, in the total RGU figures. A YouSee TV customer subscribing to the digital TV add-on product YouSee Plus will be included as two TV RGUs. The term ""RGU"" does not reflect the number of actual end-users, e.g., an ISDN30 connection counts only as one RGU in TDC's customer base even though this product may involve 30 end-users. ""SDH"" or ""Synchronous Digital Hierarchy"" means a standard technology for synchronous data transmission on optical media and provides faster and less-expensive network interconnection than traditional PDH (Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy) equipment. In digital telephone transmission, synchronous means that the bits from one call are carried within one transmission frame. Plesiochronous means ""almost synchronous"" or a call that must be extracted from more than one transmission frame. ----- ""SHDSL"" or ""Symmetric High-speed Digital Subscriber Line"" means DSL technology with symmetric data transmission. ""Triple-play"" means the bundling of telephony, internet and TV services through one access channel only. Triple play bundles are included as three customers in the total customer figures. A triple-play subscription must entail all three services. ""TV"" means television. ""TVoIP"" or ""TV over internet protocol"" means a system through which digital TV service is delivered using the internet and internet broadband access networks instead of being delivered through the traditional radio frequency broadcast, satellite signal or cable TV formats. TVoIP can be either IP TV or Web TV. ""ULL"" or ""unbundled local loop"" means copper lines to which competing carriers have been granted access by the incumbent operator, allowing such alternative carriers to offer data transmission capacity and/or telephony to end users. (ULL is often referred to as raw copper.) Full ULL is used for customers without PSTN/ISDN subscription (wholesale or retail at TDC), shared ULL is used for customers with PSTN/ISDN subscriptions. ""UMTS"" or ""universal mobile telecommunications systems"" means a 3G network designed to provide a wide range of voice, high-speed data and multimedia services. ""VDSL"" means a DSL technology that provides faster data transmission than other DSL technologies over copper wires. ""VoD"" or ""video-on-demand"" refers to transmission delivery of video (films or other video content) to a single user on request. ""VoIP"" or ""voice over internet protocol"" means a telephone call over the internet. VoIP can be either with quality of service, i.e., guarantee of call quality comparable to PSTN, achieved through prioritising the traffic. Alternatively, VoIP can be computer to computer calls, with unprioritised traffic. This traffic is generally of a lower quality and is affected by general network usage and will be interrupted by network congestion. TDC VoIP is with quality of service. ""WAN"" or ""wide area network"" refers to a long-distance data communications network and is a geographically dispersed collection of LANs. The internet, for instance, is a WAN, but a network between a company's divisions can also be a WAN. ""xDSL"" means a family of technologies that provides digital data transmission over copper wires. See also ADSL, VDSL and SHDSL. -----",N/A,as_expected,2012,87
