**RISK FACTORS**

_The Issuer believes that the following factors may affect its ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes._
_Most of these factors are contingencies which may or may not occur and the Issuer is not in a position to_
_express a view on the likelihood of any such contingency occurring._

_In addition, factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with the_
_Notes are described below._

_The Issuer believes that the factors described below represent the principal risks inherent in investing in the_
_Notes, but the inability of the Issuer to pay interest, principal or other amounts on or in connection with the_
_Notes may occur for other reasons which may not be considered significant risks by the Issuer based on_
_information currently available to it or which it may not currently be able to anticipate. Prospective_
_investors should also read the detailed information set out elsewhere in this Prospectus and reach their own_
_views prior to making any investment decision._

**Factors that may affect the Issuer's ability to fulfil its obligations under the Notes**

The business of TDC A/S (TDC) and its consolidated subsidiaries (together with TDC, the TDC Group) is
exposed to various risks including intensified competition, changes in the economic environment,
operational and technological developments, environmental challenges, changes in relation to suppliers and
distributors, inability to control costs, loss of key personnel, regulatory changes, financial and taxation risks
and legal risks. Any such risks could harm the TDC Group and adversely affect the TDC Group’s business,
financial position, results of operations or cash flow.

**_Domestic Business Activities_**

_Market risks_

The Danish telecommunications sector is highly competitive, and a number of the main markets in which the
TDC Group is present are either approaching saturation, for example, broadband and mobile telephony, or
even declining, such as landline telephony.

In all markets in which the TDC Group operates, its future success will depend on the TDC Group’s ability
to stimulate and increase usage, for example, by offering add-on services to continuously attract new
customers, and especially retain existing customers, thereby maintaining a sufficiently large customer base to
achieve profitable operations. The TDC Group is therefore focusing on market initiatives that increase
customer loyalty. At the same time, price regulation is limiting prices in a number of markets and even
implying price decreases, which are resulting in revenue decline in areas such as mobile termination and
international roaming. If the TDC Group fails to increase sales to existing customers or expand its subscriber
base and increase total revenue as a result of the market saturation, the TDC Group’s business, financial
position and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.

The TDC Group expects the future landline market to be dominated by providers offering bundles such as
broadband, telephony and TV in one package, and the TDC Group has recently launched TDC HomeDuo
and TDC HomeTrio, both bundled product combinations. However, such types of bundled products
complicate matters due to the technological, logistical and pricing complexities of combining these three
services as a single product offering. If the TDC Group fails to adapt to or lead technological developments,
or to offer attractive packages of bundled products, the TDC Group’s market shares and profit margins in the
landline business may be adversely affected.


-----

_Competitors_

The TDC Group faces significant competition from both established competitors, such as Telenor and
TeliaSonera, and newer competitors such as utility companies, HI3G Denmark ApS (which is part of the
conglomerate Hutchinson Whampoa), mobile service providers and the digital terrestrian television (DTT)
provider Boxer. The TDC Group must match its competitors’ product offerings, services, acquisition costs,
and prices, or it may lose market shares. If the TDC Group is forced to lower its prices to match its
competitors and if cost savings initiatives are not implemented with the required speed and effect, the TDC
Group may experience decreasing profit margins and earnings.

_Telephony_

The customer base for traditional landline telephony is decreasing owing to strong landline-to-mobile
migration and migration to Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) as mobile prices decrease and as broadband
providers are offering VoIP at reduced prices compared with traditional Public Switched Telephone Network
(PSTN) telephony. Continuing competition is also expected in landline telephony from internet protocolbased internal networks (such as internet protocol virtual private networks for business customers), antenna
and housing association networks and the utility companies using their infrastructure to provide telephony
and broadband. In all, the TDC Group may risk losing its PSTN customers even faster than expected.
Compared with the traditional landline market, the TDC Group has smaller shares of both the mobile
telephony market and the VoIP market, which implies that migration may negatively affect the TDC Group’s
earnings. Even if the TDC Group could manage to capture all of the customer migration from traditional
landline telephony to the substitution products, the TDC Group’s total telephony business may still
experience decreasing profit, as margins for these substitution products are generally lower than the margins
for traditional telephony, for example the TDC Group’s own price level for VoIP is lower than that for
PSTN.

Similarly, low-cost VoIP may threaten the TDC Group’s mobile telephony business in the long term, as will
the continuing decreases in market prices of mobile telephony. Failure to lead or adapt to changes in the
mobile market, to keep pace with new mobile technologies or to compete with or adopt new business models
may have a materially adverse effect on the TDC Group’s mobile business.

_Broadband and data_

The Danish landline broadband market had minimal growth in 2008 and the market is approaching
saturation. At the same time, competition has intensified among existing and new competitors, resulting in
increased bandwidth at unchanged prices or even reduced prices as well as more competition for broadband
add-on services. In turn, the market for mobile broadband is growing strongly and mobile broadband appears
for some customers to be a viable alternative to landline broadband, as prices have decreased while
bandwidth and coverage have increased.

The TDC Group, as the dominant player in the Danish landline broadband market, has to lead or adapt to
product and technological developments, including market demand for even higher digital subscriber line
(DSL) speeds, add-on service offerings and bundling of mobile and landline broadband, telephony and TV,
in order to maintain its customer base. In the mobile broadband market, the TDC Group’s market share is
increasing, but the success of the TDC Group will depend on its ability to further increase its mobile
broadband market share as the overall market grows. This will require that the TDC Group adapts to market
demands for higher bandwidths, increased coverage and attractive pricing. If the TDC Group does not
succeed in increasing its mobile broadband market share, a possible migration from landline broadband to
mobile broadband will negatively affect the TDC Group’s business, financial position, results of operations
and cash flow.


-----

Continuing competition for leased lines is likely from substitution products, including Internet Protocol (IP)based transmission and fiber solutions. Such products are often priced lower than leased lines, and product
quality may be considered sufficiently high by some customer segments to constitute a viable alternative to
traditional leased line solutions. This may result in either increased pressure on the TDC Group’s leased line
prices or a reduced subscriber base.

_TV_

YouSee’s cable-TV business, a subsidiary of the TDC Group, and the IP-based TDC TV are expected to face
increasing competition from sources such as the utility companies and DTT. Competition is driven by price,
convenience and the range of channels offered. At the end of March 2008, the Swedish operator Boxer was
selected as the commercial gatekeeper for DTT in Denmark. Boxer offers four basic packages with a variety
of additional packages and channels[∗]. The increased range of channels in the generally accessible terrestrial
network, as well as the supply of TV through the utility companies’ roll-out of 'Fiber to the Home' (FTTH),
will significantly increase competition and the profit margins on TV for the TDC Group may be adversely
affected. In the long term, increased competition in the Danish cable-TV market may also arise from
internet-based content providers, for example, media and communications companies. Failure by TDC
Group to meet these challenges may have a materially adverse effect on the TDC Group’s market share of
the Danish TV-distribution market.

_Online_

Online represents an increasing sales channel for telecommunications products and services. The online
portal is a potential means of reducing selling expenses and stimulating sales per customer. The TDC Group
is challenged by competitors that may develop successful online portals more quickly. Thus, if the TDC
Group is unable to further develop the online channel to explore the potential market and develop an
effective online procedure, this may negatively impact the TDC Group’s revenue and costs.

_Content_

Technological developments are increasingly enabling customers to receive content whenever and wherever
they wish, and are contributing to increasing demand for content. Future growth in content services is
expected to be driven by increased quantitative and qualitative capabilities of content providers. The TDC
Group’s cable-TV business, YouSee, has given the TDC Group significant experience of, and access to, the
content market and content delivery products. The TDC Group’s future success with content services will
depend on its ability to offer attractive TV channels and popular music and games, and to adapt and lead
technological developments in content delivery. Failure to provide content services and adapt to
technological developments may negatively impact sales of the TDC Group’s products and services with a
content component, such as cable TV, broadband and mobile.

_Economic recession_

The current recession in the Danish economy and the ongoing crisis in the global financial markets might
affect both the residential and business telecoms markets in which the TDC Group operates. In the business
markets, potential customers may be exposed to reduced investment levels, lower profit, restructuring and
consolidation, leading to a review of telecom spending or increased level of foreclosures that could for
example, result in reduced revenue in the TDC Group’s integrator service business, and possibly increased
churn in all business areas. Residential markets are experiencing higher unemployment, lower disposable
income and a decrease in consumer spending, which may result in an increased focus on the basic telecoms
services and low-cost services. One consequence could be fewer mobile broadband customers than expected,
and lower average revenue per user (ARPU) than expected for both mobile broadband and landline
broadband, and possibly also increased churn rates in the residential telecoms markets. These factors may

-----

negatively affect the TDC Group’s business, financial position and results of operations in its Danish, Nordic
and international businesses.

**_Operational risks_**

_IT, technology and networks_

In 2008, the TDC Group completed the design of the end-state IT architecture that is expected to enable the
TDC Group to lower costs and at the same time improve customer satisfaction through reduced delivery
times and improved customer insight. During the ongoing upgrade process, the TDC Group may discover
issues not included in the plan, which may entail additional investments that the TDC Group cannot be sure
to have sufficient liquidity to fund in the future, and this may have adverse effects on its business and results
of operations.

The TDC Group has modern networks, is rolling out technologies such as third generation (3G), FTTH and
Ethernet, and offers new products such as VoIP, mobile broadband and internet protocol TV. The
technological innovation and product development, however, are rapidly continuing and the TDC Group
must react to these changes, and develop or apply new, enhanced products and services rapidly enough to
maintain its position. If the technologies develop faster than the TDC Group anticipates, greater capital
investments may be required more quickly than expected for which the TDC Group may not have the
resources available. This would adversely affect the TDC Group’s business, as market shares and customers
may be lost, and substitution technologies introduced by competitors may result in lower profit margins.
New technologies may become dominant, rendering the TDC Group’s current systems obsolete. There is
also a risk that the TDC Group may fail commercially, and not reach as many customers as expected despite
the development of an attractive product portfolio.

Equipment and network systems are vulnerable in many respects. The TDC Group’s equipment and
networks have been affected by floods and storms in the past, and steps have been taken to improve the
situation through preventive maintenance. If, however, the damage to network and installations increases, the
TDC Group’s costs will increase, and, moreover, the image of a reliable telecommunications provider could
potentially suffer. The TDC Group’s networks and services may be damaged or disrupted by numerous
other events, including fire, other natural disasters, power outages and equipment or system failures (major
disruptive events). The TDC Group’s equipment and networks may further be subject to terrorist attacks,
and other events that may disrupt the TDC Group’s services.

A major disruption event could affect the TDC Group’s infrastructure or a third party’s systems, resulting in
failure of the TDC Group’s networks or systems or of the third-party-owned local and long-distance
networks on which the TDC Group relies to provide its subscribers with interconnection and roaming
services. This could affect the quality of the TDC Group’s services or cause temporary service interruptions,
which could result in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory penalties and reduced revenue. Network or system
failures could also harm the TDC Group’s reputation or impair the TDC Group’s ability to attract new
customers, which could have a materially adverse effect on the TDC Group’s business, financial position and
results of operations. The TDC Group’s business continuity plans, network security policies, or the TDC
Group’s monitoring activities may not mitigate the impact of or prevent such disruptive events.

The TDC Group’s business relies on certain sophisticated critical systems, including exchanges, switches,
other key network points and the TDC Group’s billing and customer service systems. The hardware
supporting those systems is housed at relatively few locations and if damage were to occur to any of these
locations, or if those systems develop other problems, the TDC Group’s business could be materially
adversely affected.

Based on risk analyses, it is the TDC Group’s policy not to insure a substantial part of the network
(underground, air and sea cables). Losses in this part of the network due to numerous events, such as fire,


-----

flood or other natural disasters, power outages and equipment or system failures, and terrorist acts are not
insured, and the TDC Group may not have the capital to make necessary repairs or replacements.

As the telecommunications sector has become increasingly digitalized, automated and online, the TDC
Group is also exposed to increasing risks of hacking, piracy and general IT system failures. Unanticipated IT
problems, system failures, computer viruses or hacker attacks could affect the quality of the TDC Group’s
services and cause service interruptions, which may reduce revenue and harm the TDC Group’s reputation.

_Risk of discontinuance of supplier relations_

In the past years the TDC Group has outsourced substantial parts of its IT operation and development to the
Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and operation and development of the mobile network to Ericsson
Danmark A/S. This has exposed the TDC Group to additional operational dependency and risks, as the TDC
Group relies on these and other suppliers to maintain and upgrade its hardware, software and network. Any
discontinuance of these supply agreements, or failure by the TDC Group’s suppliers to comply with their
obligations under these agreements, any financial instability of its suppliers or failure to deliver certain
products to the TDC Group according to supplier contracts in the future, could lead to the delay of upgrades
and new products and features from suppliers. These risks could be amplified if suppliers off-shore part of
their businesses. Such actions could impact the TDC Group’s product development programs and supply of
existing products and deteriorate the quality of the support services, which could affect operational and
customer services and increase in-stock levels affected by customer-returned equipment. Failure by
suppliers, which may delay or prevent the TDC Group from providing its customers with products and
services, may adversely impact the TDC Group’s revenue, and if this occurs, the TDC Group may be unable
to recover payments made to such suppliers for their products and services or obtain contractual damages.
The TDC Group’s internal processes also depend on IT systems, and lack of development may weaken the
TDC Group’s competitiveness, resulting in loss of market shares.

Although most of the TDC Group’s equipment and software suppliers can be replaced, switching to
alternative suppliers could cause difficulty or delays in providing support and maintenance, new products
and upgrades, and operational services, which could harm the TDC Group’s financial position and results of
operations. Moreover, the termination of such agreements may lead to loss of business from certain
supplementary service providers that the TDC Group may be unable to maintain through independent
relationships. Furthermore, any price rises introduced by suppliers may cause a margin squeeze, which could
also adversely impact the TDC Group’s business, financial position and results of operations.

_Risks regarding distributors_

The TDC Group depends on a small number of distributors, retailers and sales agencies to distribute or sell
its mobile and broadband products and other services to end users. There is a risk that the TDC Group’s
distributors may stop distributing the TDC Group’s products to end users and may enter into further
distribution agreements with the TDC Group’s competitors. New distributors that can provide the same level
of sales, may be difficult to find. In addition, the TDC Group’s distributors already have distribution
agreements with the TDC Group’s competitors that may negatively affect gross activations and thus the TDC
Group’s market share. The TDC Group’s distributors may more actively promote competitors’ products and
services. If the TDC Group fails to maintain these key distribution relationships, or its distribution partners
fail to procure sufficient customers for the TDC Group, this could have a materially adverse effect on the
TDC Group’s financial position and results of operations.

_Risk of inability to recoup the Universal Mobile Telecommunications Systems (UMTS) and fibernet_
_investments_

The TDC Group’s UMTS-based 3G service in Denmark has required substantial investments in UMTS
services, networks, and licenses. A profitable market for mobile data services may, however, not develop,


-----

limiting the TDC Group’s ability to recoup its investments in UMTS services, licenses and networks, which
could adversely affect its results of operations. The UMTS network will in addition require further
investments, for which the TDC Group may not have resources available.

The TDC Group's fibre network strategy has required substantial investments in networks, including the
recent acquisition of Dong Energy Sales & Distribution A/S's (Dong Energy) fiber network. There is a risk
that the investments may not be recouped if demand for fibre does not develop as expected by the TDC
Group.

_Risks regarding the revenue sharing model with Dong Energy_

As a part of the sales agreement between Dong Energy and the TDC Group regarding the acquisition of
Dong Energy's fibre network, Dong Energy will receive a part of future fibre revenues generated by the TDC
Group. Even though the revenue share model to be followed has been agreed, there is a risk that following
such a model will result in disputes between Dong Energy and the TDC Group, given the duration of the
agreement, which is very comprehensive and is set to proceed until 2023. If the revenue share agreement is
disputed, the TDC Group may be compelled to settle with Dong Energy before expiration of the revenue
share agreement at a higher price than expected.

_Risk of inability to control other costs_

As the TDC Group’s profitability is under general pressure owing to declining market prices and market
saturation it is continuously required to reduce costs and improve efficiency to maintain and improve
profitability.

As part of its cost reduction initiatives, the TDC Group will continue to streamline its workforce in the years
ahead. Many of the TDC Group’s employees in Denmark, however, have civil servant pension rights and
some are entitled to special severance benefits. Therefore any workforce reduction entails significant
redundancy costs, which would affect the TDC Group’s earnings. Although Danish law imposes no
significant restrictions on workforce reductions, and the TDC Group’s labor unions have no right under
Danish law to veto any workforce reductions, reductions may lead to strikes, work stoppages or other
industrial action. The TDC Group has therefore entered into arrangements to prevent unrest with the
telecommunications departments of the Danish Metal Workers Union, the Association of Managers and
Employees in Special Positions of Trust in TDC (Lederforeningen i TDC, LTD) and the Danish
Confederation of Professional Associations (Akademikernes Centralorganisation - _AC). In these_
arrangements, the TDC Group has agreed to follow certain procedural guidelines when reducing its
workforce. The arrangements will expire at the end of 2011.

In addition, costs associated with the operating licenses for the TDC Group’s existing networks and
technologies, including UMTS and those that the TDC Group may develop in the future, and related costs
and rental expenses could be considerable. The amount and timing of future capital requirements may differ
materially from current estimates due to various factors, many beyond the TDC Group’s control. It is
uncertain whether sufficient cash flows will be generated in the future to meet capital expenditure needs,
sustain operations or meet other capital requirements.

_Risk of loss of key personnel_

The TDC Group’s success relies heavily on the skills, experience and efforts of its management. In addition,
as the TDC Group’s business develops in a highly competitive market, the TDC Group believes that its
future success will depend on its continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel.


-----

_Risks regarding third parties_

The TDC Group’s cooperation agreements and contracts with suppliers are subject to change of control
provisions which, if exercised by third parties, may adversely affect the TDC Group’s competitiveness and
profitability.

The TDC Group’s high-quality mobile and landline telecoms services outside Denmark depend on
interconnection with the telecoms networks and services of other mobile and landline operators, particularly
larger competitors, over which the TDC Group has no direct control. Outside Denmark, the TDC Group also
relies on third-party operators for international roaming services for mobile subscribers. For example, in
Switzerland, the TDC Group depends on Swisscom’s local loop network and facilities to reach a significant
number of end users. These components may be impaired or slower than the TDC Group anticipated,
affecting the TDC Group’s ability to roll out additional direct access products and attract direct access
customers.

The TDC Group has interconnection and roaming agreements with other operators, but has no direct control
over the quality of their networks and the interconnections and roaming services they provide. Any
difficulties or delays in interconnecting with other networks and services, or unreliable interconnection
services, could result in a loss of subscribers or a decrease in traffic, which would reduce the TDC Group’s
revenue and adversely affect TDC’s financial position and results of operations.

**_Regulatory Risks_**

Denmark’s regulatory regime governing its telecoms sector requires TDC to deliver a broad range of
products to the retail and wholesale markets, and subjects TDC to price regulation and other regulatory
requirements. The price regulation has in general resulted in favorable conditions for TDC’s competitors in
Denmark and thus negatively affected TDC’s competitiveness.

_EU regulatory framework_

Several EU directives implemented in Danish law specify a number of submarkets within landline telephony,
mobile telephony, leased lines, unbundled access, broadband and TV and radio transmission on which the
National IT and Telecom Agency (NITA) must perform market analyses. Based on the results of the market
analyses, NITA may designate a dominant telecommunications provider as having 'significant market power'
(SMP) in such a submarket. If imperfections in a submarket in which an operator has been designated as
having SMP are identified, NITA may impose remedies against such an operator in order to promote
competition. In the wholesale market, such measures may include the acceptance of a reasonable request for
interconnection, non-discrimination, reference offers, transparency, accounting separation, specific costaccounting obligations and price-control methods.

Initially, 18 submarkets were recommended by the EU Commission, and NITA has issued final decisions on
all the submarkets. A new round of market analyses was initiated by NITA in 2008 based on a new EU
Commission recommendation that has reduced the number of submarkets to seven. So far, NITA has issued
only one decision on the new submarkets. The current regulation will be maintained until new decisions are
made.

The EU regulatory framework is currently being reviewed, which may result in new regulatory measures to
be implemented into Danish law.

_SMP designation_

TDC has been designated as having SMP by NITA in 11 of the 18 initially specified submarkets in Denmark.
TDC has also been designated as having SMP by NITA in the only decision so far on the new submarket for


-----

wholesale (physical) network infrastructure access (including shared or fully unbundled access) at a fixed
location, which replaces the NITA’s decision on the equivalent submarket included in the initial 18
submarkets.

As a result, TDC is subject to the regulatory burdens summarized below. NITA may impose additional
regulatory requirements on TDC as a result of its current SMP status or give TDC SMP status in additional
markets as a result of the analyses performed on the new markets.

_Retail markets_

The majority of TDC’s retail offerings of leased lines must comply with a rule-of-cost orientation imposed as
a result of TDC’s SMP status. TDC is therefore required to calibrate leased line prices annually to ensure that
they match the corresponding cost. TDC has also been designated as having SMP status on four retail
submarkets for landline subscriptions and telephony without being subjected to any regulatory requirements.

_Wholesale markets_

The majority of TDC’s prices are regulated in the wholesale markets where TDC has SMP status. Since 1
January 2003, NITA has used a landline long run average incremental cost (LRAIC) model to set TDC’s
prices for switched interconnection traffic, interconnection capacity, shared access and raw copper and
related co-location. From 2007, the pricing of bitstream access and sub-loops of the unbundled local loop
(the ULL) has been included in the LRAIC model. NITA calculates these prices once a year in accordance
with the LRAIC model. The LRAIC model for 2009 has resulted in price decreases for bitstream access. The
next comprehensive adjustment of the LRAIC model for the landline network has been initiated. The revised
model will be based on a hypothetical 'all-internet protocol network', which may lead to significant
reductions of the LRAIC regulated prices from 1 January 2010.

In the market for termination of mobile calls, NITA has decided that TDC, Telia, Sonofon, Barablu and
Hi3G have SMP and are subject to price regulation. The mobile termination prices of TDC, Telia, Sonofon,
and Hi3G are set using a LRAIC mobile model, whereas the mobile termination prices of Barablu are set
according to a best practice analysis. The regulation has resulted in further price decreases compared with
already regulated prices and will adversely impact the TDC Group’s business and results of operations.

The EU Commission is currently drafting a recommendation for a fundamental change of the long run
investment cost pricing regulation method regarding both landline and mobile to the avoidable cost method,
which could lead to significant reduction of wholesale prices and thus also adversely impact the TDC
Group’s earnings and increase the competitive power of the TDC Group’s competitors.

NITA’s decision in 2006 on the submarket for broadband access requires TDC to offer wholesale broadband
solutions (bitstream access) without compulsory landline subscriptions, which improved TDC’s competitors’
conditions for offering broadband solutions combined with VoIP. A revised market analysis and decision on
the submarket for broadband access is expected by the end of 2009.  In this new analysis, broadband over
the cable-TV network, as supplied by TDC’s subsidiary YouSee and other cable operators, will probably be
included in the market definition. The revised decision may require TDC to offer wholesale access to
broadband over the cable-TV network and may fuel further competition on the broadband market.

_EU Universal Service Obligation (USO) directive_

TDC is designated as the universal service provider (USP) in Denmark, in line with the EU USO Directive
and Danish USO Regulation, which are designed to ensure that all end users have access to certain basic
affordable telecommunications services regardless of their geographical location. In the past, NITA fixed the
prices that TDC could charge its Danish USO customers for using PSTN services, but these price caps were
lifted at the end of 2005. However, NITA may reintroduce a price cap on TDC’s USO products and services
at some point in the future.


-----

_EU international roaming charge regulation_

The EU has adopted a new regulation that reduces the international roaming charges both for the wholesale
and retail voice and short message service (SMS) as well as for the wholesale data markets, which will have
a negative impact on the TDC Group’s revenue and earnings.

_Anti-terror measures_

As part of the anti-terrorism action plan issued in 2005, the Danish parliament has passed an act requiring
telecommunications providers to provide communication interception services without cost compensation for
investments. As a result of executive orders from 2006 and a subsequent amendment of the
Telecommunications Act in 2007 (Amendment Act No. 200 of 6 March 2007), telecommunications
providers are required to retain and store traffic data for one year for the purpose of investigation and
prosecution of criminal offences. Also, telecommunications providers are required to establish the necessary
logging functions and databases and cover any equipment costs related to the abovementioned data retention.
As a result, the TDC Group must make ongoing additional investments in technical equipment and cover
operating costs.

**_International Business Activities_**

_Nordic Business_

In the pan-Nordic market, the TDC Group’s business customers are increasingly demanding Nordic solutions
covering cross-border landline telephony, data communications, broadband telephony and mobile
communications, where competition, especially from other pan-Nordic providers, is intense. The TDC
Group faces increasing competition from the Nordic operators Telenor and TeliaSonera, which both offer
full product suites of fixed and mobile voice, broadband and TV. These competitors may have better access
to financing, more comprehensive product offerings, greater personnel resources, greater brand-name
recognition and longer relationships with customers than the TDC Group. If the TDC Group is unable to
provide competitive cross-border solutions for the TDC Group’s Nordic business customers, an important
segment of the TDC Group’s customer base may be lost.

TDC’s foreign subsidiaries outside the pan-Nordic market are also facing market saturation and increasing
competition, which could adversely affect their revenue and profit margins.

_Sunrise_

On 25 November 2009, TDC announced that it has entered into a conditional agreement to combine its Swiss
subsidiary Sunrise Communications SA (Sunrise) with Orange Communications SA (Orange), a subsidiary
of France Telecom SA (France Telecom) (also see "Business combination of Sunrise and Orange in
_Switzerland" in Recent Events below)._

The combined entity will have a share buyback programme targeted at TDC's 25 per cent. shareholding to be
executed at the discretion of the board of the combined entity using cash generated by the combined entity. If
so decided, the annual share buybacks will be executed in the first quarter of each of 2012, 2013 and 2014.
Furthermore, TDC will have the right to sell its stake to third parties from the second anniversary of the
closing of the transaction or to conduct an initial public offering of the combined entity in respect of TDC's
share from the third anniversary of the transaction's close.

The transaction shall, amongst other conditions, be subject to confirmatory due diligence and approvals from
TDC's lenders and the Swiss competition authorities.

There is also a risk that the exit strategy as agreed between the parties may not be completed as anticipated,
as the share buy-back provisions are subject to the combined entity having sufficient available cash and


-----

reserves and board approval of the combined entity. TDC may not be able to avail itself of its rights to sell
its holding to third parties after two years or its right to offer its shares in an IPO.

The TDC Group may be exposed to unsubstantiated or inadequate management decisions made on behalf of
the combined entity over which TDC does not have full control. The other shareholder may fail to or be
unwilling to supply the required operational, strategic and financial resources relating to, for example, the
build-out of infrastructure, and the cost of meeting regulatory requirements or effective marketing, which
could adversely affect the implementation of business plans of the combined entity, and the expected return
on TDC’s investment and/or exit strategy.

There are also existing risks relating to the current business conducted by Sunrise. It has experienced price
decreases in the Swiss landline market owing to competition from established competitors, for example, the
incumbent Swisscom, which may result in loss of customers, reduced revenue and a lower profit margin in
Switzerland. Such competition is expected to intensify as established cable network operators, such as
Cablecom, are offering landline telephony at very low or flat-rate prices through their existing networks.

Competition in the Swiss retail broadband market is weak due to Swisscom’s dominant position in the
wholesale and retail markets. Sunrise is currently investing substantial amounts in broadband infrastructure
to enhance its capacity to deliver broadband based on Swisscom’s ULL. This will reduce Sunrise’s
dependency on Swisscom’s broadband wholesale services and is expected to increase Sunrise’s contribution
margin and competitiveness in the broadband market. Any roll-out delays will therefore adversely impact
Sunrise’s expected margin improvement.

In the Swiss mobile market, Sunrise faces the risk of increased pricing pressure from both new mobile virtual
network operators entering the market and Swisscom. Future growth in revenue and earnings within the
mobile telephony sector will also depend on Sunrise’s ability to gain market shares in the business market,
which Sunrise may be unable to achieve. In the past year, Swisscom’s attempt to retain its market share has
intensified competition, which may reduce margins and dilute earnings. The Swiss mobile market is
beginning to approach saturation level. This may lead to fierce competition for remaining customers, which
could, in turn, lead to rising customer acquisition and retention costs, and further pressure on earnings.

Sunrise has outsourced its operation and development of networks. The outsourcing to Alcatel-Lucent
exposes Sunrise to the same risks as the TDC Group’s domestic mobile business (as described in the section
above on risk regarding discontinuance of suppliers).

_Regulatory risks_

Due to the EU regulation on international roaming and the subsequent price reduction made by Swisscom,
political and regulatory pressure, especially for data roaming, could lead to price decreases in this area.

The Swiss competition authority is reviewing competition in the mobile call termination market and is
currently investigating whether the Swiss mobile operators, including Sunrise, have a dominant position and,
if so, abuse such a position. Consequently, the Swiss authorities may require Swisscom and/or Sunrise to cut
the mobile call termination prices agreed between the operators step by step. Such price reductions may
materially adversely affect the earnings and profit margins of the TDC Group’s Swiss operations. It is
uncertain whether the Swiss competition authority will impose a material fine on Sunrise if Sunrise is found
to have a dominant position in the mobile call termination market and to have abused such a position.

The Swiss regulatory authority for the Swiss telecommunications market has decided ULL tariffs for 2007
and 2008 and Sunrise’s business plan and earnings forecasts are based on ULL prices near the EU average.
The decided prices are comparable with the EU average, but are increasing. If this trend continues, Sunrise’s
forecasts must be adjusted downwards. Moreover, utility companies will start using their infrastructure to


-----

provide telephony and broadband services, and they will probably subsidize the telecommunications
business, which could lead to additional margin pressure.

The TDC Group’s UMTS-based 3G service in Switzerland has required substantial investments in services,
networks, and licenses. As in Denmark, a favorable market for UMTS-based 3G services may not develop,
limiting the TDC Group’s ability to recoup its investments in UMTS services, licenses and networks, which
could adversely affect the TDC Group’s business and results of operations.

_Nawras_

TDC has a 14.6 per cent. share of the Omani Qatari Telecommunications Company SAOC (Nawras), a
mobile telephony provider. This shareholding is subject to the same risks as the TDC Group, but also
exposes the TDC Group‘s business to unsubstantiated or inadequate management decisions made on behalf
of companies over which TDC does not have full control and that rely on TDC and/or other shareholders for
strategic and financial support. Such other shareholders may fail to or be unwilling to supply the required
operational, strategic and financial resources relating to, for example, the build-out of infrastructure, and the
cost of meeting regulatory requirements or effective marketing, which could adversely affect the
implementation of business plans, and the expected return on TDC’s investment.

**_Financial and taxation risks_**

_Exchange rate risks_

The TDC Group is subject to exchange-rate risks owing to revenue originating in Switzerland, Sweden and
Norway where the TDC Group conducts its business operations and prepares its financial statements in
currencies other than Danish kroner or euro. Any loss in the value of these currencies against the Danish
kroner will reduce the value of the TDC Group’s investments in the relevant business activities and the
income derived from them.

_Risks regarding borrowing facilities_

Part of TDC's debt has a floating interest rate and hence an increase in interest rates will raise TDC’s
payment obligations and negatively impact its financial results and position. Hedging may also be expensive
to maintain and may inadequately protect TDC against adverse movements in interest rates.

TDC’s ability to generate the significant amount of cash needed to service its debt depends on many factors
beyond its control. TDC’s ability to pay and refinance its debt and fund working capital and capital
expenditures will depend on its future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This
depends, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and
other factors, many of which are beyond TDC’s control, as well as the other factors discussed in this section.
Noteholders cannot be sure that the TDC Group’s business will generate sufficient cash flows from
operations or that sufficient future debt and equity financing will be available for TDC to pay its debts when
due or to fund its liquidity needs. If TDC’s future cash flows from operations and other capital resources
(including its existing borrowing facilities) are insufficient to pay its debts as they mature or to fund its
liquidity needs, TDC may be forced to reduce or delay its business activities and capital expenditures, sell
assets, raise additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance all or a portion of TDC’s debt on or
before maturity.

Noteholders cannot be certain that any of these alternatives will be accomplished on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms. In addition, the terms of TDC’s debt, and that of its parent company and any future debt,
may limit TDC’s ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

TDC is subject to significant restrictive debt covenants that limit its operating flexibility under its existing
borrowing facilities, including covenants that restrict TDC’s ability to for example, incur or guarantee


-----

additional indebtedness, make investments or other restricted payments, create liens or consolidate, merge or
sell all or substantially all of TDC’s assets.

These covenants could limit TDC’s ability to finance its future operations and capital needs and pursue
acquisitions, investments and other business activities that may be in its interest.

TDC's existing borrowing facilities require it to comply with financial ratios and satisfy specified financial
tests. Events beyond TDC’s control may affect its ability to do so and, as a result, TDC cannot assure
Noteholders that these ratios and tests will be met. If a default occurs under such agreements, the lenders
thereto could terminate their commitments and upon acceleration declare all amounts owed to them due and
payable. Defaults in relation to certain of TDC's parent company's debt would also result in a default in
accordance with TDC's existing borrowing facilities. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain
cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions could also be accelerated and become due and payable in such
circumstances. TDC may be unable to pay these debts in such circumstances.

_TDC is subject to restrictions on paying dividends / making upstream loans_

TDC’s ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute funds, including upstream loans and other debts, is
subject to restrictions under applicable Danish law and certain other restrictions for example, earnings
retained for distribution. TDC’s dividend and distribution capacity may be inadequate to fund distributions in
amounts and in time to allow its parent company to pay its debts as they fall due, which may result in crossacceleration or cross-default provisions being triggered in TDC's existing borrowing facilities.

_Risks regarding changes in tax legislation_

The TDC Group is subject to the tax legislation in force in the countries where it conducts business.
Consequently, an amendment of the tax and value added tax (VAT) rules in the countries in question may
affect the TDC Group’s payable corporate tax and VAT, and its future results. The TDC Group’s Danish
entities and its jointly-taxed related parties in the Nordic Telephone Company Investment Group are subject
to the Danish rules on limitation of interest deduction. As a consequence of the limitations of interest
deduction between the jointly taxed entities, these rules may lead to unproportional tax consequences
depending on the development in the financial markets.

TDC pursues an active tax policy and evaluates potential tax advantages against potential costs and other
disadvantages. This tax policy implies a natural risk for TDC’s tax position to be challenged by local tax
authorities. Therefore, TDC keeps a well-documented transfer-pricing set-up in accordance with Danish and
international directions as defined by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.

**_Other risks_**

_Risk of loss of important property rights_

Some of the TDC Group’s intellectual property rights, including the TDC Group’s key trademarks and
domain names, which are well known in the telecommunications markets, are vital to the TDC Group’s
business. A significant part of the TDC Group’s revenue is derived from products and services marketed
under the brand names TDC, Sunrise, YouSee, Telmore and Fullrate and the TDC Group relies upon a
combination of trademark laws, copyright and database protection as well as contractual arrangements to
establish and protect its intellectual property rights.

The TDC Group also risks that a third party may claim that the TDC Group is infringing intellectual property
rights, for example, patent rights. As a result, the TDC Group may be unable to use intellectual property that
is material to the operation of its business. Alternatively, a third party may allege that one of the TDC
Group’s suppliers is infringing on such a third party’s intellectual property rights and may take legal action


-----

to prevent such a supplier from providing the TDC Group with products or services important to the TDC
Group’s business.

The TDC Group cannot be sure that any lawsuits, or similar actions initiated to protect its intellectual
property rights will be successful or that its suppliers will be cleared of infringing the intellectual property
rights of third parties. Although the TDC Group is unaware of any material infringements of any intellectual
property rights that are significant to the TDC Group’s business, any lawsuits, regardless of outcome, could
result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. The illegal use by third parties or the loss of the TDC
Group’s important intellectual property rights, such as trademarks and domain names, could also have a
materially adverse effect on the TDC Group’s business, financial position and results of operations. The
TDC Group could also be prevented from using certain products and services or be forced to pay significant
damages or higher prices for important products or services due to a third party’s successful intellectual
property claim, which may affect the TDC Group’s business.

_Risk regarding loss of key technologies_

TDC is licensed to provide mobile telecommunications services in Denmark and in Switzerland. For
example, TDC has UMTS licenses to provide 3G services in Denmark and Switzerland, three global systems
for mobile communications (GSM) licenses in Denmark (including licenses for DCS 1800, DC56 and GSM,
respectively) and one GSM license in Switzerland. TDC’s Danish and Swiss UMTS licenses are valid until
31 October 2021 and 31 December 2016, respectively. TDC’s Danish GSM licenses are valid until 12 June
2017, 1 January 2011 and 1 March 2012, respectively, and TDC’s Swiss GSM license is valid until 31
December 2013. NITA or the Swiss regulator may withdraw existing licenses if TDC cannot meet the license
conditions, including obtaining the regulator’s consent in the event of a change of control. After the expiry
dates, TDC will have to re-apply for a new Danish UMTS license and new Swiss GSM and UMTS licenses.
Any application for renewal of such licenses may be unsuccessful. The three Danish GSM licenses will be
extended automatically for periods of 10 years unless NITA decides otherwise no later than one year before
the scheduled expiry date. In the event that TDC is unable to renew a license or obtain a new license for any
technology that is important for the provision of TDC’s service offerings, the TDC Group could be forced to
stop using that technology and the TDC Group’s financial position and results of operations could be
materially adversely affected.

_Risks regarding alleged health risks from the use of mobile phones and environmental protection legislation_

The TDC Group is subject to regulations and guidelines relating to radio frequency emissions and other nonionizing radiation. Alleged health risks, including some forms of cancer, have been associated with such
emissions from mobile telephones and from other mobile telecommunications devices. The European
Commission has been investigating these concerns since 1995, and although the results of these studies have
been inconclusive, the TDC Group cannot provide assurances that further medical research will not establish
a link between the radio frequency emissions of mobile handsets and health concerns. Consequently, the EU
and Danish or Swiss authorities could increase regulation of mobile phones and base stations. In Switzerland
in particular, public concern over alleged adverse health effects related to electromagnetic radiation, and
strict Swiss rules on radiation may result in increased costs related to the GSM and UMTS networks and may
thereby impede both the continuation of the TDC Group’s 2G and the growth of the TDC Group’s 3G
mobile telephony business.

The actual or perceived risk of mobile telecommunications devices, press reports or litigation relating to such
risks could adversely affect the TDC Group by reducing growth in the TDC Group’s customer base, usage
and ARPU and increasing regulatory burdens on the TDC Group or significant litigation costs.

The TDC Group is also subject to various laws and regulations relating to land use and environmental
protection, including those governing the storage, management and disposal of hazardous materials and
clean-up of contaminated sites. The TDC Group could incur substantial costs, including clean-up costs,


-----

fines, sanctions and third party claims for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of, or
liabilities under, such laws and regulations. However, the TDC Group believes that it is in substantial
compliance with such laws and regulations.

_Risks relating to the review of strategic alternatives for TDC_

There is no guarantee that any outcomes or actions taken from the recently announced review initiated by the
majority shareholder of TDC, Nordic Telephone Company ApS (NTC) to evaluate strategic alternatives for
TDC, will not be adverse to Noteholders and any such actions or outcomes may affect the business,
operations and financing of TDC in the future. At the date of this Prospectus, TDC is unable to assess the
impacts of such a review on the TDC Group, nor can there be any assurances that any particular course of
action will be pursued or what the timing or the terms of such alternatives will be.

_Risks relating to the proposed merger between TDC and NTC_

There is no guarantee that the proposed merger between TDC and NTC, where TDC will be the surviving
entity, will go ahead as proposed as it is conditional upon a final merger resolution to be adopted by the
board of directors of each entity no earlier than four weeks after the Danish Commerce and Companies
Agency has announced its receipt of the merger plan. It is also open to the shareholders representing more
than five per cent. of the shares in TDC to request an extraordinary general meeting before the merger may
be finally approved. There is no assurance that the anticipated benefits of the proposed merger, namely, an
increase in TDC's equity, optimising its capital structure, simplifying TDC's shareholding structure and
minimising costs, will be realised within any given time frame or at all.

**Factors which are material for the purpose of assessing the market risks associated with the Notes**

**_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors_**

Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own
circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

(i) have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Notes, the merits
and risks of investing in the Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this
Prospectus or any applicable supplement;

(ii) have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its
particular financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have on
its overall investment portfolio;

(iii) have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes,
including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential
investor's currency;

(iv) understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant
financial markets; and

(v) be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for
economic, interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the
applicable risks.

_The Notes are subject to optional redemption by the Issuer_

The Notes contain an optional redemption feature, which is likely to limit their market value. During any
period when the Issuer may elect to redeem the Notes, the market value of the Notes generally will not rise


-----

substantially above the price at which they can be redeemed. This also may be true prior to any redemption
period.

The Issuer may be expected to redeem the Notes when its cost of borrowing is lower than the interest rate on
the Notes. At those times, an investor generally would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds at an
effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the Notes being redeemed and may only be able to do so
at a significantly lower rate. Potential investors should consider reinvestment risk in light of other
investments available at that time.

**_Risks related to the Notes generally_**

Set out below is a brief description of certain risks relating to the Notes generally:

_Noteholders have no direct recourse to the Issuer_

In order to have recourse to the Issuer, Noteholders must first direct the Trustee to take enforcement action
against the Issuer in accordance with the Trust Deed. The Trustee shall not be required to act unless it has
been indemnified by the Noteholders to its satisfaction. Noteholders have no direct recourse to the Issuer
unless the Trustee, having become bound so to proceed, fails to do so within a reasonable time and that
failure shall be continuing.

_Modification, waivers and substitution_

The conditions of the Notes contain provisions for calling meetings of Noteholders to consider matters
affecting their interests generally. These provisions permit defined majorities to bind all Noteholders
including Noteholders who did not attend and vote at the relevant meeting and Noteholders who voted in a
manner contrary to the majority.

The conditions of the Notes also provide that the Trustee may, without the consent of Noteholders, agree to
(i) any modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of the
provisions of Notes or (ii) determine without the consent of the Noteholders that any Event of Default or
potential Event of Default shall not be treated as such or (iii) the substitution of another company as principal
debtor under any Notes in place of the Issuer, in the circumstances described in Conditions 14 and 13.

_Because the Notes in global form are held by or on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg,_
_investors will have to rely on their procedures for transfer, payment and communication with the Issuer_

The Notes may be represented by one or more global Notes. Such global Notes will be deposited with a
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. Except in the circumstances described in
such global Notes, investors will not be entitled to receive definitive Notes. Euroclear and Clearstream,
Luxembourg will maintain records of the beneficial interests in the global Notes. While the Notes are
represented by one or more global Notes, investors will be able to trade their beneficial interests only
through Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg. While the Notes are represented by one or more global
Notes the Issuer will discharge its payment obligations under the Notes by making payments to the common
depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg for distribution to their account holders. A holder of
a beneficial interest in a global Note must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg
to receive payments under the relevant Notes. The Issuer has no responsibility or liability for the records
relating to, or payments made in respect of, beneficial interests in the global Notes.

_EU Savings Directive_

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States, including
Belgium from 1 January 2010, are required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details
of payments of interest (or similar income) paid by a person within its jurisdiction to an individual resident in


-----

that other Member State or to certain limited types of entities established in that other Member State.
However, for a transitional period, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during
that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments (the ending of
such transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to
information exchange with certain other countries). A number of non-EU countries and territories including
Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).

On 15 September 2008 the European Commission issued a report to the Council of the European Union on
the operation of the Directive, which included the Commission's advice on the need for changes to the
Directive. On 13 November 2008 the European Commission published a more detailed proposal for
amendments to the Directive, which included a number of suggested changes. If any of those proposed
changes are made in relation to the Directive, they may amend or broaden the scope of the requirements
described above.

If a payment were to be made or collected through a Member State which has opted for a withholding system
and an amount of, or in respect of, tax were to be withheld from that payment, neither the Issuer nor any
Paying Agent nor any other person would be obliged to pay additional amounts with respect to any Note as a
result of the imposition of such withholding tax. The Issuer is required to maintain a Paying Agent in a
Member State that is not obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the Directive.

_Change of law_

The conditions of the Notes are based on English law in effect as at the date of this Prospectus. No
assurance can be given as to the impact of any possible judicial decision or change to English law or
administrative practice after the date of this Prospectus.

_Denominations involve integral multiples: definitive Notes_

The Notes have denominations consisting of a minimum of €50,000 plus one or more higher integral
multiples of €1,000. It is possible that the Notes may be traded in amounts that are not integral multiples of
€50,000. In such a case a holder who, as a result of trading such amounts, holds an amount which is less
than €50,000 in his account with the relevant clearing system at the relevant time may not receive a
definitive Note in respect of such holding (should definitive Notes be printed) and would need to purchase a
principal amount of Notes such that its holding amounts to €50,000.

If definitive Notes are issued, holders should be aware that definitive Notes which have a denomination that
is not an integral multiple of €50,000 may be illiquid and difficult to trade.

**_Risks related to the market generally_**

Set out below is a brief description of the principal market risks, including liquidity risk, exchange rate risk,
interest rate risk and credit risk:

_The secondary market generally_

The Notes may have no established trading market when issued, and one may never develop. If a market
does develop, it may not be very liquid. Therefore, investors may not be able to sell their Notes easily or at
prices that will provide them with a yield comparable to similar investments that have a developed secondary
market. As such, the Notes generally will have a more limited secondary market and more price volatility
than conventional debt securities. Illiquidity may have a severely adverse effect on the market value of
Notes.


-----

_Exchange rate risks and exchange controls_

The Issuer will pay principal and interest on the Notes in euro. This presents certain risks relating to
currency conversions if an investor's financial activities are denominated principally in a currency or
currency unit (the **Investor's Currency) other than euro. These include the risk that exchange rates may**
significantly change (including changes due to devaluation of the euro or revaluation of the Investor's
Currency) and the risk that authorities with jurisdiction over the Investor's Currency may impose or modify
exchange controls. An appreciation in the value of the Investor's Currency relative to euro would decrease
(1) the Investor's Currency-equivalent yield on the Notes, (2) the Investor's Currency-equivalent value of the
principal payable on the Notes and (3) the Investor's Currency-equivalent market value of the Notes.

Government and monetary authorities may impose (as some have done in the past) exchange controls that
could adversely affect an applicable exchange rate. As a result, investors may receive less interest or
principal than expected, or no interest or principal.

_Interest rate risks_

Investment in the Notes involves the risk that subsequent changes in market interest rates may adversely
affect the value of them.

_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks_

Fitch and Moody's have assigned, and S&P is expected to assign, credit ratings to the Notes. The ratings
may not reflect the potential impact of all risks related to structure, market, additional factors discussed
above, and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to
buy, sell or hold securities and may be revised or withdrawn by the rating agency at any time.

**_Legal investment considerations may restrict certain investments_**

The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, or review
or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine
whether and to what extent (1) the Notes are legal investments for it, (2) the Notes can be used as collateral
for various types of borrowing and (3) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of the Notes.
Financial institutions should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the
appropriate treatment of the Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

**THE EXCHANGE OFFER**

On 30 November 2009, the Issuer announced an invitation (the **Exchange Offer) to holders of its**
€750,000,000 6.50 per cent. Notes due 2012 (the **Existing Notes) to offer to exchange any or all of such**
securities for the Notes, subject to the terms and conditions set out in the Exchange Offer Memorandum
dated 30 November 2009.

In connection with the Exchange Offer, the Issuer entered into a dealer manager agreement dated 30
November 2009 with BNP Paribas and Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited (the Dealer Managers),
which contains certain provisions regarding payment for fees, expense reimbursement and indemnity
arrangements.

The Exchange Offer Memorandum does not constitute an offer to sell or buy or the solicitation of an offer to
sell or buy the Existing Notes and/or the Notes, as applicable, and offers of Existing Notes for exchange
pursuant to the Exchange Offer have not been and will not be accepted from persons in any circumstances in
which such offer or solicitation is unlawful. No person in any jurisdiction in which, or from whom, it is
unlawful to make an invitation to participate in the Exchange Offer or for there to be such participation under
applicable securities laws may participate in the Exchange Offer. The distribution of the Exchange Offer
Memorandum in certain jurisdictions may be restricted by law.

No action has been or will be taken in any jurisdiction by the Issuer, the Dealer Managers, the Trustee or
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch as exchange agent for the Exchange Offer, in relation to the Exchange
Offer that would permit a public offering of securities other than in Switzerland.

**CONDITIONS OF THE NOTES**

_The following is the text of the Conditions of the Notes which (subject to modification) will be endorsed on_
_each Note in definitive form (if issued):_

The €273,547,000 5.875 per cent. Notes due 2015 (the **Notes, which expression shall in these Conditions,**
unless the context otherwise requires, include any further notes issued pursuant to Condition 16 and forming
a single series with the Notes) of TDC A/S (the Issuer) are constituted by a Trust Deed dated 16 December
2009 (the **Trust Deed) made between the Issuer and The Law Debenture Trust Corporation p.l.c. (the**
**Trustee, which expression shall include its successor(s)) as trustee for the holders of the Notes (the**
**Noteholders) and the holders of the interest coupons appertaining to the Notes (the Couponholders and the**
**Coupons respectively).**

The statements in these Conditions include summaries of, and are subject to, the detailed provisions of and
definitions in the Trust Deed. Copies of the Trust Deed and the Agency Agreement dated 16 December 2009
(the Agency Agreement) made between the Issuer, the initial Paying Agents and the Trustee are available
for inspection during normal business hours by the Noteholders and the Couponholders at the registered
office for the time being of the Trustee, being at the date of issue of the Notes at Fifth Floor, 100 Wood
Street, London EC2V 7EX and at the specified office of each of the Paying Agents. The Noteholders and the
Couponholders are entitled to the benefit of, are bound by, and are deemed to have notice of, all the
provisions of the Trust Deed and the Agency Agreement applicable to them.

**1.** **FORM, DENOMINATION AND TITLE**

**1.1** **Form and Denomination**

The Notes are in bearer form, serially numbered, in denominations of €50,000 and integral multiples
of €1,000 in excess thereof up to and including €99,000, each with Coupons attached on issue. No

exchanged for Notes of the other denomination.

**1.2** **Title**

Title to the Notes and to the Coupons will pass by delivery.

**1.3** **Holder Absolute Owner**

The Issuer, any Paying Agent and the Trustee may (to the fullest extent permitted by applicable

(whether or not the Note or Coupon shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or
writing on the Note or Coupon or any notice of previous loss or theft of the Note or Coupon or of
any trust or interest therein) and shall not be required to obtain any proof thereof or as to the identity
of such bearer.

**2.** **STATUS**

The Notes and the Coupons relating to them constitute (subject to Condition 3) unsecured
obligations of the Issuer and shall at all times rank _pari passu and without any preference among_
themselves. The payment obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Coupons relating to them
shall, save for such exceptions as may be provided by applicable legislation and subject to Condition
3, at all times rank at least equally with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness and
monetary obligations of the Issuer, present and future.


-----

**3.** **NEGATIVE PLEDGE**

**3.1** **Restriction**

So long as any of the Notes or Coupons remains outstanding (as defined in the Trust Deed), the

as provided in Condition 3.3) create or permit to subsist any mortgage, charge, pledge, lien or other
form of encumbrance or security interest (Security) upon the whole or any part of its undertaking,
assets or revenues present or future to secure any Relevant Debt, or any guarantee of or indemnity in
respect of any Relevant Debt unless, at the same time or prior thereto, the Issuer's obligations under
the Notes, the Coupons and the Trust Deed (a) are secured equally and rateably therewith, or (b)
have the benefit of such other security or other arrangement as the Trustee in its absolute discretion
shall deem to be not materially less beneficial to interests of the Noteholders or as shall be approved
by an Extraordinary Resolution (as defined in the Trust Deed) of the Noteholders.

The prohibition contained in this Condition 3 does not apply to:

(a) Security created in connection with a project financing where the Issuer does not have any
liability, actual or contingent, in respect of the obligations of the project or the company
raising the finance. The Security permitted by this sub-paragraph must be limited to the
assets of the project being financed or the shares of the company raising the finance;

(b) Security arising in the ordinary course of banking transactions including sale and repurchase
agreements and share, loan and bond lending transactions provided that any such
transactions are for the purpose of financing or refinancing the assets which are the subject
of the Security;

(c) Security existing in connection with Relevant Debt which is assumed by the Issuer or any
relevant Principal Subsidiary at the time of the assumption or existing prior to an entity
(whether or not a Subsidiary (as defined in Condition 9)) becoming a Principal Subsidiary;
or

(d) Security arising in respect of financial lease transactions provided that any such transactions
are for the purpose of financing or refinancing the assets which are the subject of the
Security.

**3.2** **Relevant Debt**

For the purposes of this Condition, Relevant Debt means any present or future indebtedness in the
form of, or represented by, any bond, note, debenture, debenture stock, loan stock, certificate or
other instrument which is for the time being, or is capable of being, quoted, listed or traded on any
stock exchange or in any over-the-counter or other securities market.

**3.3** **Note**

The prohibition contained in this Condition 3 shall apply to a Principal Subsidiary only to prohibit a
Principal Subsidiary from creating or permitting to subsist Security which secures Relevant Debt of
the Issuer or a guarantee or indemnity given by the Issuer in respect of Relevant Debt and not
otherwise.


-----

**4.** **INTEREST**

**4.1** **Interest Rate and Interest Payment Dates**

The Notes bear interest on their outstanding principal amount from and including 16 December 2009

December 2010.

**4.2** **Interest Accrual**

Each Note will cease to bear interest from and including its due date for redemption unless, upon due
presentation, payment of the principal in respect of the Note is improperly withheld or refused or
unless default is otherwise made in respect of payment, in which event interest shall continue to
accrue as provided in the Trust Deed.

**4.3** **Calculation of Broken Interest**

When interest is required to be calculated in respect of a period of less than a full year, it shall be
calculated on the basis of (a) the actual number of days in the period from and including the date
from which interest begins to accrue (the Accrual Date) to but excluding the date on which it falls
due divided by (b) the actual number of days from and including the Accrual Date to but excluding
the next following Interest Payment Date.

**5.** **PAYMENTS**

**5.1** **Payments in respect of Notes**

Payments of principal and interest in respect of each Note will be made against presentation and
surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of the Note, except that payments of
interest due on an Interest Payment Date will be made against presentation and surrender (or, in the
case of part payment only, endorsement) of the relevant Coupon, in each case at the specified office
outside the United States of any of the Paying Agents.

**5.2** **Method of Payment**

Payments will be made by credit or transfer to a euro account (or any other account to which euro
may be credited or transferred) specified by the payee or, at the option of the payee, by euro cheque.

**5.3** **Missing Unmatured Coupons**

Each Note should be presented for payment together with all relative unmatured Coupons, failing
which the full amount of any relative missing unmatured Coupon (or, in the case of payment not
being made in full, that proportion of the full amount of the missing unmatured Coupon which the
amount so paid bears to the total amount due) will be deducted from the amount due for payment.
Each amount so deducted will be paid in the manner mentioned above against presentation and
surrender (or, in the case of part payment only, endorsement) of the relative missing Coupon at any
time before the expiry of 10 years after the Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 7) in respect of
the relevant Note (whether or not the Coupon would otherwise have become void pursuant to
Condition 8) but not thereafter.


-----

**5.4** **Payments subject to Applicable Laws**

Payments in respect of principal and interest on the Notes are subject in all cases to any fiscal or
other laws and regulations applicable in the place of payment, but without prejudice to the provisions
of Condition 7.

**5.5** **Payment only on a Presentation Date**

A holder shall be entitled to present a Note or Coupon for payment only on a Presentation Date and

Presentation Date is after the due date.

**Presentation Date means a day which (subject to Condition 8):**

other Paying Agents provided that:

(a) there will at all times be a Principal Paying Agent;

order to conform to, such Directive; and

(d) there will at all times be such other Paying Agents as may be required by any other stock

**6.** **REDEMPTION AND PURCHASE**

**6.1** **Redemption at Maturity**

Unless previously redeemed or purchased and cancelled as provided below, the Issuer will redeem
the Notes at their principal amount on 16 December 2015.

**6.2** **Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

If the Issuer satisfies the Trustee immediately before the giving of the notice referred to below that:

(a) as a result of any change in, or amendment to, the laws or regulations of a Relevant
Jurisdiction (as defined in Condition 7), or any change in the application or official
interpretation of the laws or regulations of a Relevant Jurisdiction, which change or
amendment becomes effective after 16 December 2009, on the next Interest Payment Date
the Issuer would be required to pay additional amounts as provided or referred to in
Condition 7; and

(b) the requirement cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable measures available to it,

the Issuer may at its option, having given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to the
Noteholders in accordance with Condition 12 (which notice shall be irrevocable), redeem all the
Notes, but not some only, at any time at their principal amount together with interest accrued to but
excluding the date of redemption, provided that no such notice of redemption shall be given earlier
than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer would be required to pay such additional
amounts, were a payment in respect of the Notes then due. Prior to the publication of any notice of
redemption pursuant to this paragraph, the Issuer shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate signed by
two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer stating that the requirement referred to in (a) above will
apply on the next Interest Payment Date and cannot be avoided by the Issuer taking reasonable
measures available to it, and the Trustee shall be entitled to accept the certificate as sufficient
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent set out above, in which event it shall be
conclusive and binding on the Noteholders and the Couponholders.

**6.3** **Redemption at the Option of the Issuer**

The Issuer may, having given:

(a) not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' notice to the Noteholders in accordance with
Condition 12; and

(which notices shall be irrevocable and shall specify the date fixed for redemption), redeem all (but
not some only) of the Notes, on the redemption date specified in such notice at the Issuer
Redemption Price together with interest accrued to but excluding the date of redemption.

For the purposes of this Condition:

**Adjusted Comparable Yield means, with respect to any redemption date, the rate per annum equal**
to the equivalent yield to maturity of the Comparable Issue plus the Comparable Issue Margin. For
these purposes, the price of the Comparable Issue will be calculated by the Special Calculation
Agent, with respect to any redemption date, as being the average of the Quotation Agents'
Quotations for such redemption date;


-----

**Comparable Issue means the 3.25 per cent. Bundesrepublik Deutschland Bundesobligationen due**
July 2015 (WKN: 113528) or, should such issue no longer be in issue, the Comparable Issue shall be
such other securities as the Trustee, on the advice of an investment bank or broker of recognised
standing operating in the euro market as selected by the Issuer and approved by the Trustee, may
determine;

**Comparable Issue Margin means 0.25 per cent., provided however that, should the Comparable**
Issue specified above be replaced in the manner specified herein, the Comparable Issue Margin shall
also be such other margin as the Trustee, on the advice of an investment bank or broker of
recognised standing operating in the relevant currency market as selected by the Issuer and approved
by the Trustee, may determine;

**Issuer Redemption Price means (i) 100 per cent. of the outstanding nominal amount of the Notes,**
plus accrued interest to the date of redemption or, if greater, (ii) as determined by the Special
Calculation Agent, the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal
and interest on the Notes (not including any portion of such payments of interest accrued as of the
date of redemption). The present values will be determined by discounting the remaining principal
and interest payments to the original redemption date using the Adjusted Comparable Yield. The
Special Calculation Agent shall advise the Principal Paying Agent and the Trustee of the Issuer
Redemption Price as so calculated;

**Quotation Agents means a group of at least four reference dealers that are primary dealers in the**
Comparable Issue. The Special Calculation Agent will appoint the Quotation Agents after first
consulting with the Issuer;

**Quotation Agents' Quotations means, with respect to any redemption date, the average, as**
determined by the Special Calculation Agent, of the bid and offer prices for the Comparable Issue
(expressed in each case as a percentage of its outstanding nominal amount) quoted in writing to the
Special Calculation Agent by the Quotation Agents at 5.00 p.m. (London time) on the fifth Business
Day (as defined in Condition 5.3) in London before the redemption date;

**Special Calculation Agent** means an investment bank of international repute, as selected by the
Issuer and approved by the Trustee, appointed by the Issuer for the purposes of calculating the Issuer
Redemption Price.

**6.4** **Purchases**

The Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries (as defined above) may at any time purchase Notes (provided
that all unmatured Coupons appertaining to the Notes are purchased with the Notes) in any manner
and at any price.

**6.5** **Cancellations**

All Notes which are (a) purchased by or on behalf of the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may (at the
option of the Issuer or the relevant Subsidiary), or (b) redeemed shall, forthwith be cancelled,
together with all relative unmatured Coupons attached to the Notes or surrendered with the Notes,
and accordingly may not be held, reissued or resold.

**6.6** **Notices Final**

Upon the expiry of any notice as is referred to in paragraph 6.2 or 6.3 above the Issuer shall be
bound to redeem the Notes to which the notice refers in accordance with the terms of such
paragraph.


-----

**7.** **TAXATION**

**7.1** **Payment without Withholding**

All payments in respect of the Notes by or on behalf of the Issuer shall be made without withholding
or deduction for, or on account of, any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental
charges of whatever nature (Taxes) imposed or levied by or on behalf of the Relevant Jurisdiction,
unless the withholding or deduction of the Taxes is required by law. In that event, the Issuer will pay
such additional amounts as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received by the
Noteholders and Couponholders after the withholding or deduction shall equal the respective
amounts which would have been receivable in respect of the Notes or, as the case may be, Coupons
in the absence of the withholding or deduction; except that no additional amounts shall be payable in
relation to any payment in respect of any Note or Coupon:

(a) presented for payment by or on behalf of a holder who is liable to the Taxes in respect of the
Note or Coupon by reason of his having some connection with the Relevant Jurisdiction
other than the mere holding of the Note or Coupon; or

(b) where such withholding or deduction is imposed on a payment to an individual and is
required to be made pursuant to European Council Directive 2003/48/EC or any law
implementing or complying with, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive; or

(c) presented for payment by or on behalf of a holder who would have been able to avoid such
withholding or deduction by presenting the relevant Note or Coupon to another Paying
Agent in a Member State of the European Union; or

(d) presented for payment more than 30 days after the Relevant Date (as defined below) except
to the extent that a holder would have been entitled to additional amounts on presenting the
same for payment on the last day of the period of 30 days assuming, whether or not such is
in fact the case, that date to have been a Presentation Date (as defined in Condition 5).

**7.2** **Interpretation**

In these Conditions:

(a) **Relevant Date means the date on which the payment first becomes due but, if the full**
amount of the money payable has not been received by the Principal Paying Agent or the
Trustee on or before the due date, it means the date on which, the full amount of the money
having been so received, notice to that effect has been duly given to the Noteholders by the
Issuer in accordance with Condition 12; and

(b) **Relevant Jurisdiction means the Kingdom of Denmark or any political subdivision or any**
authority thereof or therein having power to tax or any other jurisdiction or any political
subdivision or any authority thereof or therein having power to tax to which the Issuer
becomes subject in respect of payments made by it of principal and interest on the Notes and
Coupons.

**7.3** **Additional Amounts**

Any reference in these Conditions to any amounts in respect of the Notes shall be deemed also to
refer to any additional amounts which may be payable under this Condition or under any
undertakings given in addition to, or in substitution for, this Condition pursuant to the Trust Deed.


-----

**8.** **PRESCRIPTION**

Notes and Coupons will become void unless presented for payment within periods of 10 years (in the
case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest) from the Relevant Date in respect of the
Notes or, as the case may be, the Coupons, subject to the provisions of Condition 5.

**9.** **EVENTS OF DEFAULT**

**9.1** **Events of Default**

If any of the following events (Events of Default) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee (subject in
each case to it being indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its satisfaction) at its discretion

Notes are, and they shall immediately become, due and payable at their principal amount together
with accrued interest as provided in the Trust Deed:

(a) default is made for more than 14 days (in the case of interest) or seven days (in the case of
principal) in the payment on the due date of any amounts in respect of any of the Notes; or

(b) the Issuer does not perform or comply with any one or more of its other obligations in the
Notes or the Trust Deed which default is incapable of remedy or, if in the opinion of the
Trustee capable of remedy, is not in the opinion of the Trustee remedied within 30 days (or
such longer period as the Trustee may permit) after notice of such default shall have been
given to the Issuer by the Trustee; or

(c) (i) any other present or future indebtedness of the Issuer for or in respect of moneys
borrowed or raised becomes due and payable prior to its stated maturity by reason of any
default on the part of the Issuer (provided that any applicable grace period has expired), or
(ii) any such indebtedness of the Issuer or of any of its Principal Subsidiaries is not paid
when due or, as the case may be, within any applicable grace period, or (iii) the Issuer or any
of its Principal Subsidiaries fails to pay when due or, as the case may be, within any
applicable grace period any amount payable by it under any present or future guarantee for,
or indemnity in respect of, any moneys borrowed or raised, or (iv) any mortgage, charge,
pledge, lien or other encumbrance, present or future, created or assumed by the Issuer or any
of its Principal Subsidiaries becomes enforceable and any step is taken to enforce it
(including the taking of possession or the appointment of a receiver, manager or other
similar person),

_provided that:_

(A) the aggregate amount of the indebtedness, guarantees, indemnities or indebtedness
secured by such mortgage, charge, pledge, lien or other encumbrance in respect of
which one or more of the events mentioned above in sub-paragraphs (i) to (iv) have
occurred equals or exceeds U.S.$25,000,000 or its equivalent in other currencies (as
determined by the Trustee); and

(B) in the case of the occurrence of one or more of such events in respect of a Principal
Subsidiary that the Issuer has not within seven days after the relevant event
discharged the relevant indebtedness, guarantee or indemnity on behalf of the
relevant Principal Subsidiary; and

(C) payment of such indebtedness referred to in sub-paragraphs (i) and (ii) and payment
under such guarantee or indemnity referred to in sub-paragraph (iii) shall not have


-----

been disputed in good faith by the Issuer or the relevant Principal Subsidiary as the
case may be; or

(d) a distress, attachment, execution or other legal process is levied or enforced on or against
any (in the opinion of the Trustee) material part of the property, assets or revenues of the

_provided that in the case of a default by the Principal Subsidiary which is the subject of such_
event, such default is not in the opinion of the Trustee remedied within 14 days after notice
of such default shall have been given to the Issuer by the Trustee; or

(e) the Issuer is (or is deemed by a court to be) insolvent (meaning that its total liabilities exceed
its total assets) or the Issuer or any of its Principal Subsidiaries is (or is deemed by a court to
be) bankrupt or unable to pay its debts, stops, suspends or threatens to stop or suspend
payment of all or (in the opinion of the Trustee) a material part of its debts, proposes or
makes a general assignment or an arrangement or composition with or for the benefit of the

Issuer or any of its Principal Subsidiaries; or

(f) an order is made or an effective resolution passed for the winding-up or dissolution of the

or through an official action of its board of directors threatens to cease to carry on (either
directly or through one or more Subsidiaries or Affiliates) a substantial part of its business or
operations, in each case except for the purpose of and followed by a reconstruction,
amalgamation, reorganisation, merger, consolidation or disposal (i) where immediately
following such reconstruction, amalgamation, reorganisation, merger, consolidation or
disposal, any of the then current credit ratings assigned to the Issuer or any successor to the
Issuer is not lower primarily as a direct result of such reconstruction, amalgamation,
reorganisation, merger, consolidation or disposal or (ii) on terms approved by the Trustee or
by an Extraordinary Resolution (as defined in the Trust Deed) of the Noteholders or (iii) in

purposes of this Condition 9.1(f), a **substantial part of its business or operations shall**
mean all or a part of the business or operations of the relevant company (as the
circumstances may require) which in either case represents over three quarters of the
consolidated total assets of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as certified by
two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer and calculated on the basis of the then most recent
consolidated accounts of the Issuer (whether audited or unaudited) that are available to the
public; or

(g) any event occurs that under the laws of any relevant jurisdiction has an analogous effect to
any of the events referred to in any of the foregoing paragraphs,

provided that in the case of each of paragraphs (b), (d), (e) and (f) the Trustee shall have first
certified that in its opinion such event is materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders.

**9.2** **Interpretation**

For the purposes of these Conditions:

(a) **Affiliates means in relation to any person (i) any entity controlled, directly or indirectly, by**
that person, (ii) any entity that controls, directly or indirectly, that person, or (iii) any entity


-----

directly or indirectly under common control with that person. For this purpose, control of
any entity or person means ownership or control of at least 20 per cent. of the voting rights
of that entity or person.

(b) **Principal Subsidiary means any Subsidiary of the Issuer the total assets or revenues of**
which equal or exceed 10 per cent. of the consolidated total assets or consolidated total
revenues of the Issuer. These figures will be calculated on the basis of the then most recent
consolidated accounts of the Issuer (whether audited or unaudited) that are available to the
public and the then most recent audited financial statements of the relevant Subsidiary
(whether or not it was a Subsidiary at the time of their preparation). If a Subsidiary prepares
consolidated accounts, those accounts will be used.

A report by two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer that, in their opinion, a Subsidiary of
the Issuer is or is not or was or was not at any particular time or throughout any specified
period a Principal Subsidiary shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and
binding on all parties.

(c) **Subsidiary shall have the meaning given thereto in the Trust Deed.**

**10.** **ENFORCEMENT**

**10.1** **Enforcement by the Trustee**

The Trustee may at any time, at its discretion and without notice, take such proceedings against the
Issuer as it may think fit to enforce the provisions of the Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons, but
it shall not be bound to take any such proceedings or any other action in relation to the Trust Deed,
the Notes or the Coupons unless (a) it has been so directed by an Extraordinary Resolution of the
Noteholders or so requested in writing by the holders of at least one-fifth in principal amount of the
Notes then outstanding and (b) it has been indemnified and/or secured and/or prefunded to its
satisfaction.

**10.2** **Enforcement by the Noteholders**

No Noteholder or Couponholder shall be entitled to proceed directly against the Issuer unless the
Trustee, having become bound so to proceed, fails so to do within a reasonable period and the failure
shall be continuing.

**11.** **REPLACEMENT OF NOTES AND COUPONS**

Should any Note or Coupon be lost, stolen, mutilated, defaced or destroyed it may be replaced at the
specified office of the Principal Paying Agent or the Paying Agent in Luxembourg, or such other
Paying Agent as may from time to time be designated by the Issuer for the purpose and notice of
whose designation is given to the Noteholders, upon payment by the claimant of the expenses
incurred in connection with the replacement and on such terms as to evidence and indemnity as the
Issuer may reasonably require. Mutilated or defaced Notes or Coupons must be surrendered before
replacements will be issued.

Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the rules of that exchange so require, in one daily newspaper
published in Luxembourg approved by the Trustee and/or on the website of the Luxembourg Stock


-----

Exchange at www.bourse.lu. It is expected that publication will normally be made in the Financial
_Times and (where applicable) the Luxemburger Wort or the Tageblatt. The Issuer shall also ensure_
that notices are duly published in a manner which complies with the rules and regulations of any
stock exchange or the relevant authority on which the Notes are for the time being listed. Any such
notice will be deemed to have been given on the date of the first publication or, where required to be
published in more than one newspaper, on the date of the first publication in all required newspapers.
If publication as provided above is not practicable, notice will be given in such other manner, and
shall be deemed to have been given on such date, as the Trustee may approve. Couponholders will
be deemed for all purposes to have notice of the contents of any notice given to the Noteholders in
accordance with this paragraph.

**13.** **SUBSTITUTION**

The Trustee may, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, agree with the Issuer to
the substitution in place of the Issuer (or of any previous substitute under this Condition) as the
principal debtor under the Notes, the Coupons and the Trust Deed of any other company being a
Subsidiary of the Issuer (such substituted company being hereinafter called the **New Company),**
subject to:

(a) the Trustee being satisfied that the interests of the Noteholders will not be materially
prejudiced by the substitution; and

(b) certain other conditions set out in the Trust Deed being complied with.

Not later than 14 days after the compliance with the relevant requirements, the New Company shall
give notice thereof in a form previously approved by the Trustee to the Noteholders in the manner
provided in Condition 12.

of any of these Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed. The quorum at any meeting
for passing an Extraordinary Resolution will be two or more persons present holding or representing
a clear majority in principal amount of the Notes for the time being outstanding, or at any adjourned
such meeting two or more persons present whatever the principal amount of the Notes held or
represented by them, except that, at any meeting the business of which includes the modification or
abrogation of certain of the provisions of these Conditions and certain of the provisions of the Trust
Deed, the necessary quorum for passing an Extraordinary Resolution will be two or more persons
present holding or representing not less than 75 per cent., or at any adjourned such meeting not less

The Trustee may agree, without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders, to any
modification of, or to the waiver or authorisation of any breach or proposed breach of, any of these
Conditions or any of the provisions of the Trust Deed, or determine, without any such consent as
aforesaid, that any Event of Default or Potential Event of Default (as defined in the Trust Deed) shall
not be treated as such (provided that, in any such case, it is not, in the opinion of the Trustee,


-----

materially prejudicial to the interests of the Noteholders) or may agree, without any such consent as
aforesaid, to any modification which, in its opinion, is of a formal, minor or technical nature or to
correct a manifest error.

**14.3** **Trustee to have Regard to Interests of Noteholders as a Class**

In connection with the exercise by it of any of its trusts, powers, authorities and discretions
(including, without limitation, any modification, waiver, authorisation, determination or
substitution), the Trustee shall have regard to the general interests of the Noteholders as a class but
shall not have regard to any interests arising from circumstances particular to individual Noteholders
or Couponholders (whatever their number) and, in particular but without limitation, shall not have
regard to the consequences of any such exercise for individual Noteholders or Couponholders
(whatever their number) resulting from their being for any purpose domiciled or resident in, or
otherwise connected with, or subject to the jurisdiction of, any particular territory or any political
sub-division thereof and the Trustee shall not be entitled to require, nor shall any Noteholder or
Couponholder be entitled to claim, from the Issuer, the Trustee or any other person any
indemnification or payment in respect of any tax consequence of any such exercise upon individual
Noteholders or Couponholders except to the extent already provided for in Condition 7 and/or any
undertaking given in addition to, or in substitution for, Condition 7 pursuant to the Trust Deed.

**14.4** **Notification to the Noteholders**

Any modification, abrogation, waiver, authorisation, determination or substitution shall be binding
on the Noteholders and the Couponholders and, unless the Trustee agrees otherwise, any
modification or substitution shall be notified by the Issuer to the Noteholders as soon as practicable
thereafter in accordance with Condition 12.

**15.** **INDEMNIFICATION OF THE TRUSTEE AND ITS CONTRACTING WITH THE ISSUER**

and/or prefunded to its satisfaction.

**15.2** **Trustee Contracting with the Issuer**

The Trust Deed also contains provisions pursuant to which the Trustee is entitled, inter alia, (a) to
enter into business transactions with the Issuer and/or any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries and to act as
trustee for the holders of any other securities issued or guaranteed by, or relating to, the Issuer and/or
any of the Issuer's Subsidiaries, (b) to exercise and enforce its rights, comply with its obligations and
perform its duties under or in relation to any such transactions or, as the case may be, any such
trusteeship without regard to the interests of, or consequences for, the Noteholders or
Couponholders, and (c) to retain and not be liable to account for any profit made or any other
amount or benefit received thereby or in connection therewith.

**16.** **FURTHER ISSUES**

The Issuer is at liberty from time to time without the consent of the Noteholders or Couponholders to
create and issue further notes or bonds (whether in bearer or registered form) either (a) ranking pari
_passu in all respects (or in all respects save for the first payment of interest thereon) and so that the_
same shall be consolidated and form a single series with the outstanding notes or bonds of any series
(including the Notes) constituted by the Trust Deed or any supplemental deed or (b) upon such terms
as to ranking, interest, conversion, redemption and otherwise as the Issuer may determine at the time


-----

of the issue. Any further notes or bonds which are to form a single series with the outstanding notes
or bonds of any series (including the Notes) constituted by the Trust Deed or any supplemental deed
shall, and any other further notes or bonds may (with the consent of the Trustee), be constituted by a
deed supplemental to the Trust Deed. The Trust Deed contains provisions for convening a single
meeting of the Noteholders and the holders of notes or bonds of other series in certain circumstances
where the Trustee so decides.

**17.** **GOVERNING LAW AND SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION**

**17.1** **Governing Law**

The Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons, and any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in
connection with the Trust Deed, the Notes and the Coupons, are governed by, and will be construed
in accordance with, English law.

**17.2** **Jurisdiction of English Courts**

The Issuer has, in the Trust Deed, irrevocably agreed for the benefit of the Trustee, the Noteholders
and the Couponholders that the courts of England are to have exclusive jurisdiction to settle any
disputes which may arise out of or in connection with the Trust Deed, the Notes or the Coupons
(including any dispute relating to any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection
with the Trust Deed, the Notes or the Coupons) and accordingly has submitted to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the English courts.

The Issuer has, in the Trust Deed, waived any objection to the courts of England on the grounds that
they are an inconvenient or inappropriate forum. The Trustee, the Noteholders and the
Couponholders may take any suit, action or proceeding (together referred to as Proceedings) arising
out of or in connection with the Trust Deed, the Notes or the Coupons respectively (including any
Proceedings relating to any non-contractual obligations arising out of or in connection with the Trust
Deed, the Notes or the Coupons) against the Issuer in any other court of competent jurisdiction and
concurrent Proceedings in any number of jurisdictions.

**17.3** **Appointment of Process Agent**

The Issuer has, in the Trust Deed, irrevocably and unconditionally appointed Wilmington Trust SP
Services (London) Limited at the latter's registered office for the time being as its agent for service
of process in England in respect of any Proceedings and has undertaken that in the event of such
agent ceasing so to act it will appoint such other person as the Trustee may approve as its agent for
that purpose.

**18.** **RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES**

No rights are conferred on any person under the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 to
enforce any term of this Note, but this does not affect any right or remedy of any person which exists
or is available apart from that Act.

**SUMMARY OF PROVISIONS RELATING TO THE NOTES WHILE REPRESENTED BY THE**
**GLOBAL NOTES**

_The following is a summary of the provisions to be contained in the Trust Deed to constitute the Notes and in_
_the Global Notes which will apply to, and in some cases modify, the Conditions of the Notes while the Notes_
_are represented by the Global Notes._

**1.** **Exchange**

The Permanent Global Note will be exchangeable in whole but not in part (free of charge to the
holder) for definitive Notes only:

(a) upon the happening of any of the events defined in the Trust Deed as "Events of Default";

(b) if either Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg is closed for business for a continuous
period of 14 days (other than by reason of holiday, statutory or otherwise) or announces an
intention permanently to cease business or does in fact do so and no alternative clearing
system satisfactory to the Trustee is available; or

(c) if the Issuer would suffer a disadvantage as a result of a change in laws or regulations
(taxation or otherwise) or as a result of a change in the practice of Euroclear and/or
Clearstream, Luxembourg which would not be suffered were the Notes in definitive form
and a certificate to such effect signed by two Authorised Signatories of the Issuer is given to
the Trustee.

Thereupon (in the case of (a) and (b) above) the holder of the Permanent Global Note (acting on the
instructions of one or more of the Accountholders (as defined below)) or the Trustee may give notice
to the Issuer and (in the case of (c) above) the Issuer may give notice to the Trustee and the
Noteholders, of its intention to exchange the Permanent Global Note for definitive Notes on or after
the Exchange Date (as defined below).

On or after the Exchange Date the holder of the Permanent Global Note may or, in the case of (c)
above, shall surrender the Permanent Global Note to or to the order of the Principal Paying Agent.
In exchange for the Permanent Global Note the Issuer will deliver, or procure the delivery of, an
equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Notes (having attached to them all Coupons in respect
of interest which has not already been paid on the Permanent Global Note), security printed in
accordance with any applicable legal and stock exchange requirements and in or substantially in the
form set out in the Trust Deed. On exchange of the Permanent Global Note, the Issuer will procure
that it is cancelled and, if the holder so requests, returned to the holder together with any relevant
definitive Notes.

For these purposes, Exchange Date means a day specified in the notice requiring exchange falling
not less than 60 days after that on which such notice is given and being a day on which banks are
open for general business in the place in which the specified office of the Principal Paying Agent is
located and, except in the case of exchange pursuant to (b) above, in the place in which the relevant
clearing system is located.

**2.** **Payments**

On and after 26 January 2010, no payment will be made on the Temporary Global Note unless
exchange for an interest in the Permanent Global Note is improperly withheld or refused. Payments
of principal and interest in respect of Notes represented by a Global Note will, subject as set out
below, be made to the bearer of such Global Note and, if no further payment falls to be made in


-----

respect of the Notes, against surrender of such Global Note to the order of the Principal Paying
Agent or such other Paying Agent as shall have been notified to the Noteholders for such purposes.
A record of each payment made will be endorsed on the appropriate part of the schedule to the
relevant Global Note by or on behalf of the Principal Paying Agent, which endorsement shall be
_prima facie evidence that such payment has been made in respect of the Notes. Payments of interest_
on the Temporary Global Note (if permitted by the first sentence of this paragraph) will be made
only upon certification as to non-U.S. beneficial ownership unless such certification has already been
made.

**3.** **Notices**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global
Note(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, notices to Noteholders
may be given by delivery of the relevant notice to Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the
case may be) for communication to the relative Accountholders rather than by publication as
required by Condition 12, provided that, so long as the Notes are listed on the Luxembourg Stock
Exchange, notice will also be given by publication in a daily newspaper published in Luxembourg
and/or on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange at www.bourse.lu if and to the extent that
the rules of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange so require. Any such notice shall be deemed to have
been given to the Noteholders on the second day after the day on which such notice is delivered to
Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg (as the case may be) as aforesaid.

**4.** **Accountholders**

For so long as all of the Notes are represented by one or both of the Global Notes and such Global
Note(s) is/are held on behalf of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, Luxembourg, each person (other than
Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg) who is for the time being shown in the records of Euroclear
or Clearstream, Luxembourg as the holder of a particular principal amount of such Notes (each an
**Accountholder) (in which regard any certificate or other document issued by Euroclear or**
Clearstream, Luxembourg as to the principal amount of such Notes standing to the account of any
person shall, in the absence of manifest error, be conclusive and binding for all purposes) shall be
treated as the holder of such principal amount of such Notes for all purposes (including but not
limited to, for the purposes of any quorum requirements of, or the right to demand a poll at, meetings
of the Noteholders and giving notice to the Issuer pursuant to Condition 9) other than with respect to
the payment of principal and interest on such principal amount of such Notes, the right to which
shall be vested, as against the Issuer and the Trustee, solely in the bearer of the relevant Global Note
in accordance with and subject to its terms and the terms of the Trust Deed. Each Accountholder
must look solely to Euroclear or Clearstream, Luxembourg, as the case may be, for its share of each
payment made to the bearer of the relevant Global Note.

**5.** **Prescription**

Claims against the Issuer in respect of principal and interest on the Notes represented by a Global
Note will be prescribed after 10 years (in the case of principal) and five years (in the case of interest)
from the Relevant Date (as defined in Condition 7).

**6.** **Cancellation**

Cancellation of any Note represented by a Global Note and required by the Conditions of the Notes
to be cancelled following its redemption or purchase will be effected by endorsement by or on behalf
of the Principal Paying Agent of the reduction in the principal amount of the relevant Global Note on
the relevant part of the schedule thereto.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUER**

**History and Development**

TDC is a Danish-based European full-service provider of communications solutions. TDC is the leading
provider of telecommunications solutions in Denmark, the second-largest full-range telecommunications
provider in the Swiss market (both measured by total revenue) and is represented in the pan-Nordic market.

The Issuer's legal and commercial names are TDC A/S and TDC, respectively. The Issuer was incorporated
as an "aktieselskab" (public limited liability company) on 14 November 1990 and is organised under the laws
of the Kingdom of Denmark (its Central Business Registration number in Denmark is 1477 3908). The Issuer
is headquartered at Teglholmsgade 1 - 3, DK-0900 Copenhagen C, Denmark (telephone: +45 66 63 77 77).
TDC’s shares are listed on the Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen Exchange (ISIN DK00 1025333 5).

The objects of the Issuer are to conduct business within communications, services, directories, media,
investment, financing, advisory services, trade and any other related business, whether in Denmark or
abroad, if appropriate in the form of joint ventures with other Danish or foreign-based companies, as
specified in paragraph 3 of the Issuer's Articles of Association. The Issuer's current Articles of Association
were adopted by the Issuer's annual general meeting on 19 March 2009.

TDC was partly privatized in 1994 and fully privatized in 1998. TDC's current majority shareholder, NTC
(prior to the proposed merger – see "Proposed TDC merger with NTC" further below in Recent Events), is –
through a number of holding companies – ultimately controlled by investment funds, each of which is
advised or managed, directly or indirectly, by Apax Partners Worldwide LLP, The Blackstone Group
International Limited, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P., Permira Advisers KB or Providence Equity
Partners Limited.

**Recent Events**

_Changes to organisational structure_

On 5 February 2009, TDC announced a change to the organisational structure of the TDC Group to a
customer-centric rather than a technology-centric organisation. Following the change of the organisational
structure, the TDC Group was organized in the following business lines: Consumer, Business Nordic,
Operations & Wholesale (responsible for sales to wholesale customers, networks, IT and operations), the
wholly-owned subsidiaries YouSee and Sunrise (also see "Business combination of Sunrise and Orange in
_Switzerland" further below in Recent Events), and Headquarters. The previous business lines, Fixnet Nordic_
and Mobile Nordic, were dissolved and their operations have been incorporated into the new business lines.
On 23 September 2009, a restructuring of Business Nordic was announced, with the Business Nordic
business line being further divided into TDC Business and TDC Nordic.

_Acquisition of Fullrate A/S and A+_

In March 2009, TDC acquired Fullrate A/S, a leading low price broadband and VoIP provider also providing
mobile broadband. In June 2009, TDC acquired A+, a TV and broadband service provider.

_Sale of TDC's shares in Invitel_

At the end of September 2009, the Issuer announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell its 64.6 per
cent. shareholding in Invitel Holdings A/S (Invitel) to the Central and Eastern European equity fund Mid
Europa Partners. Invitel (formerly known as Hungarian Telephone and Cable Corporation (HTCC)) is a
Hungarian based fixed line operator with wholesale operations in Eastern Europe. Invitel's operations were
re-classified to “Discontinued operations” in TDC's consolidated financial statements as of June 2009, and


-----

the sale is part of TDC's strategy to dispose of non-core assets and will not have any impact on the operations
of TDC. The sale was completed in the fourth quarter of 2009.

_Acquisition of Dong Fiber_

On 17 November 2009 TDC and Dong Energy entered into an agreement regarding TDC's acquisition of 100
per cent. of the share capital of Fiber Newco A/S, a newly established company to which Dong Energy
simultaneously transfers all of its activities relating to the roll out and operation of fibernet in Greater
Copenhagen and Northern Zealand. The agreement is expected to be closed before the end of 2009.

_Review of strategic alternatives for TDC A/S_

On 23 November 2009, TDC announced that it has been informed by its majority shareholder, NTC, that a
process with the purpose of evaluating strategic alternatives for TDC has been initiated.

TDC will to the extent necessary and appropriate assist in this strategic review.

TDC does not expect to publicly disclose additional information regarding the status of the review of
strategic alternatives until the review has been completed. There can be no assurances that any particular
course of action will be pursued nor of what the timing or the terms of such alternatives will be.

_Business combination of Sunrise and Orange in Switzerland_

On 25 November 2009, TDC announced that it has entered into a conditional agreement to combine its Swiss
subsidiary Sunrise with Orange in Switzerland, a subsidiary of France Telecom. As a result of a series of
transactions, TDC will receive a payment of EUR 1.5 billion at closing from France Telecom and become a
25 per cent. shareholder of the combined entity.

TDC will continue to consolidate Sunrise in its financial statements until further notice. Upon
deconsolidation, Sunrise's activities will be reclassified to discontinued operations. After closing, the 25 per
cent. shareholding in the combined entity will be accounted for as an associate (equity method).

The signing of final transaction documentation is expected to take place in the second half of February 2010.
The transaction shall, amongst other conditions, be subject to confirmatory due diligence and approvals from
TDC's lenders and the Swiss competition authorities. TDC currently expects closing of the agreement to take
place in the second quarter of 2010.

_Proposed TDC merger with NTC_

On 26 November 2009 the Board of Directors of TDC signed a merger plan with NTC. TDC intends that the
merger will be implemented as soon as possible, with TDC as the surviving company. The merger is
intended to be effective from 1 January 2009 for accounting purposes. The purpose of the merger is to
simplify the group structure and to optimise TDC's capital structure. The merger is expected to be adopted by
the Board of Directors of TDC before the end of 2009.

NTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nordic Telephone Company Holding ApS. In connection with the
merger, it is proposed that Nordic Telephone Company Holding ApS will acquire the shares held by NTC in
TDC prior to the merger, amounting to DKK 871,849,550 nominal value (174,369,910 shares of DKK 5).
NTC has no material assets or liabilities other than its holding of TDC shares, and therefore the merger will
not affect the NTC group’s ownership interest in TDC.


-----

_Acquisition of 100 per cent. of Unotel_

In 2007, TDC acquired 20 per cent. of Unotel A/S. On 11 December 2009 TDC entered into an agreement to
acquire the remaining 80 per cent. of Unotel A/S, which brings TDC's ownership to 100 per cent. The
agreement is expected to be closed in early January 2010.

**_Customers_**

At 30 September 2009, the TDC Group had 8.5 million customers in Denmark. In addition, the TDC Group

The TDC Group’s total customer base amounted to 11.4 million customers[∗] at 30 September 2009, up 7.4 per
cent from 30 September 2008, which was attributable mainly to the acquisition of Tele2 in Switzerland by
Sunrise in November 2008. The domestic customer base totalled 8.5 million, up 3.4 per cent. from 30
September 2008. This development resulted primarily from more mobile voice and data customers and more
TV customers, partly counteracted by fewer landline voice customers.

100 per cent. of Denmark’s population as at year end 2008. The mobile access network includes GSM and
UMTS. In Switzerland, the TDC Group has its own landline and GSM/EDGE and UMTS/HSDPA networks.
The TDC Group also operates its own landline network in the Nordic region.

**_Research and development_**

TDC’s research and development activities currently focus on developing broadband applications and
services, as well as IP-based and UMTS network platforms and wireless LAN capabilities. High-speed data
solutions, for example, HSDPA, have been implemented in the network since early 2008. TDC also
participates in international programs, including standardization efforts, and cooperates with independent
research organizations.

**_Intellectual property_**

TDC owns or has the right to use the various brands, including property rights, used within its operation.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Headquarters manages the majority of the TDC Group’s office premises and floor space in Denmark.
However, some of the TDC Group’s Danish operations, such as Telmore, manage their own premises.

The TDC Group’s principal properties consist of numerous telecommunications installations, including
exchanges of various sizes, transmission equipment, cable networks, base stations for mobile networks and
equipment for radio communications, most of which are located in Denmark. The TDC Group also has
numerous computer installations, which are located principally in Copenhagen and Aarhus.

**TAXATION**

**Danish Taxation**

_The following is a summary description of the taxation in Denmark of the Notes according to the Danish tax_
_laws in force at the date hereof and is subject to any changes in law and the interpretation and application_
_thereof, which changes could be made with retroactive effect. The following summary does not purport to be_
_a comprehensive description of all the tax considerations that may be relevant to a decision to acquire, hold_
_or dispose of the Notes, and does not purport to deal with the tax consequences applicable to all categories_
_of investors, some of which (such as professional dealers in securities) may be subject to special rules._
_Potential investors are under all circumstances strongly recommended to contact their own tax advisor to_
_clarify the individual consequences of their investment in, holding of and disposal of the Notes. The Issuer_
_makes no representations regarding the tax consequences of purchase, holding or disposal of the Notes._

_Taxation at source_

Under existing Danish tax laws no general withholding tax or coupon tax will apply to payments of interest
or principal or other amounts due on the Notes, other than in certain cases on payments in respect of
controlled debt in relation to the Issuer as referred to in consolidated Act no. 272 of 3 April 2009 as
amended. This will not have any impact on holders of Notes who are not "affiliated" with the Issuer (i.e. they
control or are controlled by the Issuer).

_Resident holders of Notes_

Under existing Danish tax laws, private individuals, including persons who are engaged in financial trade,
and companies, funds and similar entities, who are domiciled in Denmark for tax purposes, are (save for
certain exceptions) liable to pay tax on capital gains from the redemption or sale of the Notes and on
payments of interest under the Notes.

_Non-resident holders of Notes_

Under the Danish tax laws, payments of interest or principal amounts to any non-resident holders of Notes
are not subject to taxation in Denmark, no withholding tax will be payable with respect to such payments and
any capital gain realised upon the sale, exchange or retirement of a Note will not be subject to taxation in
Denmark, other than in certain cases on payments in respect of controlled debt in relation to the Issuer as
referred to under "Taxation at source" above.

This tax treatment applies solely to holders of Notes who are not subject to full tax liability in Denmark or
included in a Danish joint taxation scheme and do not carry on business in Denmark through a permanent
establishment.

**Luxembourg Taxation**

_The following summary is of a general nature and is included herein solely for information purposes. It is_
_based on the laws presently in force in Luxembourg, though it is not intended to be, nor should it be_
_construed to be, legal or tax advice. Prospective investors in the Notes should therefore consult their own_
_professional advisers as to the effects of state, local or foreign laws, including Luxembourg tax law, to which_
_they may be subject._

_Withholding Tax_

_(i)_ _Non-resident holders of Notes_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the laws of 21 June 2005 (the
**Laws) mentioned below, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or interest**
made to non-resident holders of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect of the Notes, nor


-----

is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of the Notes held by
non-resident holders of Notes.

Under the Laws implementing the EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC of 3 June 2003 on taxation of
savings income in the form of interest payments and ratifying the treaties entered into by
Luxembourg and certain dependent and associated territories of EU Member States (the
**Territories), payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent established**
in Luxembourg to or for the immediate benefit of an individual beneficial owner or a residual entity,
as defined by the Laws, which is a resident of, or established in, an EU Member State (other than
Luxembourg) or one of the Territories will be subject to a withholding tax unless the relevant
recipient has adequately instructed the relevant paying agent to provide details of the relevant
payments of interest or similar income to the fiscal authorities of his/her/its country of residence or
establishment, or, in the case of an individual beneficial owner, has provided a tax certificate issued
by the fiscal authorities of his/her country of residence in the required format to the relevant paying
agent. Where withholding tax is applied, it is currently levied at a rate of 20 per cent. and will be
levied at a rate of 35 per cent. as of 1 July 2011. Responsibility for the withholding of the tax will be
assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. Payments of interest under the Notes coming within the
scope of the Laws would at present be subject to withholding tax of 20 per cent.

_(ii)_ _Resident holders of Notes_

Under Luxembourg general tax laws currently in force and subject to the law of 23 December 2005
(the **Law) mentioned below, there is no withholding tax on payments of principal, premium or**
interest made to Luxembourg resident holders of Notes, nor on accrued but unpaid interest in respect
of Notes, nor is any Luxembourg withholding tax payable upon redemption or repurchase of Notes
held by Luxembourg resident holders of Notes.

Under the Law payments of interest or similar income made or ascribed by a paying agent
established in Luxembourg to or for the immediate benefit of an individual beneficial owner who is a
resident of Luxembourg will be subject to a withholding tax of 10 per cent. Such withholding tax
will be in full discharge of income tax if the beneficial owner is an individual acting in the course of
the management of his/her private wealth. Responsibility for the withholding of the tax will be
assumed by the Luxembourg paying agent. Payments of interest under the Notes coming within the
scope of the Law would be subject to withholding tax of 10 per cent.

**EU Savings Directive**

Under EC Council Directive 2003/48/EC on the taxation of savings income, Member States, including
Belgium from 1 January 2010, are required to provide to the tax authorities of another Member State details
of payments of interest (or similar income) paid by a person within its jurisdiction to an individual resident in
that other Member State or to certain limited types of entities established in that other Member State.
However, for a transitional period, Belgium, Luxembourg and Austria are instead required (unless during
that period they elect otherwise) to operate a withholding system in relation to such payments (the ending of
such transitional period being dependent upon the conclusion of certain other agreements relating to
information exchange with certain other countries). A number of non-EU countries and territories including
Switzerland have adopted similar measures (a withholding system in the case of Switzerland).

On 15 September 2008 the European Commission issued a report to the Council of the European Union on
the operation of the Directive, which included the Commission's advice on the need for changes to the
Directive. On 13 November 2008 the European Commission published a more detailed proposal for
amendments to the Directive, which included a number of suggested changes. If any of those proposed
changes are made in relation to the Directive, they may amend or broaden the scope of the requirements
described above.
