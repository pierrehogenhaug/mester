not measurements under IFRS or other generally accepted accounting principles, nor should they be considered
as substitutes for the information contained in our consolidated financial statements.

Euro translations are based on the set DKK/euro exchange rate of 7.46038 krone per euro except where
otherwise specified, and are provided for convenience only.

Danish kroner per euro is regulated by the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM II), a system originally established
in 1979 for controlling exchange rates within the European Monetary System of the EU. Under this system,
Denmark sets its central exchange rate to 7.46038 krone per euro and allows fluctuations of the exchange rate
within a 2.25% band. This means that Danish krone can fluctuate from a high of DKK 7.63 per €1.00 to a low of

**Our Company**

We are the leading provider of communications solutions in Denmark, the second-largest
telecommunications provider in Switzerland, and we have a significant presence in selected Northern and Central
European telecommunications markets. Over the past decade, we have transformed our business from a
traditional provider of landline and mobile telephony services in the Danish market into a Danish-based
European provider of communications solutions. At the end of 2005, we had more than 15 million customers in
Europe, including more than 9 million mobile customers. In 2005, we had revenue of DKK 46,588 million
(€6,245 million) and EBITDA before special items of DKK 13,003 million (€1,743 million).

Our five main business lines and their contribution to our revenue and EBITDA before special items for
the year ended December 31, 2005 are:

Š **TDC Solutions (46% of revenue, 51% of EBITDA before special items) provides communications**
services primarily in Denmark and the other Nordic countries. Its activities include landline telephony
services, convergence products (combined landline and mobile telephony), broadband solutions, data
communications services and internet services, leased lines, sale of terminals and installation and
advanced security and hosting services. In addition to offering telephony and data communications
services through its Danish network, TDC Solutions operates a pan-Nordic network mainly for
business customers through its wholly-owned subsidiary TDC Song, provides telecommunications
infrastructure products to Swedish business customers through its wholly-owned subsidiary TDC
Dotcom and provides IP/LAN infrastructure for business customers through its wholly-owned
subsidiary NetDesign. TDC Solutions also provides landline and data communications services in
Hungary through its 63.4% owned subsidiary HTCC.

Š **TDC Mobile International (34% of revenue, 22% of EBITDA before special items) provides mobile**
telecommunications services in Denmark and a number of other European countries. In addition to
being the leading provider of mobile telecommunications services in Denmark, TDC Mobile
International provides mobile telephony services in Germany through its wholly-owned subsidiary
Talkline, and in Lithuania and Latvia through its wholly-owned subsidiary Bité. TDC Mobile
International also holds a 19.6% stake in the Polish mobile operator Polkomtel (which is in the
process of being sold) and a 15.0% stake in the Austrian mobile operator One.

Š **TDC Switzerland (21% of revenue, 20% of EBITDA before special items) is the second-largest**
telecommunications provider in Switzerland, operating under the “sunrise” brand. Its activities include
mobile and landline telephony and internet services. TDC Switzerland has its own national fixed line
backbone, GSM and ISP networks, and is further developing and expanding its mobile network based
on EDGE and UMTS technology. The Swiss Parliament recently adopted ULL legislation that, if
enacted, will require the incumbent operator to grant access to its local loop to alternative providers,
which we believe will benefit our fixed line business.

Š **TDC Cable TV (5% of revenue, 4% of EBITDA before special items) is a Danish provider of cable**
TV, internet services and VoIP. TDC Cable TV supplies cable TV to more than 1.0 million
households by way of a 862 MHz fully digitized hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. TDC Cable TV
offers its customers triple play service (voice, broadband and television in one package).

Š **Other activities include TDC Services, which mainly provides business services for the TDC Group’s**
domestic business lines. The Other activities segment also includes intercompany eliminations.

Please note that the revenue and EBITDA before special items figures do not add up to 100%, due to
intragroup eliminations.


-----

We believe that the following are our key business strengths:

Š **_Leading positions in Denmark and Switzerland._** We are the incumbent and leading
telecommunications provider in Denmark and the second-largest telecommunications provider in
Switzerland. In our Danish fixed line business, we have a market share of 81% in landline telephony
and a retail market share of 72% in DSL, as measured by subscribers. In mobile, we are the number
one service provider in Denmark with a 41% market share. In cable TV, we are the number one
operator in Denmark with a 66% market share, providing TV services to approximately 40% of all
Danish households, and we have a 52% market share in the Danish pay TV market. In Denmark,
where we have a leading position as the former incumbent operator, we believe that the market is
highly liberalized and further regulatory changes will likely be less extensive than in other
jurisdictions. In Switzerland, we believe that we are well positioned as the leading alternative provider
to capitalize on market liberalization, including the recent legislative changes on ULL. We also have a
leading position in Lithuania and a significant presence in Germany, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia
and Hungary, as well as minority stakes in businesses in Poland (which we are in the process of
selling) and Austria.

Š **_Highly diverse telecommunications business._** We are a diverse company in terms of product
offerings, customer base and geography. In our key geographic markets, we are present in almost
every major area of the telecommunications sector; for example, we offer landline telephony,
broadband, mobile telephony and cable TV in Denmark. Our diversity in product offerings reduces
our exposure to technological substitution and technology and platform migration. For example,
although the Danish fixed line market has been affected by fixed-to-mobile substitution, our mobile
MOU have increased as a result of this substitution trend. Similarly, our strong market presence in
broadband and cable TV allows us to mitigate the decline in fixed voice usage by offering our
broadband customers VoIP as an alternative to PSTN services. Our wide range of product offerings
also affords us opportunities for synergies across platforms, allowing us to bundle and cross-sell
products and services and to tailor business solutions to our customers’ particular needs. We benefit
from a diverse customer base that consists of retail and wholesale customers and residential and
business customers from a wide range of industries. We also benefit from geographic diversity
through our operations in Switzerland, the Baltic region and other Northern and Central European
markets, which reduces our exposure to economic downturns in any one country.

Š **_Extensive network infrastructure._** We have the most extensive telecommunications network
infrastructure in Denmark, where our network has been fully upgraded to digital. We operate our own
networks in Switzerland, the Nordic countries, Lithuania, Latvia and Hungary. Our access network
reaches almost 100% of Denmark’s population and our DSL network can deliver speeds of at least
512 Kbps to 98% of Danish households and businesses and at least 4 Mbps to 90% of Danish
households and businesses. We expect to be able to deliver 8 Mbps DSL service to 85% of the Danish
population by the end of 2006. We view our access to such a high number of end users and locations
as a key advantage in marketing and selling our products. Our integrated network structure provides
us with the ability to cross-sell mobile, fixed line, cable TV and internet services and to capitalize on
strong brand awareness in Denmark and strong product offerings across our business lines, which may
result in reduced subscriber acquisition costs, increased ARPU and reduced churn.

Our extensive network allows us to provide wholesale services to our fixed line retail competitors, as
they often use our network. Our position as a network access provider in the Danish wholesale market
provides a stable source of revenue as in most cases we have retained the wholesale component of any
business that we have lost to competitors at the retail level. We also own and operate a backbone
network in the Nordic region, which is one of Europe’s fastest broadband networks for data, internet
and voice traffic. We believe our past investments in network infrastructure will lower our present
operating costs and will lower our capital expenditures in the future.

Š **_Strong financial performance and high cash flow generation._** Despite a relatively high level of
competition in Denmark in both the fixed and mobile business areas in recent years, we delivered
organic growth in EBITDA before special items of 4.0% in 2005. We have also steadily reduced our
costs, in particular labor costs in Denmark, and have disposed of assets, where reasonable and
profitable. As a result of our increased revenue, successful operating cost management and disciplined
capital expenditure, we have significantly increased our operating cash flow and cash flow


-----

million) for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. We intend to continue to create value
through active portfolio management.

Š **_Experienced management team and strong equity sponsorship._** Our management team of industry
professionals has significant experience in the mobile, fixed line, cable TV and internet services markets
in Denmark and abroad and has a proven track record in growing our businesses, including our Chief
Executive Officer, Henning Dyremose, who has held his current position since 1998 and was previously
the Minister of Finance in Denmark, and our Chief Financial Officer, Hans Munk Nielsen, who has held
his current position since 1991. As one of the longest serving and highly regarded telecommunications
management teams in Europe, our management team has demonstrated its ability to grow the business
and increase EBITDA before special items in both favorable and adverse market conditions.

Our principal shareholders are a group of investment funds (the “Consortium”) each of which is
respectively advised or managed, directly or indirectly, by Apax Partners Worldwide LLP
(collectively, “Apax”), Blackstone Management Partners IV L.L.C. and Blackstone Communications
Advisors I L.L.C. (collectively with their affiliates referred to as “Blackstone”), Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts & Co. L.P. (collectively, “KKR”), Permira Advisers KB (collectively, “Permira”) or
Providence Equity Partners Limited (collectively, “Providence”), all leading European and U.S.
private equity funds that have a strong track record in the telecommunications and cable TV sector.

**Our Business Strategy**

The key components of our strategy are as follows:

Š **_Maintain position as market leader in Denmark and seek to benefit from regulatory changes in_**
**_Switzerland._** We intend to build on our position as the incumbent provider of integrated telephony,
broadband and cable TV services in Denmark and to benefit from regulatory changes that may
enhance our position in Switzerland as the leading alternative to the incumbent operator. We seek to
achieve this by cross-selling mobile, fixed line, cable TV and internet services, and capitalizing on
strong brand awareness in Denmark and Switzerland. In Denmark, we will continue to strengthen our
market position through a full set of product and service offerings, including triple play service and
convergence products. We also intend to capitalize on our expansive network, access to content
expertise and content delivery technology from our cable TV business. We will seek to strengthen our
leadership by earning our customers’ long-term loyalty through retention programs and by offering
the best customer experience and value for money. We seek to drive technology transitions where
profitable and to invest in marketing to maintain and refresh brand awareness. We are encouraged by
the recent Swiss ULL legislation, and believe that, if ULL is deployed expeditiously and on
satisfactory terms, we will be in a good position to expand our customer base, geographical reach and
product and service portfolio in Switzerland.

Š **_Continue to increase efficiencies._** We seek to continue to increase operational and capital
expenditure efficiencies to improve operating margins and increase cash flows. We intend to continue
to reduce headcount in Denmark, particularly in our fixed line business. We will focus on a strict cost
management policy and intend to maintain a disciplined capital expenditure program. We currently
expect to reduce domestic headcount in the order of 5% per annum until the end of 2007.

Š **_Focus on selected growth opportunities in broadband and mobile services._** We seek to take
advantage of the growth in broadband and VoIP penetration in Denmark, in order to partially offset
the anticipated overall decline in traditional voice. The broadband market in Denmark is rapidly
growing and we expect penetration to increase from 54% in 2005 to 80% by 2010. To expand our
product offerings and to counter emerging technologies, we plan to offer broadband at high speeds
over cable and DSL with full triple play service, an area in which we have expertise. We also intend to
strengthen our mobile business by offering innovative products such as data services (mobile
broadband) via the UMTS network (3G), and increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty, which we
believe will lead to a moderate increase in our subscriber base, a decline in churn and an increasing
usage of services. As we have done with our UMTS roll out to date, we intend to continue our policy
of entering the market for new products only at a stage where we consider they are sufficiently mature
for profitable investment.


-----

intend to review our activities across the board to determine the most attractive businesses for organic
expansion and further investments, where reasonable and justified by expected returns, or,
alternatively, for divestiture. For instance, we believe that our comprehensive fixed line Nordic
network acquired through the Song Networks acquisition (now TDC Song) gives us a low-cost
opportunity to serve our customers on a pan-Nordic basis, improve our market position, presence and
cost structure and challenge competitors by leveraging opportunities offered by technology transitions
and customer orientation. TDC Song’s IP-VPN business in the Nordic region provides a strong
platform from which to further our growth. We will continue to review our existing holdings of
minority interests and non-core businesses to determine whether to continue to maintain these going
forward or, where suitable, to make disposals.

Š **_Focus on de-leveraging._** We intend to implement the above strategies with a focus on cash flow
generation in order to reduce our debt levels going forward. We seek to achieve this through further
organic growth in our business, further reduction of cost of employees, discipline in our capital
expenditures, increasing our efficiencies and active management of our portfolio of assets. We will
continue to evaluate the future potential of each of our assets with a view to either dispose of them at a
profit, or to build on their current positions. We believe that these measures and the above strategies
will enable us to maximize our cash flow and margin and delever our capital structure.

**The Acquisition and Related Financings**

_The Tender Offer._ On February 1, 2006, the Purchaser acquired approximately 88.2% of the outstanding
share capital of TDC. The share capital was acquired pursuant to a tender offer, combined with open market
purchases made at the same time (collectively, the “Tender Offer”) by the Purchaser for all ordinary shares
issued by TDC (“TDC Shares”) and all American Depositary Shares (“TDC ADSs”), each representing one half
of one TDC Share, at a price of DKK 382 (€51.0) per TDC Share and DKK 191 (€25.50) per TDC ADS.

_The Debt Tender and Redemption._ In conjunction with the Tender Offer, the Issuer invited the holders
of certain series of TDC’s Euro Medium Term Notes (the “EMTNs”), excluding a series of notes due on
April 24, 2006, to offer to sell such EMTNs to the Issuer or another entity designated by the Issuer (the
“Invitations”). In March 2006, TDC assumed the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the Invitations and acquired or
redeemed €1,770 million of the EMTNs pursuant to the Invitations, leaving €1,284 million of the EMTNs
(excluding the notes due in April 2006) outstanding (the “Debt Tender”). On April 24, 2006, TDC will redeem
the €685 million of notes due on that date (the “Redemption”) with cash and amounts drawn under the Senior
Credit Facilities (as defined below). See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

_Financings._ In connection with the Tender Offer, the Purchaser received a cash equity contribution of
DKK 16.4 billion (€2,197 million) and the Issuer entered into senior credit facilities (the “Senior Credit
Facilities”) and a bridge facility (the “Bridge Facility”). TDC has acceded to the Senior Credit Facilities as a
borrower and a guarantor. The Senior Credit Facilities include a term loan facility drawn in an amount of €1,576
million (the “Term A Facility”), a term loan facility drawn in an amount of €2,465 million (the “Term B
Facility”) and a term loan facility drawn in an amount of €2,465 million (the “Term C Facility” and, together
with the Term A Facility and the Term B Facility, the “Term Facilities”), each used, among other things, to
finance the Tender Offer, the Debt Tender and Redemption, refinance indebtedness, pay fees and fund the Debt
Pushdown (as described below). The Senior Credit Facilities also include a revolving credit facility of up to €700
million (the “Revolving Credit Facility”), the proceeds of which may be used to, among other things, finance our
working capital requirements and capital expenditures and finance the payment of interest on the indebtedness of
the Issuer.

The Bridge Facility consists of a term loan facility drawn in an amount of €2,031 million. The proceeds
from the issuance of the notes will be used to repay the amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility. Following
this repayment, approximately €269 million will be available under the Bridge Facility until May 30, 2006. The
Senior Credit Facilities permit us under certain circumstances to apply asset sale proceeds to repay any amounts
under the Bridge Facility. The Bridge Facility contains certain negative undertakings and covenants that are
substantially similar to those under the Senior Credit Facilities. After the offering is completed, the Bridge
Facility covenants will be conformed to be substantially similar to those included in the notes. See “The
Acquisition and Related Financings,” “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Description of Other
Indebtedness.”

As used in this offering memorandum, the term “Financings” refers to the financing transactions
described in the preceding two paragraphs.


-----

February 28, 2006, the Purchaser elected new board members and proposed that TDC seek to delist its shares and
ADSs from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and from the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”), respectively,
and subsequently seek to deregister all securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”). The Purchaser also proposed the introduction of a new clause into the
articles of association of TDC permitting the compulsory acquisition of the shares of minority shareholders.
These proposals attained an affirmative vote of over 90% of the share capital of TDC represented at the EGM
and such resolutions were declared passed by the EGM. Subsequently, the Danish Commerce and Companies
Agency (“DCCA”) ruled that it would not register the new articles of association. Further, the Danish Labour
Market Supplementary Pension Scheme (“ATP”), a Danish pension fund holding 5.5% of the shares in TDC, has
filed a writ with the Copenhagen City Court (which has been passed on to the Eastern High Court) against both
TDC and the Purchaser seeking an acknowledgment of the invalidity of both the squeeze-out provisions in the
articles of association and the authorization to delist from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and the NYSE
granted at the EGM. On April 5, TDC and the Purchaser announced that they would challenge the DCCA’s
ruling in the Danish courts. TDC has proceeded with its intention to delist its ADSs from the NYSE, which
delisting occurred on April 19, 2006. If ATP succeeds with its litigation, we will be unable to proceed with the
compulsory acquisition.

_Debt Pushdown._ On April 11, 2006, the amounts originally drawn by the Issuer under the Senior Credit
Facilities were repaid with amounts received by the Purchaser from TDC by way of extraordinary dividend (and
in turn paid to the Issuer by way of dividend). To finance part of this dividend (together with a pro rata dividend
paid to remaining minority shareholders in TDC), TDC drew down €4,765 million under the Senior Credit
Facilities.

As used in this offering memorandum, the term “Acquisition” means, collectively, the Tender Offer and
the Debt Tender and Redemption; the term “Transactions” means, collectively, the Acquisition, the Financings
and the Debt Pushdown described above.

_Use of Proceeds._ The proceeds from the issuance of the notes will be used to repay amounts outstanding
under the Bridge Facility. The following table summarizes the sources and uses of funds in connection with the
Transactions, including the Tender Offer, the Debt Tender and Redemption, the Financings and the Debt
Pushdown and the payment of fees and expenses in relation thereto:

(*) The amounts of certain of the uses of funds presented in this offering memorandum differ from the
amounts previously disclosed to certain participants in the Senior Credit Facilities and the Bridge Facility.
Such differences, which include the amounts of existing debt refinanced, estimated fees and expenses,
minority interest dividend payments and accrued interest, are due to differences in the nature of the
sources and uses presentation, the decision to pay a higher extraordinary dividend than had been assumed
and the inclusion of accrued interest on the EMTNs due 2006 and temporary financing and hedging
arrangements.

**Recent Developments**

TDC has not published any financial information in respect of the first quarter of 2006, which ended on
March 31, 2006, and its compilation and verification of financial data in respect of such quarter is not complete.
However, based on currently available information, TDC estimates its revenue for the first quarter of 2006 to be
higher than for the first quarter of 2005 before adjustment for acquisition and divestments of enterprises and, to a

items for the first quarter of 2006 to be higher than for the first quarter of 2005 before adjustment for acquisitions
and divestments of enterprises and, to a lesser extent, after adjustment for acquisitions and divestments. TDC
estimates that, as expected, revenue and EBITDA before special items declined for the TDC Switzerland segment
in the first quarter of 2006 compared to the first quarter of 2005, despite the growth on a group basis. These
estimates are based on financial information that is not final and is subject to change, and therefore no investment
decision should be based on these estimates. TDC has announced that it will issue its earnings release for the first
quarter of 2006 on May 4, 2006.

Our sale of our 19.6% share ownership in the Polish mobile operator Polkomtel is still pending. The sale
is currently subject to an injunction as part of unresolved litigation initiated by Vodafone, another Polkomtel
shareholder, to prevent the sale. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.”

In the legal proceedings instigated by ATP against the Purchaser and TDC described above, ATP has
reserved the right to challenge authorizations proposed for adoption at the annual general meeting of TDC on
April 26, 2006 as illegal, in particular authorizations (i) to issue warrants to management and others and (ii) to
repurchase shares. Furthermore, ATP claims that the reference date with regard to the redemption price of ATP’s
shares should only be decided as of when the redemption may actually be completed. Finally, ATP claims that
the Purchaser should pay interest on the redemption price. TDC and the Purchaser have not yet responded to
these claims by ATP. See “Business—Legal Proceedings.”

The following diagram summarizes our corporate and financing structure after giving effect to the
Transactions. See “Use of Proceeds,” “Capitalization,” “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of
the Notes” for more detailed descriptions.

(1) The equity interests in Nordic Telephone Company Holding ApS are owned by the Consortium and by
certain co-investors. The Consortium consists of investment funds and entities, each of which is advised
or managed, directly or indirectly by Apax, Blackstone, KKR, Permira or Providence. The Investors and
certain other equity co-investors to whom equity has been syndicated (together, the “Equity Investors”)
have entered into a subscription and shareholders agreement. For details on the subscription and
shareholders agreement and certain other co-investors, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party
Transactions — The Shareholders Agreement.”
(2) TDC has borrowed €6,506 million under the Senior Credit Facilities, including the €4,765 million
borrowed in connection with the Debt Pushdown. The Senior Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the
Issuer and secured by a first-ranking pledge over the shares of the Purchaser and will also be secured by
first-ranking security over certain assets of TDC and its subsidiaries. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness — Senior Credit Facilities.” The Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of €700 million
included in the Senior Credit Facilities may be drawn by the Issuer for, among other things, the service of
interest under the notes and Bridge Facility, until January 30, 2008. It may also be drawn by TDC until
December 31, 2012.
(3) Amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility will be discharged with the proceeds of the notes. An
additional €269 million will be available under the Bridge Facility until May 30, 2006. The Bridge
Facility is secured by a second-ranking pledge of the shares of the Purchaser, ranking equally with the
pledge securing the notes.
(4) The notes will have the benefit of security in the form of a second-priority pledge of 100% of the shares
of the Purchaser, ranking equally with the pledge securing the Bridge Facility.
(5) Approximately 0.3% of the tendered shares were owned by TDC employees and must be returned if the
compulsory acquisition does not occur. If the Purchaser returns these shares, it will own 87.9% of the
share capital of TDC.

certain withholding taxes on amounts payable on the notes. If we decide
to do this, we must pay you a price equal to the principal amount of the
notes plus interest and certain other amounts. See “Description of the
Notes — Redemption for Taxation Reasons.”

**Change of Control . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** If we experience a change of control, we will be required to offer to
repurchase the notes at 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and
unpaid interest. See “Description of the Notes — Change of Control.”

Investors.”

**No Prior Market . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .** The notes will be new securities for which there is currently no market.
Although the Joint Book-Running Lead Managers have informed us that
they intend to make a market for the notes, they are not obligated to do
so and they may discontinue market-making at any time without notice.
Accordingly, a liquid market for the notes may not be developed or

**Risk Factors**

Investing in the notes involves substantial risk. You should carefully consider all the information in this
offering memorandum prior to investing in the notes. In particular, you should consider carefully the factors set
forth under the heading “Risk Factors” below.


-----

The Issuer is a holding company which, apart from financing the Acquisition, does not have independent
external operations other than through the indirect ownership of 88.2% of TDC’s share capital; control of TDC
was obtained in early 2006. Accordingly, the historical financial information presented herein is that of TDC and
no separate financial statements of the Issuer on a stand-alone basis are included in this offering memorandum.

The following summary historical IFRS financial data for TDC as of and for the years ended
December 31, 2004 and 2005 have been derived from our audited financial statements and notes thereto which
have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and are included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. TDC has
not prepared audited financial statements in accordance with IFRS for periods prior to 2004. We have also
included summary historical Danish GAAP financial data for TDC as of and for the years ended December 31,
2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. The unaudited Danish GAAP financial data as of and for the year ended
December 31, 2001 has been derived from TDC’s Annual Report on Form 20-F filed for 2004. The financial data
as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 have been derived from TDC’s previous
audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Danish GAAP as filed with the SEC in TDC’s Annual
Report on Form 20-F for 2004. We have also included in this section unaudited operational data for the five years
ended December 31, 2005 which has been derived from TDC’s operating systems and from industry sources and
not from TDC’s audited financial statements.

TDC’s historical consolidated financial statements are presented in Danish kroner and have been prepared
in accordance with either IFRS or Danish GAAP, which differ in certain significant respects from US GAAP.
The material differences between Danish GAAP and IFRS as they relate to TDC are discussed in note 1 to our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum. The material differences
between US GAAP and IFRS as they relate to TDC are discussed in note 34 to our consolidated financial
statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

The following summary unaudited pro forma financial data of the Issuer have been prepared to give
pro forma effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on January 1, 2005, in the case of the unaudited
pro forma statement of income data, and on December 31, 2005, in the case of the unaudited pro forma balance
sheet data. The pro forma financial data of the Issuer are provided for informational purposes only and should not
be considered indicative of actual results that would have been achieved had the Transactions been consummated
on the dates indicated and do not purport to indicate balance sheet data or results of operations as of any future
date or for any future period. You should read the following data in conjunction with “The Acquisition and
Related Financings,” “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements,” “Operating and Financial Review
and Prospects” and the consolidated IFRS financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this
offering memorandum and the consolidated Danish GAAP financial statements and notes thereto included in
TDC’s Annual Report on Form 20-F for 2004.

While the Purchaser (which is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of the Issuer) had offered to acquire
100% of the outstanding TDC share capital, as of the date of this offering memorandum the Purchaser has
acquired approximately 88.2%, and the remaining 11.8% of TDC’s share capital is owned by public
shareholders. Approximately 0.3% of the tendered shares were owned by employees and must be returned if the
compulsory acquisition does not occur. If the Purchaser returns these shares, it will own 87.9% of the share
capital of TDC. The pro forma financial information has been prepared to reflect the acquisition of 88.2% of the
outstanding TDC share capital and therefore does not give effect to this possibility. It is possible that the
Purchaser could subsequently acquire additional shares of TDC’s share capital, including through the incurrence
of additional indebtedness or through the contribution of further equity. However, no commitments have
currently been made in this respect and it is therefore not possible to determine the price at which any such
purchases would be made nor the method of financing such purchases. For further detail, please see the footnotes
to the financial data presented in this section and “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements.”

(1) Special items include significant amounts that cannot be attributed to normal operations such as large gains and losses related to
divestment of subsidiaries, special write-downs for impairment and costs for restructuring and others. Items of a similar nature for the
non-consolidated enterprises are recognized under income from associates and net income from discontinued operations. In 2005,
special items covered only restructuring costs and amounted to DKK (968) million (€(130) million) before tax and DKK (817) million
(€(110) million) after tax, reflecting primarily the redundancy programs in the domestic operations and costs for financial and legal
advisers related to the Tender Offer. In 2004, special items amounted to DKK 385 million (€52 million) before tax and DKK
741 million (€99 million) after tax. Profit before tax on divestment of major enterprises amounted to DKK 943 million (€126 million)
before tax, reflecting primarily the disposal of Dan Net. Restructuring costs before tax amounted to DKK (558) million (€(75) million)
and related primarily to the redundancy programs in the domestic operations. Restructuring costs after tax amounted to DKK
(192) million (€(26) million), of which DKK 199 million (€27 million) related to a change in the tax value of goodwill in Talkline.
(2) Net financial items consists of financial income, financial expense and fair value adjustments.
(3) Gross debt represents the amount of principal repayable irrespective of related transaction costs, if any (i.e., before adjustment for any
unamortized issue costs, debt discounts or premiums arising on issuance). For purposes of the balance sheet presentation under IFRS,
debt is shown net of any unamortized issue costs, debt discounts or premiums arising on issuance.
(4) EBITDA before special items is operating income before depreciation, amortization and special items, as shown on our statement of
income. This measure is presented as we believe that it and similar measures are widely used in the global telecommunications
industry as a means of evaluating a company’s operating performance.
(5) EBITDA margin is EBITDA before special items divided by revenue.
(6) Capital expenditures include expenditures on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, but excludes share acquisitions.
(7) The capex-to-revenue ratio is calculated by dividing capital expenditures, excluding share acquisitions, by revenue. The
capex-to-revenue ratio is presented as a measure of the extent to which revenue is being spent on capital expenditures.
We have also provided an adjusted capex-to-revenue ratio, which excludes Talkline etc. (which includes our Talkline and easyMobile
activities). Talkline etc.’s revenue was DKK 7,763 million (€1,041 million) in 2005 (2004: DKK 7,675 million (€1,029 million)) and
capital expenditure was DKK 73 million (€10 million ) in 2005 (2004: DKK 112 million (€15 million)). Talkline is a reseller of
telephony products and as a result has disproportionately low capital expenditure requirements compared to our business as a whole.
You should note that certain other aspects of our non-reselling business may have low capital expenditure requirements.
(8) Change in working capital is change in inventory, receivables, trade payables and certain other items.
(9) You should note that the financial information includes results of HTCC, which is consolidated. HTCC will be designated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary under the Indenture. For 2005, HTCC, which prepares its financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP,
publicly reported revenues, adjusted EBITDA, cash and cash equivalents, and long-term debt of $110.2 million (€93.1 million), $50.6
million (€42.7 million), $15.1 million (€12.8 million) and $158.2 million (€133.6 million), respectively, using the December 31, 2005
exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.1842. These figures are not comparable with HTCC’s contribution to TDC’s results. We have not
received any cash dividends from HTCC since acquiring our stake in HTCC.
(10) Pro Forma EBITDA before special items is EBITDA before special items of the Issuer pro forma for the Transactions. For more detail
on the pro forma information included herein, please see “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements.”
Note that Pro Forma EBITDA before special items is calculated before minority interest, including minority interest related to the
11.8% of TDC owned by minority shareholders (before any return by the Purchaser of 0.3% of TDC’s share capital). However, in
order for the Issuer to have access to cash amounts from TDC by means of dividends from TDC, TDC will be required to pay
dividends to minority shareholders on a pro rata basis. The Issuer is not currently able to estimate the amount of such dividends.
However, assuming a requirement for interest service of the notes of DKK 1,452 million (€196 million) annually (in accordance with
footnote (b) to the unaudited pro forma statement of income included under “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements”),
pro rata dividends to minority shareholders in an amount of DKK 171 million (€23 million) annually would be required, if all such
payments were to be serviced using funds derived from dividends from TDC. In addition, operating expenses of the Issuer that were
serviced by dividends would also require the payment of a minority dividend. The Issuer may service interest and other expenses from
other sources, including through drawing under the Revolving Credit Facility which is available to be drawn by the Issuer until
January 30, 2008.
(11) Gross debt on a pro forma basis is derived from the unaudited pro forma balance sheet included under “Unaudited Pro Forma
Combined Financial Statements.” Senior secured debt on a pro forma basis reflects that portion of Gross debt represented by
borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities (and therefore does not include other secured financing such as capital leases and
mortgages). Gross debt represents the amount of principal repayable irrespective of related transaction costs, if any (i.e., before
adjustment for any unamortized issue costs, debt discounts, or premiums arising on issuance). For purposes of the balance sheet
presentation under IFRS, debt is shown net of any unamortized issue costs, debt discounts, or premiums arising on issuance.
(12) Cash interest expense on a pro forma basis is derived from the unaudited pro forma statement of income included under “Unaudited
Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements.” It is presented net of any expense related to amortization of debt issuance costs, discount
and premium.
(13) The Ratio of Pro Forma EBITDA before special items to cash interest expense is calculated by dividing our Pro Forma EBITDA
before special items by pro forma cash interest expense. The Adjusted ratio of Pro Forma EBITDA before special items to cash
interest expense is calculated by dividing our Pro Forma EBITDA before special items by adjusted pro forma cash interest expense.
These measures are presented as we believe they and similar measures are widely used by investors and credit agencies as an indicator
of our ability to cover scheduled interest payments with funds generated from operations.
The adjusted pro forma cash interest expense amount used in the adjusted ratio is our pro forma cash interest expense (derived from
the pro forma information included under “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements”), increased by the amount of pro
rata dividends that we would be required to pay to minority shareholders were we to service interest payments for the notes by means
solely of dividend payments from TDC. Please see footnote (10) for a calculation of the pro forma pro rata dividend payment to be
made to minority investors on this basis.
We have presented this adjusted ratio as the service of interest on the notes through the payment of dividends by TDC would require
pro rata minority dividend payments, and we believe that this ratio therefore gives more information as to the cash costs of servicing
interest payments of the Issuer.

before special items. The adjusted ratio of gross debt to Pro Forma EBITDA before special items is calculated by dividing our adjusted
Pro Forma Gross debt by our Pro Forma EBITDA before special items. The ratio of senior secured debt to Pro Forma EBITDA before
special items is calculated by dividing our pro forma senior secured debt by our Pro Forma EBITDA before special items. We have
presented these measures as we believe that they or similar measures are widely used by investors and credit agencies as an indicator
of financial risk, including our ability to repay or refinance our debt obligations.

The adjusted pro forma gross debt amount used in the adjusted ratio is our pro forma gross debt (derived from the pro forma
information included under “Unaudited Pro Forma Combined Financial Statements”), increased (in the case of debt incurred by the
Purchaser or any parent of the Purchaser) by 11.8% in order to reflect the amount of distributions that may be required from TDC to
fund not only the repayment of the principal amount of the notes but also pro rata dividend amounts to minority shareholders.

average number of customers for such period. The average number of customers for a period is calculated by adding the number of
customers at the beginning of such period to the number of customers at the end of such period and dividing by two. In general, we
calculate churn using external gross decrease. However, internal migration between TDC Mobile A/S and Telmore is included in
churn figures. Hence, internal migration will be recorded as higher churn. Different telecommunications companies calculate churn in
different manners.

_You should carefully consider the risks described below as well as the other information contained in this_
_offering memorandum before making an investment decision. Any of the following risks could materially_
_adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In such case, you may lose_
_all or part of your original investment._

_The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently_
_known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business,_
_financial condition, results of operations or cash flows._

**Risks Related to Our Business**

**_We operate in highly competitive industries, and competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on_**
**_our main business lines._**

We face significant competition from established and new competitors. In our international operations,
we compete against companies with in some cases better access to financing, more comprehensive product
offerings, greater personnel resources, greater brand name recognition and experience or long-established
relationships with regulatory authorities and customers. If we cannot match the product offerings, services or
prices of our competitors, we may lose market share. If we are forced to lower our prices to match the prices of
our competitors, we may experience decreasing profit margins and EBITDA before special items.

In summary, competition in our business could lead to:

Š continued price erosion for our products and services;

Š loss of existing or prospective customers and greater difficulty in retaining existing customers;

Š obsolescence of existing technologies and the need for more rapid deployment of new technologies;
and

Š increased pressure on our profit margins and EBITDA before special items, preventing us from
maintaining or improving our current level of operational profitability and cash flows.

_Landline and Broadband._ We expect increased competition to our landline business due to price
reductions by our competitors, the development of new technologies, including VoIP, and fixed-to-mobile
substitution. These factors may result in a loss of fixed line subscribers and market share, which could adversely
affect our revenue and profit margins.

Providers of VoIP are offering telephony at significantly reduced prices. Therefore, there is considerable
risk that our own introduction of VoIP could negatively affect our landline operation’s future earnings potential,
as we may not be able to maintain a price level for VoIP similar to levels for PSTN.

Continuing competition is also expected in landline telephony from IP-based internal networks (such as
IP-VPN for business customers), antenna and housing association networks and utility companies using their
infrastructure to provide telephony and broadband. Similarly, in the market for leased lines, continuing
competition is likely from substitution products, including new IP-based transmission products such as MPLS,
Ethernet solutions, landline networks, local digital networks, wireless networks, WLAN, WiMAX and CDMA/
450 MHz. Such products are often priced lower than leased lines, and product quality is sufficiently strong to
constitute a viable alternative to traditional landline solutions. Although we offer our customers substitution
products and services to our traditional telephony products and services, including VoIP and broadband access,
there is no assurance that our current telephony customers will switch to our substitution products and services
and not those of a competitor. Even if we manage to capture 100% of customer conversions from traditional
telephony to substitution products, our landline business may still experience decreasing profit margins as
margins for substitution products and services are generally lower than those for traditional telephony products
and services.

Further growth in the landline market requires us to lead or adapt to technological developments,
including the market’s demand for higher DSL speeds. We expect the future landline market to be dominated by
those providers who can offer high quality telephony, TV and internet in one package, known as triple play, at
attractive prices. This type of bundled product puts increasing demands on providers because of the
technological, logistical and pricing complexities of combining these three services into a single product offering.
If we fail to adapt to or lead technological developments, or to offer an attractive triple play package, our market
share and profit margins in the landline sector may be adversely affected.

In general, our future success in the landline market will depend on our ability to shift toward VoIP and
other IP-based products, and adapt to lower prices for our services and generally more competitive market
conditions. If we are unsuccessful in dealing with these risks, our revenue and profit margins may be negatively
affected


-----

Denmark, such a migration could negatively affect our earnings.

Competitive pressure in broadband may increase due to continuing competition from new product
offerings from other providers. A number of operators have launched VoIP over DSL and utility companies have
announced a long-term roll out of FTTH. In total, the utility companies expect to roll out FTTH to 40%, or
approximately one million, of Danish households.

_Mobile._ We may not be able to develop and market attractive mobile services at competitive prices,
which may prevent our mobile business from maintaining or increasing revenue and earnings.

As market price levels for many mobile services continue to fall, including price reductions as a result of
regulations in certain jurisdictions limiting prices for terminating calls in our mobile networks and for roaming
charges, further growth in earnings will require improved sales volumes or continued cost control, which we may
fail to achieve.

Although our size gives us economies of scale, our mobile operations continue to be challenged by new
business models and the introduction of new products by our competitors. We have implemented a new business
model for online self-service mobile telephony through our Danish subsidiary Telmore. There is no guarantee
that this new business model will stay profitable. In addition, we face the risk that our competitors may introduce
new and successful business models before we do or that we may not be able to adopt such new business models
to our business. Moreover, our success in such a competitive environment will depend on our ability to keep pace
with new mobile technologies, including the change from 2G to 3G mobile telephony, video telephony and data
packaging. Growth in mobile data services is expected to be driven by an increase in the quantitative and
qualitative capabilities of mobile business applications. Our success with 3G technology depends largely on our
ability to develop and introduce attractive 3G products and services at competitive prices, including our ability to
benefit from general developments in the content services market. The introduction of VoIP may also threaten
mobile telephony in the long term because of its low cost. Failure to lead or adapt to such technical changes in
the mobile market or to compete with or adopt new business models may have a materially adverse effect on our
mobile business.

_Cable TV._ TDC Cable TV is expected to face increasing competition from a number of sources,
including utility companies, large antenna co-operatives and housing associations and satellite television
providers. Competition is driven by price, convenience and the range of channels offered. I/S DIGI-TV, an entity
owned by the Danish state broadcasting services, launched DTT in March 2006, which utilizes digital technology
to provide a greater number of channels and picture and sound enhancements such as HDTV and Dolby Digital
through a conventional antenna. Although DTT currently offers three channels, it is expected that DTT will
expand to up to 16 channels by 2009. DTT is expected to result in a greater range of channels in the generally
accessible terrestrial network, which will increase competition. In the long term, increased competition in the
Danish cable TV market may also arise from new technology, most notably from future internet-based content
providers. Failure by TDC Cable TV to meet these challenges may have a materially adverse effect on our
market share in the Danish cable TV market.

**_Increasing competition in the Danish, Swiss and certain other European telecommunications markets in_**
**_which we have major operations makes us vulnerable to margin squeeze and further market share loss._**

The Danish telecommunications sector is highly competitive. The main drivers of competition in this
market are the strong reduction in interconnection prices, competitors in the Danish market such as TeliaSonera,
Tele2 and Sonofon, and the regulatory requirement that we provide our competitors with access to our network.
To remain successful in this market, we may be required to reduce the prices for our services. In the Danish
mobile market, prices have been declining due to fierce competition, particularly from online products.
Broadband customers are being offered increasing bandwidth at unchanged or even falling prices. Although
traditionally our prices for landline and mobile telephony as well as leased lines in Denmark have been among
the lowest in the EU, as market pressures continue, our Danish operations may experience further reductions in
profit margins. In the past few years, we have experienced loss of market share in the Danish landline and mobile
markets.

We believe that ongoing regulatory initiatives in Denmark will make the Danish telecommunications
market increasingly competitive, which has been the case with telecommunications regulations in recent years.
These regulatory initiatives, such as CPS and number portability, have increased the ease with which our
customers can move to other operators. As a result of these regulatory measures, competition in the Danish
telecommunications market has increased and we have lost market share in the Danish telecommunications


-----

“—Risks Related to Regulatory Matters and Litigation” below.

In the pan-Nordic market, our business customers increasingly demand Nordic solutions covering crossborder landline telephony, data communications, IP telephony and mobile communications, where competition,
especially from other pan-Nordic providers, is intensifying. We face increasing competition from the Nordic
operators Telenor and TeliaSonera, each of which offers a full product suite of mobile, broadband, voice and TV.
If we are unable to provide cross-border solutions to our Nordic business customers, we risk losing an important
segment of our customer base.

Our foreign subsidiaries also face increasing competition. This development could adversely affect the
revenue and profit margins of our foreign subsidiaries. Almost half of TDC’s 2005 revenue was related to
operations outside Denmark, including operations in a number of emerging markets.

With regard to our Swiss landline business, TDC Switzerland has experienced price decreases in the
landline market due to competition from established competitors, including the incumbent Swisscom. Such
competition may result in loss of customers, reduced revenue and a lower profit margin in Switzerland.
Competition in Switzerland is expected to intensify because established cable network operators, such as
Cablecom, are offering landline telephony through their existing networks at very low or flat rate prices.

With respect to the Swiss mobile market, TDC Switzerland faces the risk of increased pricing pressure
from competition from new MVNOs entering the market. In addition, future growth in revenue and earnings
within the mobile telephony sector will depend on our ability to establish a presence in the business market,
which we may not be able to achieve. In the past year, the Swiss mobile market has experienced intense
competition, driven by Swisscom’s attempt to retain its market share, which may result in declining margins and
diluted earnings. The still increasing mobile penetration in the Swiss mobile market may result in fierce
competition for remaining customers, which could in turn lead to a rise in customer-acquisition and retention
costs, and further pressure on earnings.

The future growth of Bité will depend primarily on winning market share in Latvia, which Bité, as a new
entrant there, may not be able to achieve. More generally, the future growth of Bité will also depend on countrywide factors beyond our control such as poor economic growth that may have an adverse effect on the
competitive environment in Latvia and Lithuania. The future success of Talkline will depend largely on its ability
to keep a large portion of the gross margin on traffic resales for itself when negotiating with network suppliers.
There is also a significant risk of future pressure on retail prices in the German mobile market, which are high
compared to price levels in other countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.

**_The mobile telecommunications market in Denmark is mature and approaching saturation, with the_**
**_consequence that subscriber growth in the market has slowed in recent years and our mobile business may not_**
**_grow at historical rates._**

The mobile telecommunications market in Denmark is approaching saturation, with a penetration rate of
101%. The degree to which the Danish mobile telecommunications market will continue to expand, if at all, is
uncertain. We believe that, in addition to general market conditions, future market growth will be driven largely
by new technologies and new content. Our ability to sustain growth in revenue and our customer base despite the
increased competition that has resulted from this market saturation will depend in large part upon our ability to
retain our existing subscribers, convince subscribers to switch from competing carriers to our services, and to
stimulate and increase usage. We may not achieve these aims if we are not able to enhance our existing mobile
products and services and to develop, introduce and market new mobile technologies, products and services. If
we fail to increase revenue from or expand our subscriber base in our mobile business in the face of market
saturation, our business, financial condition and results of operation could be materially adversely affected.

**_Our business is subject to rapid changes in technology and if we fail to lead or respond to technological_**
**_developments, our business may be adversely affected._**

Our landline, mobile, internet and cable TV operations may not be successful if we fail to lead or keep
pace with continuing changes in technology and provide new or enhanced services in a timely and cost-effective
manner, or to successfully anticipate the product demands of our customers. Recently, the market has witnessed
the emergence of new technologies such as VoIP, ADSL2+, FTTH and Ethernet. We expect technological
innovation to continue rapidly across all product lines. We will need to anticipate and react to these changes and
to develop or apply new and enhanced products and services quickly enough for the changing market Otherwise


-----

rendering our current systems obsolete. For example, SIP based technologies delivering VoIP and other
communications services over broadband may make PSTN technology obsolete. ADSL2+, VDSL2 and FTTH
based solutions may make the current DSL technology limited to 8 Mbps obsolete. Ethernet technology which
reduces the cost level for IP aggregation considerably may make ATM technology obsolete.

Technological advancements could also result in the need to make substantial investments in new or
enhanced technologies, products or services. We may not be able to adopt such technology due to insufficient
funding to make the necessary capital expenditures, or if such technology is subject to third-party patents.
Conversely, if we do succeed in introducing new technologies in the telecommunications market, such
technologies may not prove commercially viable in the long run, and consequently we may risk being unable to
earn an adequate return on, or recover the costs of, our investments in developing and marketing products that
rely on these technologies.

**_Failure to control customer churn may adversely affect our business._**

Customer churn is a measure of customers who stop subscribing to our services. Churn arises mainly as a
result of new housing development, relocation of subscribers and price decreases by our competitors. In addition,
our customer churn rate may also increase as a result of competitive developments or if we are unable to deliver
satisfactory services over our network. Any interruption of our services or other customer service problems could
also contribute to an increase in customer churn. Any increase in customer churn may lead to a need to reduce
our costs rapidly to preserve our margins and reduced revenue or, alternatively, to increase our marketing costs in
an attempt to keep or bring back customers. There can be no assurance that the various measures we have taken
to increase customer loyalty will reduce the rate of churn.

Furthermore, the mobile telecommunications market is characterized by frequent developments in
product offerings, as well as by advances in network and handset technology. If we fail to maintain and upgrade
our network and provide our customers with an attractive portfolio of products and services, we may not be able
to retain our customers. Additionally, if competing mobile operators improve their ability to attract new
customers, or offer their products and services at lower prices, it could become more difficult for us to retain our
current customers, and our costs of acquiring new customers could increase.

**_We may face significant capital expenditures going forward driven mostly by investments in new technologies_**
**_and infrastructure including our network and information technology systems. We cannot assure you that we_**
**_will have sufficient liquidity to fund our capital programs or our ongoing operations in the future._**

Our business is capital intensive and has always required significant amounts of cash. We have a capital
expenditure program which will continue to require significant capital outlays in the foreseeable future, including
the continued development of our GSM and UMTS networks, cable TV business, maintenance of our network
backbones, our continuing fiber network roll out including FTTN and investments in new IT systems, including
customer care and billing systems. The utility companies expect to roll out FTTH to 40%, or approximately one
million, of Danish households. The Danish Competition Authority has estimated that this will require
investments by the utility companies of DKK 9.5 billion (€1.3 billion). Although we now have more than 23,000
kilometers of fiber network, primarily in the backbone network, competition from utility companies may put
pressure on us to invest more heavily in both FTTN and in FTTH.

Although we may have an advanced network, we may need to invest in new networks and technologies in the
future, such as Next Generation Networks, which could require significant capital expenditures, and network usage
may develop faster than we anticipate, requiring greater capital investments in shorter time frames than we anticipate.
However, we may not have the resources available to make such investments. In addition, costs associated with the
licenses needed to operate our existing networks and technologies including UMTS and those that we develop in the
future, and costs and rental expenses related to their deployment could be considerable. See “— A favorable market for
UMTS-based 3G services may not develop, limiting our ability to recoup the cost of our investments in UMTS
services and the UMTS licenses and networks which could adversely affect our results of operations.” The amount and
timing of our future capital requirements may differ materially from our current estimates due to various factors, many
of which are beyond our control and we cannot assure you that we will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to
meet our capital expenditure needs, sustain our operations or meet our other capital requirements. See “ Operating and
Financial Review and Prospects — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”


-----

Approximately 30% of our 2005 revenue was generated outside Denmark and the euro area. This revenue
originates primarily from Switzerland, Lithuania, Sweden and Norway, where we conduct our business
operations and prepare our financial statements in currencies other than the Danish kroner or the euro. Any loss
in the value of these currencies against the Danish kroner will have a negative impact on the value of our
investments in the relevant business activities and the amount of income we derive from them.

Our reporting currency is the Danish kroner. Following the Transactions and the notes offering hereunder,
we will have U.S. dollar denominated debt obligations under the notes. Accordingly, we are vulnerable to foreign
exchange rate fluctuations. Any decrease in the value of the Danish kroner compared with the U.S. dollar could
have an impact on our ability to service debt and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results
and financial position.

**_We are exposed to interest-rate risks._**

Our borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities are subject to floating interest rates. An increase in
interest rates could increase our payment obligations and could have a material adverse effect on our operating
results and financial position. We would also be exposed to floating interest rates associated with the Floating
Rate Notes. We are required to hedge a portion of our floating rate debt pursuant to the Senior Facilities
Agreement. Hedging may be expensive to maintain and may not protect us adequately against adverse
movements in interest rates.

**_A favorable market for UMTS-based 3G services may not develop, limiting our ability to recoup the cost of our_**
**_investments in UMTS services and the UMTS licenses and networks, which could adversely affect our results_**
**_of operations._**

Our UMTS-based 3G service has required us to make substantial investments in UMTS services and
UMTS licenses and networks. We have UMTS licenses in Denmark, Latvia, Lithuania and Switzerland.
Polkomtel has a UMTS license in Poland and One has a UMTS license in Austria. Our Danish UMTS license fee
will cost approximately DKK 950 million (€127 million) in aggregate. We paid 25% of the license fee upfront in
2001 and have subsequently paid four instalments of 7.5% each. The remaining 45% is to be paid in six yearly
instalments ending 2011. As required under the terms of our license, we achieved coverage of 30% of the
population at the end of 2004, but must achieve a coverage of 80% by the end of 2008, which may require us to
make substantial investments in the upcoming years. Our Danish UMTS license expires October 31, 2021. Our
Swiss UMTS license fee cost 50 million Swiss francs and will expire at the end of 2016. The license fee was paid
upfront. As required under the terms of our license, we achieved coverage of 50% of the population at the end of
2004.

Although certain markets for UMTS currently exist, if UMTS does not gain further acceptance or deliver
anticipated advantages, or if we derive a smaller percentage of our revenue than expected from our UMTSrelated 3G services, we may not be able to adequately recoup our investment in our UMTS licenses and
networks. This may be the case even if we follow a strategy of making further significant investments in UMTS
only when it is clear that UMTS use is becoming mainstream. UMTS technology needs further development in
order to provide the expected advantages over existing GSM technology and rival competing mobile broadband
technologies. Demand for UMTS-based 3G services may not develop to the extent that we anticipate.
Accordingly, no assurance can be given that a larger market for UMTS services will develop or that we will be
able to achieve our desired sales volumes for UMTS services. Moreover, competition from WLAN and CDMA/
450 MHz may adversely affect the penetration of UMTS and associated data services. Substitution technologies
including WiMAX and WiFi which also offer radio voice and data transmission solutions, may pose a threat to
the growth of the UMTS market. Push-to-talk (walkie-talkie) and instant messaging may also pose a threat to the
UMTS market in the future. We also face the risk that our UMTS customers will use lower margin packet
transmission services (“Packet Side” traffic) rather than higher margin voice transmission services (“Circuit
Side” traffic), thereby threatening the profitability of our UMTS business.

Furthermore, we rely on applications developers to develop services that will stimulate market demand
for 3G services and our UMTS network. If third-party application service providers fail to develop such services,
or experience delays in their development of such services, our ability to generate revenue from our UMTS
network may be adversely affected


-----

and speed. If we cannot obtain such equipment and software or if we experience delays in their delivery or
functional deployment, our ability to develop our UMTS network and our customers’ ability to access it will be
impaired. Availability of this equipment and software is the required driver of demand for these services.

**_Market acceptance of our online telephony services, including our self-service products and e-commerce_**
**_services, is still uncertain._**

Our online services, including our self-service telephony products, and e-commerce services such as TDC
Online are relatively new offerings in the telecommunications market. Consequently, there is uncertainty
concerning market demand for, or profitability of, such products and services. If customer service costs turn out
to be higher than expected, future profit margins could be affected. Moreover, it is uncertain if and how fast the
expected efficiency savings resulting from such movement to online services may be realized.

**_Equipment and network systems are vulnerable to terrorist attacks, natural disasters, security risks and other_**
**_events that may disrupt our services and result in increased costs or lost revenue. In addition, terrorism laws_**
**_and regulations might result in a heavier regulatory burden on our business and increased operating costs._**

The performance, reliability and availability of our networks and our mobile and fixed line
telecommunication services are critical to our ability to attract and retain subscribers. Our networks and the
services we provide may be subject to damage or disruptions resulting from terrorist acts and numerous other
events, including fire, flood or other natural disasters, power outages and equipment or system failures (“major
disruption events”). Our network has been affected by floods and storms in the past. If a major disruption event
were to affect our infrastructure or a third party’s systems, and were to result in a failure of our networks or
systems or of the third party-owned local and long distance networks on which we rely for the provision of
interconnection and roaming services to our subscribers, it could affect the quality of our services or cause
temporary service interruptions, which could result in customer dissatisfaction, regulatory penalties and reduced
revenue. The occurrence of network or system failure could also harm our reputation or impair our ability to
attract new customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and result
of operations. There can be no assurance that our business continuity plans, network security policies, the
vulnerability analysis we conduct jointly with regulators or our monitoring activities will mitigate the impact of
or prevent a disruption event.

In addition, our business is dependent on certain sophisticated critical systems, including exchanges,
switches, other key network points and our billing and customer service systems. The hardware supporting those
systems is housed in a relatively small number of locations and if damage were to occur to any of such locations,
or if those systems develop other problems, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.

A substantial part of our network is not insured. In the event any losses due to terrorist acts and numerous
other events, including fire, flood or other natural disasters, power outages and equipment or system failures, are
not covered by insurance, we may not have the capital to make necessary repairs or replacements.

A significantly higher regulatory burden on our business prompted by terrorism or similar threats would
increase our costs. As part of the anti-terrorism action plan passed by the Danish government in November 2005,
the government has proposed requiring telecommunications operators to use or install communication
interception equipment and to establish databases for mandatory retention of traffic passing through their
networks in order to assist law enforcement agencies in tracking terrorist activity. If such measures are adopted,
we may need to make additional investments on technical equipment and we may incur operational costs as a
result. Such regulation substantially increases our potential data retention obligations, requiring us to keep traffic
data well beyond what we need for legitimate business purposes. These requirements are expected to cause
substantial costs, with no possibility of cost recovery from the public authorities. See “—Risks Related to
Regulatory Matters and Litigation.”

**_We expect that our increasing dependency on digitalized information technology systems exposes us to risks of_**
**_hacking, piracy and systems failure, which potentially could disrupt our business._**

The telecommunications sector has become increasingly digitalized, automated and online, which means
that we are exposed to increasing risks of hacking, piracy and general failure of IT systems. Unanticipated IT
problems, system failures, computer viruses or hacker attacks could affect the quality of our services and cause
service interruptions. Risks of network failure can never be completely eliminated and the occurrence of such
failures may reduce revenue and harm our reputation


-----

In order to maintain and improve our profitability as we face continuing pricing pressure due to
competition, and to take advantage of the cost-saving potential of our new online self-service products, we need
to make a sizeable reduction in our workforce over the next few years. Any reduction to our workforce may
entail significant severance costs, which may affect our earnings. Many of our employees in Denmark have civil
servant pension rights and some of them are entitled to severance benefits. We believe that the total costs related
to workforce reductions in 2006 will be DKK 342 million (€45.8 million) after tax. The costs relating to
workforce reductions may be higher than we anticipate and may have a material impact on our profitability.

In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement sizeable reductions in our
workforce. Although Danish law does not impose significant restrictions on workforce reductions, and our labor
unions do not have a right under Danish law to veto any reductions in our workforce, there can be no assurance
that any workforce reduction will not lead to strikes, work stoppages or other industrial actions. We have entered
into “Borgfredsaftaler,” collective agreements, with each of the telecommunications departments of the Danish
Metal Workers Union (Dansk Metal) (“DMWU”), the Association of Managers and Employees in Special
Positions of Trust in TDC (Lederforeningen i TDC, LTD) (“AME”) and the Danish Confederation of
Professional Associations (AC-organsiationerne) (“DC”) (collectively, the “Borgfredsaftale unions”). In these
Borgfredsaftaler, we have agreed to follow certain procedural guidelines in connection with the implementation
of reductions in our workforce, including providing redundant employees with training that would make them
suitable for reassignment within TDC in certain circumstances. The Borgfredsaftaler expire at the end of 2007,
however they may be terminated by us or the unions subject to three months notice in the event the assumptions
behind the agreements lapse or change.

We also have entered into collective agreements with the Borgfredsaftale unions regarding the terms and
conditions of voluntary resignations by employees as an incentive to encourage voluntary resignations. These
agreements may be terminated by either party subject to two months notice. Neither the reductions in our
workforce nor the scope of such reductions are part of these agreements.

Even though we have agreements with these unions relating to procedures for workforce reductions and
the terms and conditions of voluntary resignations, there can be no assurance that any of our labor unions will not
resist further workforce reductions. In addition, we may not be able to negotiate agreements with the
Borgfredsaftale unions after 2007 similar to the Borgfredsaftaler. See “— Strikes or other industrial actions could
disrupt our operations or make it more costly to operate our facilities” below.

During the last three years, we implemented two overall redundancy programs: the first covering the
period 2003 to 2004 and the second covering 2005. In 2005, due to our international acquisition activity, our total
number of employees and the number of our international employees increased. We expect our number of
employees to increase in the event we continue to make acquisitions. In 2005, we did manage to reduce our
number of domestic full-time employees from 14,437 to 13,876. A redundancy program has also been
implemented in 2006, pursuant to which we expect to reduce staff by up to 570 employees. We cannot assure you
that we will be able to implement redundancy programs in the future or that any of our redundancy programs will
be effective.

**_Strikes or other industrial actions could disrupt our operations or make it more costly to operate our facilities._**

We are exposed to the risk of strikes and other industrial actions. We estimate that more than 70% of
our employees are union members. As noted above, we have entered into Borgfredsaftaler with each of the
Borgfredsaftale unions, which provide for certain procedural guidelines to be followed in connection with the
implementation of reductions in our workforce until the end of 2007. Pursuant to our Borgfredsaftaler with the
telecommunications departments of the DMWU, the parties thereto have agreed to enter into dialogue within
24 hours in the face of an imminent conflict in order to prevent industrial action. As noted above, we have also
entered into separate agreements with each of the Borgfredsaftale unions regarding the terms and conditions of
voluntary resignations by employees as an incentive to encourage voluntary resignations. These agreements
may be terminated by either party with two months notice. There can be no assurance that the Borgfredsaftaler
with the Borgfredsaftale unions or our collective labor agreements will prevent strikes, work stoppages or
other industrial actions in the future. Any industrial action we experience might disrupt our operations,
including our repair times, possibly for a significant period of time, result in increased wages and benefits or
otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. See
“—In order to improve our profitability, we need to implement a sizeable reduction in our existing workforce,
which may be costly and difficult to implement” above


-----

Due to our existing legacy network, we are dependent on certain suppliers for the maintenance and
upgrade of certain hardware and software platforms, especially such hardware or software platforms that have
become industry standard. For example, our cable TV business has made substantial investments in the
equipment and software of particular suppliers, making it difficult for us in the short term to change supply and
maintenance relationships in the event that our initial supplier refuses to offer us favorable prices or ceases to
produce equipment or provide the support that our telecommunications and cable TV networks and systems
require. In the past, some of our key suppliers have stopped providing us with hardware that we use, such as the
AC4 SDH platform, and certain support services, such as feature development for ATM based DSL platforms
(without which triple play products are impossible on such platform), DSL line card delivery on certain older
DSL platforms and upgrades for PSTN platforms.
Any discontinuance of certain products or services or failure to upgrade such products and services by our
suppliers, any financial instability of our suppliers or failure by such supplier to deliver certain products to us
pursuant to our supplier contracts in the future could lead to the risk of:

Š delays to upgrades and new products and features from suppliers, impacting our product development
programs,

Š products being discontinued, impacting supply of existing products,

Š deteriorating quality of support services, affecting operational and customer services,

Š higher volatility with regard to our demands on suppliers, and in stock levels affected by customer
returned equipment, and

Š consequential impact on our business.
Failure on the part of our suppliers, which may in turn delay or prevent us from providing our own
products and services to our customers, may adversely impact our revenue. We may not be able to recover
monies paid to such suppliers for their products and services or obtain contractual damages, when applicable, in
such an event. In addition, any increase in pricing by our suppliers may cause a margin squeeze. The above
factors could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.
Even though in most cases our equipment and software suppliers can be replaced, switching to alternative
suppliers could cause us to experience difficulty or delays in providing support and maintenance, new products
and upgrades and operational services, or result in significant cost increases, which could harm our financial
condition and operating results.

**_We are party to a number of different contracts with third parties which contain change of control provisions._**
**_If one or more of the change of control clauses are exercised, this may adversely affect our business and_**
**_profitability._**

We have important co-operation agreements and contracts with suppliers and service providers and hold
insurance policies which are subject to change of control provisions. Exercise of change of control provisions by
third parties in certain material contracts may adversely affect our competitiveness and profitability.
Should any of our contractual relationships be terminated, we may be forced to enter into new contracts
which may be on less favorable terms. Moreover, the termination of one or more of our co-operation agreements
may lead to loss of business from certain supplementary service providers, which we may not be able to maintain
through independent relationships.

**_We depend on a small number of distributors, retailers and sales agencies (“mobile distributors”) to distribute_**
**_or sell our mobile products and services to end users. Our mobile distributors may stop distributing our mobile_**
**_products to end users and may have distribution agreements with our competitors._**

We distribute our mobile products and services in cooperation with a small number of mobile distributors.
In Denmark 35% of our sales are distributed through a small number of mobile distributors. In Switzerland, over
40% of our sales are distributed through a few mobile distributors. Under our current arrangements with our key
mobile distributors, our mobile distributors may stop distributing or selling our products at any time. Should this
occur, we may face difficulty in finding new mobile distributors that can provide the same level of sales. In
addition, our mobile distributors have distribution agreements with our competitors. These distribution
agreements with our competitors may negatively affect the level of our gross activations through our distribution
partners, threatening our market share, and thus adversely affecting our financial condition and results of
operations. Our mobile distributors may more actively promote the products and services of our competitors to
our detriment. Our failure to maintain key distribution relationships, or the failure of our distribution partners to
procure sufficient customers for us for any reason, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition
and result of operations


-----

Our ability to provide high quality mobile and fixed line telecommunications services outside of Denmark
depends on our ability to interconnect with the telecommunications networks and services of other mobile and
fixed line operators, particularly those of our larger competitors. Outside of Denmark, we also rely on third party
operators for the provision of international roaming services for our mobile subscribers. For example, in
Switzerland we depend on Swisscom’s ULL to reach a significant number of end users. While we have
interconnection and roaming agreements in place with other operators, we have no direct control over the quality
of their networks and the interconnections and roaming services they provide. Any difficulties or delays in
interconnecting with other networks and services, or the failure of any operator to provide reliable
interconnection services to us on a consistent basis, could result in a loss of subscribers or a decrease in traffic,
which would reduce our revenue and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

Outside of Denmark, we depend on access to the incumbent’s facilities to install our ULL facilities. If the
incumbent fails to allow us access to these facilities, or is slower in allowing access than we anticipate, our
ability to roll out additional direct access products and attract direct access customers may be adversely affected.

**_Our minority shareholdings in the mobile telephony industry, and the fact that we only own 63.4% of HTCC,_**
**_expose our business to ill-informed or inadequate management decisions made on behalf of companies of_**
**_which we do not have full control and may require strategic and financial support._**

The performance of the international operators in which we have minority interests and of HTCC may
depend on the financial or strategic support of other shareholders. We only own 15% of Austrian mobile operator
One and 19.6% of Polish mobile operator Polkomtel (which is in the process of being sold). Even though we own
a majority interest in HTCC of 63.4% of the share capital, we may not be able to exercise full control over its
operations. Such international operators may rely on us and/or other shareholders for strategic and financial
support. Such other shareholders may fail to supply or not be willing to supply the required operational, strategic
and financial resources relating to, for example, the build-out of infrastructure, the cost of meeting regulatory
requirements or effective marketing, which could adversely affect both the ability of these operations to compete
and the return on our investment.

**_The loss of important intellectual property rights, including our key trademarks and domain names, could_**
**_adversely affect our competitiveness._**

Some of our intellectual property rights, including our key trademarks and domain names which are well
known in the telecommunications markets in which we operate, are important to our business. A significant part
of our revenue is derived from products and services marketed under the brand names TDC or sunrise. We rely
upon a combination of trademark laws, copyright and data base protection as well as, where appropriate,
contractual arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We are required from time to
time to bring claims against third parties in order to protect our property rights which may not succeed in
protecting such rights.

In addition to the risk that a third party will infringe on our intellectual property rights, we face the risk
that a third party may claim that we are infringing on such third party’s intellectual property rights, including but
not limited to, patent rights. As a result, we may not be able to use intellectual property that is material to the
operation of our business. Alternatively, a third party may allege one of our suppliers is infringing on such third
party’s intellectual property rights and may bring suit to prevent such supplier from providing us with products or
services important to our business.

We cannot be sure that any lawsuits or other actions brought by us to protect our intellectual property
rights will be successful or that such suppliers will not be found to infringe the intellectual property rights of
third parties. Although we are not aware of any material infringements of any intellectual property rights that are
significant to our business, any lawsuits, regardless of their outcome, could result in substantial costs and
diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operations. The illegal use by third parties or the loss of our important intellectual property rights, such as our
trademarks and domain names, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and
results of operation. If we are prevented from using certain products and services or if we are forced to pay
significant damages or higher prices for important products or services due to a third party’s successful
intellectual property claim, there may be a material adverse effect on our business.

**_A loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business._**

Our success is largely dependent on the skills, experience and efforts of our senior management,
including our Chief Executive Officer Henning Dyremose who has held his current position since 1998 and was


-----

team could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition,
as our business develops and expands, we believe that our future success will depend on our continued ability to
attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel without increased labor costs. We cannot assure you that
we will be able to continue to employ key personnel or that we will be able to attract and retain qualified
personnel in the future, especially in light of Denmark’s tight labor market with very low unemployment. Any
failure by us to retain or attract such key personnel could materially and adversely affect our business, results of
operations and financial condition. See “Management—Employment Agreements for Members of the Executive
Committee.”

**_A downturn in general economic conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and_**
**_operating results._**
Any downturn in the global economy, European economy or the economy of any of the countries in
which we operate may adversely affect our business. The financial prospects in our markets are currently
uncertain due to, among other things, the rise of oil prices throughout 2004 and 2005. A major terrorist attack in
Europe might also cause a downturn in the markets in which we operate. In addition, some Danish businesses are
being subjected to a boycott linked to protests related to the publication of cartoons in a Danish newspaper; if this
boycott were to continue, it could potentially have a harmful effect on the Danish economy generally. If the
Danish business outlook is cautious or negative, our customers may delay or cancel investments in
telecommunications systems and services, which may adversely affect our revenue and the development of new
products and services. Any decrease in economic activity may generally decrease network traffic and demand for
data storage.

**_Our failure to meet growing customer demand for content services and adapt to technological developments in_**
**_content delivery may not only negatively impact the growth of our content services business, but may also_**
**_decrease the market share of our bundled products with a content component._**
Our cable TV business has given us significant experience with and access to the content market and
content delivery products. However, our future success in content services will depend on our ability to produce
or acquire attractive programming such as popular TV shows, music and games and to adapt and lead
technological developments in content delivery applications. There can be no assurance that we will be able to
acquire popular content in the future. One of our major content suppliers for cable TV competes with us in
certain TVoIP markets and has so far refused to allow us to provide its content on our TVoIP product at prices
that are acceptable to us. This may have a materially adverse impact on the growth of our TVoIP business.
Moreover, the telecommunications sector is undergoing advances in content services as technological
developments increasingly enable customers to receive content whenever they wish (such as digital video
recorders or time-shift software for a PC with TV-card), and wherever they wish (such as MPEG4/H.264videopodcasts for iPods and other portable digital media players or 3G/DVB-H transmissions for handsets). Not
only do we face the risk that we will fall behind our competitors in terms of content delivery technology, but also
that the platforms, applications or technology we invest in will not become the market standard. Growth in
content services is expected to be driven by an increase in the quantitative and qualitative capabilities of content
providers. However, the specific extent and characteristics of such quantitative and qualitative progress are
difficult to predict at present. Also, we may not be able to match the quantitative or qualitative capabilities of our
competitors. In addition, failure to provide content services may also negatively impact sales of our products and
services with a bundled content component, such as cable TV, broadband, triple play and 3G, or to which our
competitors have added a bundled content component.

**_Our business may be adversely affected by the alleged health risks from the use of mobile telephones and by_**
**_other environmental requirements._**
We are subject to regulations and guidelines relating to radio frequency emissions and other forms of
non-ionizing radiation. We are aware of allegations that there may be health risks, including some forms of
cancer, associated with such emissions from mobile telephones and from other mobile telecommunications
devices.
The European Commission has been investigating these concerns since 1995. Although the results of
these studies have been inconclusive, we cannot provide assurances that further medical research and studies will
not establish a link between the radio frequency emissions of mobile handsets and health concerns. The EU and
Danish or Swiss authorities could increase regulation of mobile telephones and base stations as a result of such
health concerns. In Switzerland in particular, public concern over alleged adverse health effects related to
electromagnetic radiation and strict Swiss rules on radiation may result in increased costs related to the GSM and
UMTS networks and thereby impeding both the continuation of our 2G and the growth of our 3G mobile
telephony business


-----

customer base, a decline in our ARPU and AMOU, increased regulatory burdens on us or significant litigation
costs, and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

In addition, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to land use and the protection of
the environment, including those governing the storage, management and disposal of hazardous materials and the
cleanup of contaminated sites. We could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, sanctions and
third-party claims for property damage and personal injury, as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, such
laws and regulations. We believe, however, that we are in substantial compliance with such laws and regulations.

**Risks Related to Regulatory Matters and Litigation**

**_The regulatory framework for the Danish telecommunications sector may result in tougher competition,_**
**_further reductions of tariffs and decreased profit margins for our business. In addition, we have been_**
**_designated by NITA as having significant market power (“SMP”) in Denmark in a number of submarkets._**

Denmark’s regulatory regime governing its telecommunications sector requires us to deliver a broad
range of products to the retail and wholesale markets, and subjects us to price regulation.

_EU Regulatory Framework._ In March 2002, the EU passed a number of directives designed to promote
competition in the telecommunications market that were subsequently implemented into Danish law in 2003. In
accordance with this legislation, NITA performs market analyses on 18 specifically defined submarkets with
respect to landline telephony, mobile telephony, leased lines, unbundled access, broadband and TV and radio
transmission. In each submarket, NITA may designate a dominant telecommunications operator as having SMP
in such submarket. If imperfections in a submarket in which an operator has been designated as having SMP are
identified, NITA may impose remedies against such operator in order to promote competition. In the wholesale
market, such measures may include the acceptance of a reasonable request for interconnection,
non-discrimination, reference offers, transparency, accounting separation, specific cost accounting obligations
and price control methods. NITA has so far issued decisions on 14 out of 18 submarkets. Final decisions for all
the submarkets, except the submarket for television and radio transmission, are expected during the first half of
2006. Until market analyses of the relevant submarkets have been completed and NITA has decided whether to
adopt new regulatory measures or revoke former measures, the current regulation will be maintained in each
relevant submarket.

_SMP Designation._ We have been designated as having SMP by NITA in almost all of the submarkets in
Denmark, except for Market 15 (the wholesale market for mobile access) and Markets 5 and 6 (the retail markets
for national and international traffic for business customers). As a result of our SMP designation, we are subject
to additional regulatory burdens, which are summarized below. In addition, NITA has been considering whether
to create an additional submarket for cable TV networks. If NITA creates a cable TV submarket, it is likely we
would be designated as having SMP in the cable TV market and might be required to provide third parties with
access to our cable network. There can be no assurance that NITA will not impose additional regulatory burdens
on us as a result of our current SMP status or designate us as having SMP in additional markets.

_Retail Markets._ As a result of our SMP status, the larger part of our retail offerings of leased lines must
comply with a rule of cost orientation. As a result, we are required to calibrate leased line prices annually to
ensure that they match the corresponding cost plus a mark-up set by the regulatory authorities.

_Wholesale Markets._ In the wholesale markets in which we have SMP status, the majority of our prices
are regulated as a result of our SMP designation. Until 2002, interconnection prices were regulated mainly on the
basis of historical cost analyses and best-practice benchmarking against corresponding international prices. Since
January 1, 2003, NITA has set the prices we charge for switched interconnection traffic, interconnection
capacity, shared access and ULL (also known as raw copper) as well as related co-location. NITA calculates
these prices once a year in accordance with the LRAIC model and evaluates and updates the LRAIC model once
every three years. Only minor price adjustments were implemented in 2004 and 2005. In early 2006, the LRAIC
model was adjusted and the prices for ULL, switched interconnection traffic and interconnection capacity were
decreased considerably. The decrease may have a negative impact on our revenue and earnings. The prices for
TDC’s other interconnection products are based on historical costs according to a formula set by NITA. It is
uncertain how this pricing method will affect TDC’s future prices. Furthermore, the telecommunications law was
amended with effect from January 1, 2006, resulting in changes in calculation principles for depreciation,
amortization and interest payments. Such changes will likely result in price decreases for bitstream access and
leased lines. The amended law also gives the NITA increased power to stipulate specific terms and conditions for
TDC’s interconnection agreements


-----

Discontinuation of geographical differentiation of prices for bitstream access will strengthen our competitors in
remote areas, where production of bitstream access is very costly for us. Alternatively, we may decide to let the
current differentiation of wholesale prices affect our end user prices. The decision also requires us to offer
wholesale broadband solutions (bitstream access) without compulsory landline subscriptions, which will improve
our competitors’ conditions for offering broadband solutions combined with IP telephony. We have appealed the
decision for this market and some of the other decisions to the Telecommunications Complaints Board.

The authorities have announced that they may intervene in the pricing of traditional landline subscriptions
for customers who also have broadband subscriptions in order to address the so-called “excess cost recovery
problem.” The formulation of such intervention and its impact on TDC’s earnings are uncertain.

In the market for termination of mobile calls, NITA has decided that TDC, TeliaSonera, Sonofon, Tele2
and Hi3G have SMP. However, price regulation has been introduced only for TDC, Sonofon and TeliaSonera,
whose average price (including call set-up fee) must be reduced by approximately 35% over the next two years.
This decision will adversely impact our earnings. If the domestic market for international roaming also becomes
subject to price regulation, such regulation may have a negative impact on TDC Mobil’s revenue and earnings.

Decisions have also been made on four retail submarkets for telephony traffic, the retail market for leased
lines, the wholesale markets for fixed connections, unbundled access and shared use including co-location, as
well as for fixed termination. None of the decisions include significant changes in relation to existing regulation
with the exception of regulations relating to extended access related to co-location and extended requirements to
guarantee the line quality against disturbances.

_Anti-Terror Measures._ As part of the anti-terrorism action plan passed by the Danish government in
November 2005, the government has proposed a bill requiring telecommunications operators to use or install
communication interception equipment and to establish databases for mandatory retention of traffic passing
through their networks in order to assist law enforcement agencies in tracking terrorist activity. If such measures
are adopted, we may have to make additional investments in technical equipment and we may incur operational
costs as a result.

_EU Universal Service Obligation (USO) directive._ Pursuant to the EU USO directive and Danish USO
regulation, which are designed to ensure that all end users have access to certain basic telecommunications
services regardless of their geographical location at an affordable price, NITA has designated us as the Universal
Service Provider (“USP”) in Denmark. In the past NITA fixed the prices that we could charge to our Danish
customers who use PSTN services (“USO customers”) for PSTN services, but these price caps were lifted at the
end of 2005. We face the risk that NITA will decide to reintroduce a price cap on the products and services we
offer to our USO customers. In addition, we face uncertainty concerning the renewal of our USP designation
after 2007, which may affect our revenue and earnings.

_EU Roaming Charge Regulation._ The EU Commission is currently considering new regulations
designed to cut international roaming charges. It is unclear what would be the outcome of such regulations if
imposed. However, such regulation could have a negative impact on TDC Mobile International’s revenue and
earnings.

**_Certain regulatory contingencies in Switzerland may have a material adverse effect on our Swiss business._**

Prompted by a preliminary decision by the Swiss competition authority regarding abuse of market power
by Swisscom, the Swiss incumbent, in 2005, Swisscom reduced its prices for terminating mobile calls, putting
heavy pressure on other Swiss mobile operators, including TDC Switzerland, to reduce their tariffs as well. The
Swiss competition authority is continuing its review of the level of competition in the mobile call termination
market and is currently investigating whether the Swiss mobile operators, including TDC Switzerland, have a
dominant position and, if so, abuse such position. Consequently, TDC Switzerland faces the possibility that the
Swiss competition authority will require Swisscom and/or TDC Switzerland to make further price reductions for
terminating mobile calls. Such price reductions, if imposed on TDC Switzerland, may have a material adverse
effect on the earning and profit margins of our Swiss operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the
Swiss competition authority will not impose a material fine upon TDC Switzerland if the Swiss competition
authority determines that TDC Switzerland has a dominant position in the mobile call termination market and has
abused such position.

Our Swiss business benefits from regulations requiring Swisscom to grant other telecommunications
operators, including us, interconnection services under cost-based terms and conditions. Swisscom has
challenged the interconnection tariffs as set by the Swiss Communication Commission (“ComCom”) in court In


-----

Supreme Court, TDC Switzerland may have to pay higher than expected prices to use Swisscom’s landline
network.

Our business plan and earnings forecasts, particularly in relation to expected broadband and triple play
sales, anticipate that the Swiss legislature will enact legislation requiring Swiss telecommunications operators to
open their local loop networks to other operators. Such regulations would allow TDC Switzerland to lease
network capacity on Swisscom’s ULL and gain access to Swisscom’s customers. A revised telecommunications
law providing for such opening of ULL networks was passed by the Swiss Parliament on March 24, 2006. A 100day referendum period expires on July 13, 2006. If there is no referendum and the ordinances implementing the
new law are finalized, the new law enters into force. Although unlikely, it is possible that organizations opposed
to the law could force a public vote, which would further delay enactment by at least a year and could potentially
result in enactment being prevented. Once the law is enacted, vested interests may attempt to prevent, impede or
delay access to the ULL networks through other measures. If ULL terms and conditions are not set and enforced
in a favorable way, we might have to adjust our business plan and earnings forecast.

**_The licenses for the key technologies underlying our service offerings have finite terms and the failure to_**
**_renew one of these licenses upon termination, or our inability to obtain new licenses for new technologies,_**
**_could adversely affect our business._**

We are licensed by NITA to provide mobile telecommunications services in Denmark and by the Swiss
regulator to provide mobile telecommunications services in Switzerland. For example, we have UMTS licenses
to provide 3G services in Denmark and Switzerland, three GSM licenses in Denmark (including licenses for DCS
1800, DC56 and GSM, respectively) and one GSM licence in Switzerland. Our Danish and Swiss UMTS licenses
are valid until October 31, 2021 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our Danish GSM licenses are valid until
June 12, 2007, January 1, 2011 and March 1, 2012, respectively and our Swiss GSM license is valid until
May 31, 2008. There can be no assurance that NITA or the Swiss regulator will not withdraw our existing
licenses if we can not meet license conditions, including obtaining the regulator’s consent in the event of a
change of control. After their respective expiration dates, we will have to reapply for a new Danish UMTS
license and new Swiss GSM and UMTS licenses. There can be no assurance that any application for renewal of
such licenses will be successful. The three Danish GSM licenses will be extended automatically for periods of 10
years unless NITA, at its discretion, issues a decision not to extend such licenses, which decision must be made
one year before the scheduled expiry date. In the event that we are unable to renew a license or obtain a new
license for any technology that is important for the provision of our service offerings, we could be forced to
discontinue use of that technology and our financial condition and result of operations could be materially
adversely affected.

**_We face various litigation and commercial dispute risks that could have a material adverse effect on our_**
**_results of operations._**

You should review “Business — Legal Proceedings” for a summary of significant litigation and
investigations which you should carefully consider before making a decision to invest in the notes. Any such
litigation or investigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of
operations or otherwise distract attention from management.

Pursuant to the change of control provisions in Polkomtel’s bylaws and the shareholder agreement among
Polkomtel’s shareholders, as a result of our recent change of control, TDC is required to offer to sell its 19.6%
ownership share to the other shareholders of Polkomtel. In February 2006 TDC offered its shares for a price of
€214.04 per share. On March 10, 2006, the Polish shareholders in Polkomtel entered into an agreement with TDC
whereby, subject to certain conditions including the outcome of the Vodafone litigation described below, they
agreed to exercise their right to purchase their pro rata share of 14.8% of the share capital of Polkomtel for an
aggregate price of €650.5 million. The remainder of TDC’s shareholding in Polkomtel, 4.8%, has been offered to
Vodafone, the only shareholder of Polkomtel who has not entered into the purchase agreement with TDC.
Vodafone has claimed that the offer procedure is invalid and that the offer price determined by TDC does not
reflect the market value of the Polkomtel shares. Vodafone also maintains that the price at which TDC’s shares in
Polkomtel should be offered for sale to Vodafone and the other shareholders should be determined in arbitration.
Legal proceedings are pending in the Polish courts and the International Arbitral Center in Vienna. Upon
Vodafone’s motion, the District Court in Warsaw, Poland has issued an injunction which prohibits TDC from
transferring any of its shares in Polkomtel. Vodafone has initiated arbitration against TDC. If these proceedings
are determined adversely to TDC TDC may be required to sell its shares in Polkomtel for less than the €214 04


-----

At the EGM held on February 28, 2006, the Purchaser proposed that TDC seek to delist its shares and
ADSs from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and from the NYSE, respectively, and subsequently seek to
deregister all securities from the U.S. Exchange Act. The Purchaser also proposed the introduction of a new
clause into the articles of association of TDC permitting the compulsory acquisition of the shares of minority
shareholders. These proposals attained an affirmative vote of over 90% of the share capital of TDC represented at
the EGM and such resolutions were declared passed by the EGM. Subsequently, the DCCA ruled that it would
not register the new articles of association. Further, ATP, a Danish pension fund holding 5.5% of the shares in
TDC, has filed a writ with the Copenhagen City Court (which has been passed on to the Eastern High Court)
against both TDC and the Purchaser seeking an acknowledgment of the invalidity of both the squeeze-out
provisions in the articles of association and the authorization to delist from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and
the NYSE granted at the EGM. On April 5, TDC and the Purchaser announced that they would challenge the
DCCA’s ruling in the Danish courts. TDC has proceeded with its intention to delist its ADSs from the NYSE,
which delisting occurred on April 19, 2006. If ATP succeeds in its litigation, we will be unable to proceed with
the compulsory acquisition. In the legal proceedings instigated by ATP against the Purchaser and TDC described
above, ATP has reserved the right to challenge authorizations proposed for adoption at the annual general
meeting of TDC on April 26, 2006, as illegal, in particular authorizations (i) to issue warrants to management
and others and (ii) to repurchase shares. Furthermore, ATP claims that the reference date with regard to the
redemption price of ATP’s shares should only be decided as of when the redemption may actually be completed.
Finally, ATP claims that the Purchaser should pay interest on the redemption price. TDC and the Purchaser have
not yet responded to these claims by ATP.

**Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Our Structure**

**_Our high leverage and debt service obligations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial_**
**_condition or results of operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the notes._**

Following the Transactions, we are highly leveraged and will have significant debt service obligations. As
of December 31, 2005, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately
DKK 76,395 million (€10,240 million) of indebtedness, of which DKK 48,538 million (€6,506 million) would be
term indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and DKK 15,145 million (€2,031 million) would be
indebtedness under the notes. As a holder of our notes, our high leverage could have important consequences for
you. Our substantial leverage poses the risk that:

Š our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic and industry conditions will increase;

Š our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, business
opportunities and other corporate requirements will be limited;

Š we may have a much higher level of debt than certain of our competitors, which may put us at a
competitive disadvantage and may make it difficult for us to pursue our business strategy and to grow
our business in accordance with our strategy;

Š a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will have to be dedicated to the payment of
principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which means that this cash flow will not be available to
fund our operations, capital expenditures or other corporate purposes; and

Š our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the competitive environment
and the industry in which we operate will be limited.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, including the notes.

In addition, we may incur substantial indebtedness in the future, which could be structurally senior to the
notes or could mature prior to the notes. The terms of the Indenture and the Senior Credit Facilities and the
Bridge Facility restrict us from incurring additional indebtedness, but do not prohibit us from doing so. The
incurrence of additional indebtedness would increase the leverage-related risks described in this offering
memorandum. We may not be able to obtain sufficient financing to purchase the remaining minority
shareholding in TDC. See “—The Purchaser may not be able to obtain the funds required to purchase additional
shares and the price of any shares in a compulsory acquisition is uncertain ”


-----

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt and to fund working capital and capital
expenditures will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash. This
depends, to some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other
factors, many of which are beyond our control, as well as the other factors discussed in these “Risk Factors” and
elsewhere in this offering memorandum. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash
flows from operations or that future debt and equity financing will be available to us in an amount sufficient to
enable us to pay our debts when due, including the notes, or to fund our other liquidity needs. See “Operating and
Financial Review and Prospects” for a discussion of our cash flows and liquidity. If our future cash flows from
operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the Senior Credit Facilities) are insufficient to
pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

Š reduce or delay our business activities and capital expenditures;

Š sell assets;

Š obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

Š restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or
on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our debt, including the notes, the Senior Credit Facilities
and the Bridge Facility, limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these alternatives.

**_We are subject to significant restrictive debt covenants which limit our operating flexibility._**

The Senior Credit Facilities, the Indenture and the Bridge Facility contain covenants significantly
restricting our ability to, among other things:

Š incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

Š pay dividends or make other distributions, or repurchase or redeem our stock;

Š make investments or other restricted payments;

Š create liens;

Š enter into certain transactions with affiliates;

Š enter into agreements that restrict our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends; and

Š consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets.

These covenants could limit our ability to finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability
to pursue acquisitions, investments and other business activities that may be in our interest. We have a history of
expansion through initial minority investments, and may be unable to continue this strategy.

The Senior Credit Facilities also require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy specified
financial tests. Our ability to meet these financial ratios and tests may be affected by events beyond our control
and, as a result, we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet these ratios and tests. In the event of a default
under the Senior Credit Facilities or the Bridge Facility or certain other defaults under any other agreement, the
lenders could terminate their commitments (in the case of the Revolving Credit Facility) and declare all amounts
owed to them due and payable. In addition, a default under the Indenture would result in cross-default under the
Senior Credit Facilities and the Bridge Facility. Borrowings under other debt instruments that contain crossacceleration or cross-default provisions could also be accelerated and become due and payable in such
circumstances. We may be unable to pay these debts in such circumstances.

**_The Purchaser may not be able to obtain the funds required to purchase additional shares of TDC, and the_**
**_price of any shares in a compulsory acquisition may be uncertain._**

We do not presently have committed facilities for the purchase of additional shares of TDC other than the
remaining availability under the Bridge Facility, which expires on May 30, 2006. Following the Debt Pushdown,
the Senior Credit Facilities do not provide for any further term loans to be made available to the Purchaser (either
through equity contribution to the Purchaser by the Issuer or otherwise) for the purchase of additional shares in
TDC. The Revolving Credit Facility may not be drawn by the Issuer for this purpose. The remaining availability
under the Bridge Facility for making purchases of additional shares in TDC expires on May 30, 2006. The
shareholders of the Issuer are under no obligation to contribute further equity to the Issuer to fund purchases of


-----

Issuer.

We suspended the compulsory acquisition of minority shares following the ruling by the DCCA that it
would not register the articles of association granting the Purchaser the right to compulsorily acquire shares held
by other shareholders of TDC. The Purchaser and TDC have decided to challenge that ruling. However, no
assurance can be given that we will be successful in our challenge and the effects of a successful challenge are
uncertain. We cannot rule out the possibility that over our objection we could be required to complete the
compulsory acquisition at a higher price, as each shareholder has the right to an expert valuation of the shares
acquired pursuant to the compulsory acquisition. We believe that any such expert valuation should determine the
value of TDC Shares as of March 5, 2006, the date on which the Purchaser first initiated the compulsory
acquisition. However, there can be no assurance that the price to be paid by the Purchaser in the compulsory
acquisition would not be determined by a court or valuation expert to be greater than DKK 382 per share
(adjusted for any dividends or distributions subsequent to the initiation of the compulsory acquisition). In
addition, we cannot rule out the possibility that we could be required to complete the compulsory acquisition
even if we have not succeeded in arranging financing for additional share purchases. We do not presently have
committed financing for completing the compulsory acquisition other than the remaining availability under the
Bridge Facility. It is unlikely that any litigation with respect to the compulsory acquisition will be resolved
before such expiration of the Bridge Facility. Furthermore, there is no obligation on the part of the shareholders
of the Issuer to contribute funds to the Issuer or the Purchaser to complete the compulsory acquisition.

The Senior Credit Facilities and the Bridge Facility, as well as the covenants in the notes, restrict the
incurrence of further debt by the Issuer, which may make it more difficult to obtain additional financing. In the
event that we wished to or are required to make further purchases of TDC Shares, we could be required to
refinance our existing indebtedness or obtain consents from lenders in order to obtain the required funds, which
we may not be able to do.

**_The Issuer is a holding company that has no revenue-generating operations of its own and depends on_**
**_payments from its subsidiaries to make payments on the notes._**

The Issuer is a holding company that was formed in connection with the Transactions. The Issuer
conducts no business operations of its own and has not engaged in any activities other than the holding of
ownership interests in the Purchaser and indirectly in TDC and the borrowing of funds under the Senior Credit
Facilities and the Bridge Facility. Immediately following the issuance of the notes, the Issuer will hold no assets
and have no sources of revenue other than the ownership interests in its subsidiaries and the right to any
dividends thereon and will have to rely on payments under loans, dividends and other distributions from its
subsidiaries, as well as drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility, to fund its cash requirements, including
interest payments under the Bridge Facility and the notes and any operating expenses.

The Purchaser’s assets consist of shares in TDC. The Purchaser conducts no business operations of its
own and will have to rely on dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries to pay dividends and
distributions to the Issuer.

The Issuer only has a shareholder’s claim in the assets of its subsidiaries. This shareholder’s claim is
subordinated in right of payment to the claims that creditors of our subsidiaries have against our subsidiaries.
Holders of the notes will only be creditors of the Issuer and not of TDC or any of its subsidiaries. All the existing
and future liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries, including any claims of trade creditors and preferred
stockholders, will be effectively senior to the notes. See “Description of the Notes — Ranking.”

**_The Issuer’s subsidiaries will be subject to restrictions on making payments to the Issuer._**

The terms of the Senior Credit Facilities, the Intercreditor Agreement and applicable law restrict the
ability of our subsidiaries to make payments and other distributions to the Issuer. The Issuer is therefore subject
to all risks to which our group is subject to the extent such risks may affect the ability of its subsidiaries to make
distributions to the Issuer.

The ability of TDC to dividend or otherwise distribute funds, including by way of upstream loans, to
assist in servicing the notes and other debt will be subject to certain restrictions, including the need to have
retained earnings to distribute. As of December 31, 2005, TDC’s retained earnings on a stand-alone basis for
TDC A/S were DKK 43,967 million (€5,893 million), which amount has been reduced by the amount of the
dividend of DKK 43,481 million (€5,828 million) paid in connection with the Debt Pushdown and the
accompanying minority dividend This amount will also be reduced by the amount of any losses incurred or other


-----

capacity of TDC will be adequate to fund distributions in amounts and at times sufficient to allow the Issuer to
pay its obligations as they become due, including its obligations under the notes, the Bridge Facility and the
Revolving Credit Facility (to the extent drawn by the Issuer).

If distributable reserves are insufficient to make distributions to the Issuer, we would need to borrow
under the Revolving Credit Facility. The availability of the Revolving Credit Facility for this purpose expires in
February of 2008.

The Issuer’s subsidiaries may also be restricted from making payments to it under some circumstances
under Danish law.

These restrictions include:

Š restrictions under Danish and other applicable laws that prohibit the payment of dividends unless the
payments are made out of profits available for distribution and the payment is justifiable in
consideration of the financial position of the subsidiary (or, if the subsidiary is a parent company, the
financial position of such subsidiary and its subsidiaries);

Š restrictions under Danish law providing that dividends may only be approved (i) at the annual
ordinary general meeting of the shareholders based on the adopted annual accounts for the preceding
financial year or (ii) as an extraordinary dividend by the board of directors based on an auditorreviewed interim balance sheet and pursuant to a special authorization in the articles of association
adopted by the general meeting of shareholders; and

Š restrictions under Danish and other applicable laws that make it unlawful for a company to provide
financial assistance in connection with the acquisition of its shares or the shares of any of its holding
companies.

If our subsidiaries are unable to distribute sufficient funds to the Issuer, the Issuer may not be able to
make the required payments on the notes or the Bridge Facility when they become due. In addition, a default
under the notes or the Bridge Facility would cause certain of our subsidiaries to be in default under the Senior
Credit Facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our growth, our financial condition and results of
operations and result in our not having sufficient assets to make payments on the notes. See “Description of
Other Indebtedness.”

**_Minority shareholders may interfere with our operations and future corporate decisions._**

The Purchaser owns approximately 88.2% of TDC’s share capital, which may be reduced to 87.9%. See
“Summary Corporate and Financing Structure.” Shareholders unrelated to the Purchaser and management hold
the remainder of the outstanding TDC Shares. Minority shareholders may be able to delay or prevent the
implementation of TDC’s corporate actions, including any delisting of shares on the Copenhagen Stock
Exchange, irrespective of the size of their shareholding. Further, shareholders holding 10% of the share capital
enjoy certain privileges under the Danish Companies Act, such as, among others, blocking certain resolutions,
requesting the board of directors to convene an extraordinary general meeting and electing a co-accountant. Any
challenge by minority shareholders of the validity of a corporate action is subject to judicial resolution that may
substantially delay or hinder the implementation of such action. Such delays of, or interferences with, corporate
actions as well as related litigation may limit the access of the Issuer to TDC’s cash flows and make it difficult or
impossible for the Purchaser and TDC to take or implement corporate actions which may be desirable in view of
the operating or financial requirements of the Issuer, the Purchaser and/or TDC, including actions which may
have beneficial effects for the holders of the notes.

**Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering**

**_The enforceability of your rights under the notes may be restricted._**

The Issuer is a company organized under the laws of Denmark and the Indenture is governed by New
York law. There is no treaty between the United States and Denmark providing for the reciprocal recognition and
enforcement of judgments. The Issuer has appointed an agent to receive service of process in any action against it
in any federal court or court in the State of New York arising out of this offering. We have not given consent for
this agent to accept service of process in connection with any other claim.

All of the members of our Board of Directors and our management reside outside the United States and
the assets of most of our subsidiaries and the assets of most of our directors and managers are located outside the
United States. Service of process upon individuals or companies that are not resident in the United States may be


-----

the foreign jurisdictions where most of our directors and assets are located (including Denmark and Switzerland)
of liabilities predicated solely upon United States federal or state securities law against us, our directors,
controlling persons and management and other persons who are not residents of the United States, in original
actions or in actions for enforcements of judgments of United States courts. Under applicable Danish law, a
judgment of a state or federal court of the United States in respect of the notes or the Indenture will neither be
recognized or enforced in the courts of Denmark without a review of the merits underlying the judgment. See
“Service of Process and Enforcement of Civil Liabilities.”

**_Your ability to recover under the security and the notes is limited by subordination provisions and restrictions_**
**_on enforcement._**

The notes will be secured on a second-ranking basis by a pledge by the Issuer of 100% of the shares in the
Purchaser, shared ratably with the Bridge Facility. The shares of the Purchaser are pledged to secure obligations
under the Senior Credit Facilities on a first-priority basis. These priorities are contractually provided for in the
Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, some claims may rank by operation of law before any other claim that may
be secured by the share pledge. These claims can include, among others, court costs and costs incurred for the
preservation of the pledged assets.

You may not be able to recover on the share pledge because the lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities
will have a prior claim on all proceeds realized from any enforcement of this pledge. If the proceeds realized
from such sales of collateral exceed the amount owed under the Senior Credit Facilities and certain expenses, any
excess amount of such proceeds will be paid to the Security Agent for its own benefit and for the benefit of
owners of the notes and other creditors permitted by the Indenture to share in the collateral on an equal and
ratable basis with the notes (including the Bridge Facility). If there are no excess proceeds from sales of
collateral, or if the amount of such excess proceeds is less than the aggregate amount of the obligations under the
notes and other obligations that share in the collateral on an equal and ratable basis with the notes, you will not
recover some or all of the amounts owed to you under the notes. The ability of the holders of the notes to require
the Security Agent to take enforcement action under the share pledge is subject to significant restrictions imposed
by the Intercreditor Agreement. In particular, the Intercreditor Agreement provides for a 179-day standstill period
on enforcement of the share pledge after an event of default under the notes, and thereafter in certain
circumstances.

In the event that the Issuer or its subsidiaries incur additional debt, and the Indenture permits such debt to
be secured, then that debt may also be permitted to be secured by the same collateral as that securing the notes,
and may be ranked ahead of the security granted in favor of the notes, without the need for the consent of the
holders of the notes or the Trustee. In that event, the security in favor of the notes will be subject to restrictions
and disadvantages in favor of this additional debt similar to those outlined above in relation to the Senior Credit
Facilities. In addition, in the event that additional notes are issued under the Indenture the security in favor of the
notes will be shared among a larger principal amount of indebtedness.

In addition, the Intercreditor Agreement provides that in certain circumstances payments must be made
first to lenders under the Senior Credit Facilities and only after the claims of such lenders have been satisfied will
amounts be applied to satisfy the claims of the noteholders and the lenders under the Bridge Facility. See
“Description of Other Indebtedness—Intercreditor Agreement.”

**_The share pledge will not be granted directly to the holders of the notes._**

The share pledge that will constitute security for obligations of the Issuer will, under the notes and the
Indenture, not be granted directly to the holders of the notes but will be granted only in favor of the Security
Agent, acting as joint creditor together with the holders of the notes, of all such obligations. As a consequence,
holders of the notes will not have direct security and will not be entitled to take enforcement action in respect of
the security for the notes, except through the Security Agent, which has agreed to apply any proceeds of
enforcement on such security towards such obligations. It is uncertain under Danish law whether obligations
owing to beneficial owners of the notes that are not identified as registered holders in the share pledge will be
validly secured. The Security Agent will agree with the Trustee that the Security Agent will hold the security and
any proceeds of the security in trust for the benefit of holders of the notes and the Trustee under the notes.
However, the Security Agent has, as joint creditor together with the holders of the notes, a claim against the
Issuer for the full principal amount of the notes. Holders of the notes bear some risk associated with possible
insolvency or bankruptcy of the Security Agent. The Security Agent will agree that it will only proceed against
the security with the approval of the Trustee acting on the instructions of the holders of the notes and for the


-----

assert rights as a joint creditor for the full amount of the notes.

**_Applicable insolvency laws may affect the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer_**

In the event that any one or more of the Issuer or any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries experience financial
difficulty, it is not possible to predict with certainty in which jurisdiction or jurisdictions insolvency or similar
proceedings would be commenced, or the outcome of such proceedings. Applicable insolvency laws may affect
the enforceability of the obligations of the Issuer.

The Issuer and a number of its subsidiaries, including the Purchaser and TDC, are companies
incorporated under Danish law. Accordingly, insolvency proceedings with respect to the Issuer and its Danish
subsidiaries would likely proceed under and be governed by Danish insolvency law. Bankruptcy is the principal
form of proceeding in the Danish insolvency system. In bankruptcy, the debtor’s assets are liquidated and the
proceeds deriving from assets free from charges and encumbrances are distributed to the creditors based on a
priority of claims. A bankruptcy is often preceded by a suspension of payment. A debtor who finds itself unable
to satisfy its debts may notify the bankruptcy court of its suspension of payment of its debt. The power to
suspend payment rests exclusively with the debtor. At the time of the notification of the bankruptcy court a
suspension of payments is based on the debtor’s assessment of its ability to meet its debts as they fall due.
Subsequently, the bankruptcy court will decide if the suspension of payment may be maintained.

As a general rule, the insolvent company or any creditor may present a petition for bankruptcy. A
bankruptcy requires the bankruptcy court to be satisfied that the debtor is insolvent based on an assessment of the
debtor’s liquidity status. A bankruptcy petition by a creditor is barred if the creditor is adequately protected in the
event of the debtor’s insolvency by means of good and valid security. The Danish bankruptcy scheme is based on
the fundamental principle of pari passu satisfaction of the debtor’s creditors. The principle is, however, to some
extent modified by the rules governing priority of debts in bankruptcy. Some claims — preferential claims and
privileged claims — rank before ordinary claims and some — the deferred claims — rank below ordinary claims.
The status of a claim is dependent upon express statutory authority (except for subordinated loans). Preferential
claims primarily include costs and expenses involved in the administration of the bankruptcy estate and debts
approved by a supervisor during a suspension period. Privileged claims are mainly salary claims, including salary
income taxes (relating to salary claims being filed) (excluding salary claims from the top management). It should
be noted that almost all tax claims are not per se preferential or privileged. Interest accrued on ordinary claims
will rank as ordinary claims up to the date of the bankruptcy adjudication, after which date the accrued interest
will rank as a deferred claim.

Danish bankruptcy law contains several provisions enabling the trustee to initiate proceedings to have
certain transactions prior to the bankruptcy avoided. Most avoidance provisions contain time limits, which are
generally three months from the date of the bankruptcy petition being filed, but are in some cases up to two
years. Payments made by unusual means before they are due or in amounts that have had a distinctly impairing
effect on the debtor’s ability to pay its debts are typically subject to invalidation unless the claim of the benefited
creditor was secured in full by a good and valid security or the payment was considered ordinary. In addition, all
types of charges, mortgages and other types of security that were not granted to the creditor at the time the debt
was incurred or that were not protected against legal process without undue delay will be invalidated. A creditor
who wishes to contest a claim for invalidation may do so through the trustees, who must litigate the matter under
the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts (not the bankruptcy court) if the matter can not be solved out of court. Any
proceeds relating to a voidable claim are considered an asset of the bankruptcy estate and are to be distributed to
the creditors in accordance with the rules governing priority of debts in bankruptcy. As a general rule, such legal
proceedings must be initiated within 12 months after the pronouncement of the bankruptcy adjudication. In the
event of bankruptcy, claims in foreign currencies will be converted into Danish kroner using Danmark’s
Nationalbank official exchange rate for the relevant currency against Danish kroner as of the date of declaration
of bankruptcy by the Danish Insolvency Court.

**_The Issuer may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the notes upon a change of control._**

The Indenture contains provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of control” of the
Issuer. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the Issuer will be required to offer to repurchase all
outstanding notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any, to the date of repurchase. If a change of control were to occur, the Issuer may not
have sufficient funds available or may not be able to obtain the funds needed to pay the purchase price for all of


-----

subsidiaries’ other existing and future indebtedness may also prohibit the Issuer from being provided with the
funds necessary to purchase any notes prior to their stated maturity, including upon a change of control. Before
the Issuer can be provided with any funds to purchase any notes, we may be required to:

Š repay indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities, or, possibly, other existing and future
indebtedness that ranks senior to the notes; or

Š obtain a consent from lenders of senior indebtedness, including the lenders under the Senior Credit
Facilities, to make funds available to permit the repurchase of the notes.

A change of control of the Issuer may result in an event of default under the Senior Credit Facilities and
may cause the acceleration of other indebtedness which may be senior to the notes. In any case, third-party
financing could be required in order to provide the funds necessary for the Issuer to make the change of control
offer. We may not be able to obtain such additional financing. See “Description of the Notes — Change of
Control.”

**_The interests of our principal shareholders may be inconsistent with the interests of the holders of the notes_**
**_and of each other._**

The Consortium, a group of private equity investment funds affiliated with or advised or managed by the
Investors, indirectly owns a majority stake of our equity. As such, the Consortium will have the power to control
our affairs and policies. The interests of our principal shareholders and their respective affiliates could also
conflict with your interests, particularly if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when
due. Our principal shareholders and their respective affiliates could also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions,
divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments,
although such transactions might involve risks to you as a holder of notes. In addition, our principal shareholders
and their respective affiliates may own, acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or
indirectly with us or may own businesses with interests that conflict with ours. Our principal shareholders may
have conflicting interests with one another which may impede their ability to collectively make important
decisions regarding our business. See “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions.”

**_You may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the notes._**

The notes will be denominated in euro and US dollars. If you measure your investment returns by
reference to a currency other than euro or US dollars, respectively, an investment in the notes will entail the risk
of possible significant changes in the value of euro or US dollars, respectively, relative to the currency against
which you measure the return on your investments, caused by economic, political and other factors over which
we have no control. Depreciation of euro and US dollars against the currency by reference to which you measure
the return on your investments could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the notes below their stated
coupon rates and could result in a loss to you when the return on the notes is translated into the currency by
reference to which you measure the return on your investments. In addition, there may be tax consequences for
you as a result of any foreign exchange gains resulting from an investment in the notes.

**_Transfer of the notes will be restricted, which may adversely affect the value of the notes._**

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act or any U.S. state
securities laws and we have not undertaken to effect any exchange offer for the notes in the future. You may not
offer the notes in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable U.S. state securities laws, or pursuant to an
effective registration statement. The notes and the Indenture will contain provisions that will restrict the notes
from being offered, sold or otherwise transferred except pursuant to the exemptions available pursuant to Rule
144A and Regulation S, or other exceptions, under the U.S. Securities Act. Furthermore, we have not registered
the notes under any other country’s securities laws. It is your obligation to ensure that your offers and sales of the
notes within the United States and other countries comply with applicable securities laws. See “ Notice to
Investors.”

**_An active trading market may not develop for the notes, in which case your ability to transfer the notes will be_**
**_more limited._**

The notes are new securities for which there currently is no market. Although an application will be made
to list the notes on the Euro MTF, the alternative market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange, we cannot assure
you that the notes will become or remain listed. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of any market that may


-----

notes, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and other factors, including general economic
conditions and our own financial condition, performance and prospects, as well as recommendations of securities
analysts. The Joint Book-Running Lead Managers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the
notes. However, they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue such market-making at any time without
notice. As a result, we cannot assure you that an active trading market for the notes will develop or, if one does
develop, that it will be maintained.

The liquidity of, and trading market for, the notes may also be hurt by general declines in the market for
similar securities. Such a decline may adversely affect any liquidity and trading of the notes independent of our
financial performance and prospects.


-----

The proceeds from the issuance of the notes will be used to repay amounts outstanding under the Bridge
Facility. The following table summarizes the sources and uses of funds in connection with the Transactions,
including the Tender Offer, the Debt Tender and Redemption, the Financings and the Debt Pushdown and the
payment of fees and expenses in relation thereto. Please see “Summary—Use of Proceeds” for further

(1) Special items include significant amounts that cannot be attributed to normal operations such as large
gains and losses related to divestment of subsidiaries, special write-downs for impairment and costs for
restructuring and others. Items of a similar nature for the non-consolidated enterprises are recognized
under income from associates and net income from discontinued operations. In 2005, special items
covered only restructuring costs and amounted to DKK (968) million (€(130) million) before tax and
DKK (817) million (€(110) million) after tax, reflecting primarily the redundancy programs in the
domestic operations and costs for financial and legal advisers related to the Transactions. In 2004, special
items amounted to DKK 385 million (€52 million) before tax and DKK 741 million (€99 million) after
tax. Profit before tax on divestment of major enterprises amounted to DKK 943 million (€126 million)
before tax, reflecting primarily the disposal of Dan Net. Restructuring costs before tax amounted to
DKK (558) million (€(75) million) and related primarily to the redundancy programs in the domestic
operations. Restructuring costs after tax amounted to DKK (192) million (€(26) million), of which
DKK 199 million (€27 million) related to a change in the tax value of goodwill in Talkline.
(2) Net financial items consists of financial income, financial expense and fair value adjustments.
(3) Gross debt represents the amount of principal repayable irrespective of related transaction costs, if any
(i.e., before adjustment for any unamortized issue costs, debt discounts or premiums arising on issuance).
For purposes of the balance sheet presentation under IFRS, debt is shown net of any unamortized issue
costs, debt discounts or premiums arising on issuance.
(4) EBITDA before special items is operating income before depreciation, amortization and before special
items, as shown on our statement of income. This measure is presented as we believe that it and similar


-----

(5) EBITDA margin is EBITDA before special items divided by revenue.
(6) Capital expenditures include expenditures on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, but
excludes share acquisitions.
(7) The capex-to-revenue ratio is calculated by dividing capital expenditures, excluding share acquisitions, by
revenue. The capex-to-revenue ratio is presented as a measure of the extent to which revenue is being
spent on capital expenditures.

We have also provided an adjusted capex-to-revenue ratio, which excludes Talkline, etc. (which includes
our Talkline and easyMobile activities). Talkline etc.’s revenue was DKK 7,763 million (€1,041 million)
in 2005 (2004: DKK 7,675 million (€1,029 million)) and capital expenditure was DKK 73 million (€10
million) in 2005 (2004: DKK 112 million (€15 million)). Talkline is a reseller of telephony products and
as a result has disproportionately low capital expenditure requirements compared to our business as a
whole. You should note that certain other aspects of our non-reselling business may have low capital
expenditure requirements.

(8) Change in working capital is change in inventory, receivables, trade payables and certain other items.

(1) Net financials consists of financial income, financial expense, fair value adjustments and share of income
before tax of associated enterprises.
(2) EBITDA is operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization. This measure is presented as
we believe that it and similar measures are widely used in the global telecommunications industry as a
means of evaluating a company’s operating performance. As presented herein, EBITDA is calculated
using statement of income data derived from our financial statements prepared in accordance with Danish
GAAP, and is therefore calculated on a different basis than EBITDA before special items.
(3) EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by net revenue.
(4) Capital expenditures include expenditures on intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, but
excludes share acquisitions.
(5) The capex-to-revenue ratio is calculated by dividing capital expenditures, excluding share acquisitions, by
revenue. The capex-to-revenue ratio is presented as a measure of the extent to which revenue is being
spent on capital expenditures.
(6) Change in working capital is change in inventory, receivables, trade payables and certain other items.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information is based on the audited IFRS financial
information of TDC appearing elsewhere in this offering memorandum and the unaudited IFRS financial
information of the Issuer as combined and adjusted to illustrate the estimated pro forma effects of the
Transactions, including:

Š the Tender Offer and the initial financing thereof,

Š the Debt Pushdown, including the drawing of the Senior Credit Facilities by TDC, the repayment of
term loans incurred by the Issuer from dividends paid by TDC to the Purchaser, in turn distributed to
the Issuer, and the payment of a pro rata minority dividend to minority shareholders of TDC,

Š the redemption and refinancing of EMTNs of TDC in the debt tender offer and the repayment of
EMTNs due on April 24, 2006,

Š the offering of the notes and the application of the proceeds thereof, and

Š the payment of certain fees and expenses associated with the Transactions.

The unaudited pro forma balance sheet gives effect to the Transactions as if they had occurred on
December 31, 2005 and the unaudited pro forma statement of income gives effect to the Transactions as if they
had occurred on January 1, 2005. The unaudited pro forma financial information should be read in conjunction
with the consolidated financial statements of TDC included elsewhere herein, “The Acquisition and Related
Financings” and “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.” The unaudited pro forma financial
information is for informational purposes only and is not intended to represent or to be indicative of the
consolidated results of operations or financial position that the Issuer would have reported had the Transactions
been completed as of the dates presented, and should not be taken as representative of the Issuer’s future
consolidated results of operations or financial position.

The unaudited pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and certain assumptions that
the Issuer believes are reasonable. However, as of the date of this offering memorandum, the Issuer has not
performed the valuation studies necessary to estimate the fair values of the assets the Purchaser has acquired and
the liabilities the Purchaser has assumed and the related allocation of purchase price. Please refer to note (c) to
the unaudited pro forma balance sheet for further discussion of the purchase price allocation.

The unaudited pro forma statement of income does not reflect any one-time charges that the Issuer will
record on or following the closing of the Transactions. These one-time charges will primarily relate to historic
debt issuance costs incurred in connection with the refinancing of that debt.

While the Purchaser had offered to acquire 100% of the outstanding TDC share capital, as of the date of
this offering memorandum, the Purchaser owns approximately 88.2%, which amount may subsequently be
reduced to 87.9%. This unaudited pro forma financial information has been prepared to reflect the acquisition of
88.2% of the outstanding TDC share capital. It is also possible that the Purchaser could subsequently acquire
further shares of TDC’s share capital.

DKK 5,104 million (€684 million) to be repaid on maturity in April 2006. EMTN bonds with a
December 31, 2005 book value of DKK 9,546 million (€1,280 million) will remain outstanding
after the refinancing.

(ix) Represents the premium of the tender price over the book value of the tendered EMTN bonds.

(x) Represents estimated fees and expenses, including Consortium fees, comprised of an estimated
DKK 1,114 million (€149 million) related to the Tender Offer and an estimated DKK 2,795
million (€375 million) related to new financing. For the purposes of the pro forma presentation,
Consortium fees have been allocated 25% to estimated acquisition costs and 75% to debt issue
costs.

(xi) Represents the cash dividend payment made by TDC to minority shareholders as part of the Debt
Pushdown on April 11, 2006, in connection with the Transactions, calculated at a dividend per
share of DKK 219.50 (€29.40) on 23,077,529 minority shares assumed to be outstanding.

(xii) Represents primarily accrued interest as if the EMTN bonds were tendered on December 31,
2005. This amount does not include interest on these EMTN bonds subsequent to December 31,
2005.

(c) For the purposes of the pro forma presentation, the excess of our costs to acquire TDC over the historic
book value of TDC net assets acquired has been assumed to be goodwill. As of the date of this offering
memorandum, the Issuer has not performed the valuation studies necessary in order to accurately estimate
the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Accordingly, the excess of the purchase
price over the historical equity has been recorded as goodwill in the pro forma balance sheet. Ultimately,
a portion of the purchase price may be allocated to plant, property, and equipment or other intangible
assets with finite lives (and related minority interest), which will result in additional depreciation and
amortization expense. In addition, a step up or change to the amount of the recorded net pension asset
could arise from the purchase and result in the elimination of any deferred gains being amortized to the
profit and loss account. The Issuer does not expect the final purchase price allocation to have a significant
impact on its cash flows or EBITDA before special items. The following table reflects the adjustment to
goodwill as a result of the purchase price:

(d) The pro forma adjustments assume that the Issuer acquires 88.2% of the outstanding share capital of
TDC. This adjustment relates to the portion of the pro forma profit and loss adjustment of the Issuer that
are attributed to the 11.8% minority interest that we have assumed will remain outstanding after the
offering less dividends paid to minority shareholders on April 11, 2006 in connection with the Debt
Pushdown of DKK 5,066 million (€679 million).

**Overview**

We are the leading provider of communications solutions in Denmark, the second-largest
telecommunications provider in Switzerland, and we have a significant presence in other selected markets in
Northern and Central Europe.

**_Segment reporting_**

We report segment information in respect of our business activities and geographical markets. The
segmentation is based on the segment’s risk profile and our internal financial reporting system. See note 4 to our
consolidated financial statements.

TDC is organized as five business lines:

Š _TDC Solutions provides mainly communications services primarily in Denmark and the Nordic_
countries. Its activities include landline telephony services, convergence products (combined landline
and mobile telephony), data communications and internet services, including broadband solutions,
security and hosting services, leased lines, sale of terminals and installation. TDC Solutions’ main
activities are performed by the parent company TDC Solutions A/S, and its subsidiaries TDC Song
(pan-Nordic), HTCC (Hungary), NetDesign (Denmark) and TDC Dotcom (based in Sweden).

Š _TDC Mobile International provides mobile telecommunications services in Denmark and a number of_
other European countries. The domestic activities include the wholly-owned subsidiaries TDC Mobil
A/S and Telmore. The international activities include the wholly-owned subsidiaries Talkline, a
German MVNO, and Bité, a Baltic mobile operator in Latvia and Lithuania. TDC Mobile
International also holds a 19.6% stake in Polkomtel, operating in Poland (which we are in the process
of selling), a 15% stake in One, which operates in Austria, and an 88.9% stake in Telmore
International Holding (“Telmore International”), responsible for cooperation with easyGroup, which
launched the easyMobile concept in 2005. Talkline owns 80% of the easyMobile business in
Germany, which was also launched in 2005.

Š _TDC Switzerland is the second-largest telecommunications provider in the Swiss market. Its activities_
include mobile, landline and internet communications services.

Š _TDC Cable TV is a Danish provider of cable TV, internet access and VoIP and can therefore provide_
triple play solutions. TDC Cable TV’s activities also include those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries
Dansk Kabel TV, Connect Partner and Telelet.

Š _Other activities include primarily TDC Services, which provides services mainly for TDC’s domestic_
business lines.

We also report certain financial information for the following geographical markets: Domestic operations,
Switzerland and Other international operations.


-----

Discontinued operations consist of entities comprising separate major lines of business or geographical
areas, whose activities and cash flows for operating and accounting purposes can be clearly distinguished from
the rest of the entity, and where the entity has been disposed of or classified as held for sale, and it seems highly
probable that the disposal is expected to be effected within twelve months in accordance with a single
coordinated plan. Income (loss) after tax of discontinued operations is presented in a separate line in the
Statements of Income with restated comparative figures. Assets and accompanying liabilities are presented in
separate lines in the Balance Sheets without restate comparative figures. Cash flows from operating, investing
and financing activities of discontinued operations are presented in separate lines in the Statements of Cash Flow
with restated comparative figures.

During the period under review, discontinued operations are comprised of our former TDC Directories
business line. Assets held for sale relate to Contactel, a business line in the Czech Republic that was sold with
effect from February 2, 2006.

**Recent developments**

TDC has not published any financial information in respect of the first quarter of 2006, and its
compilation and verification of financial data in respect of such quarter is not complete. However, based on
currently available information, TDC estimates its revenue for the first quarter of 2006 to be higher than for the
first quarter of 2005 before adjustment for acquisitions and divestments of enterprises and, to a lesser extent,
after adjustments for acquisitions and divestments. TDC also estimates its EBITDA before special items for the
first quarter of 2006 to be higher than for the first quarter of 2005 before adjustment for acquisitions and
divestments of enterprises and, to a lesser extent, after adjustment for acquisitions and divestments. TDC
estimates that, as expected, revenue and EBITDA before special items declined for the TDC Switzerland segment
in the first quarter compared to the first quarter of 2005, despite the growth on a group basis. These estimates are
based on financial information that is not final and is subject to change, and therefore no investment decision
should be based on these estimates. TDC has announced that it will issue its earnings release for the first quarter
of 2006 on May 4, 2006.

**Key Factors Affecting Our Results of Operations**

**_Overview_**

We generate a majority of our revenue from fixed line services (including fixed telephony, data
communications, internet and leased lines), mobile telephony and cable television. We believe that the ability to
provide bundled services (such as mobile/fixed convergence products) will become more important in the future
and will provide us with a competitive advantage. We also expect that enterprises with the ability to deliver
services across the Nordic markets may benefit from a competitive advantage.

**_TDC Solutions_**

_Fixed telephony_

Our fixed telephony revenues from period to period are principally affected by the number of subscribers
paying a quarterly subscription fee, traffic volumes, prices and sales mix between the retail and wholesale
markets. In Denmark, we offer basic fixed telephony services based on PSTN and ISDN. The fixed telephony
services are offered on both wholesale and retail terms. The number of retail subscribers in Denmark has
declined in recent years primarily due to fixed-to-mobile substitution. This is a general trend for operators in
Europe where an increasing number of households, due to declining mobile prices, choose only to have a mobile
subscription. The decline in retail subscribers is partially offset by an increase in wholesale subscribers, although
at lower prices than for retail subscribers.

Traffic volumes have also declined steadily during the past years. This trend can also be explained by
fixed-to-mobile substitution and increased competition. Furthermore, the emergence of competitively priced
IP-VPN solutions has made it possible for business customers with several branches to establish their own
networks, based on IP-VPN, allowing them to route traffic between branches within their own network instead of
through the public telephone network. The result of this is a sharp decline in billed minutes for business
customers, which is partly offset by an increase in internet and data communication revenue.

A number of our Danish competitors, such as Cybercity and Tele2, have introduced VoIP at highly
competitive flat fee prices that include all traffic with the exception of calls to mobile. We have already launched
IP telephony on the TDC Cable TV network in 2005, and in the beginning of 2006 we launched our own VoIP
solutions based on DSL in order to compete for the customers who migrate towards a VoIP solution. While we
believe that the emergence of VoIP has not yet had a significant impact on subscriber and traffic volumes, we
expect that the migration to VoIP will result in a substantial decline in our PSTN customer base, with a
significant impact on our revenue.


-----

retail offerings of leased lines must comply with a rule of cost orientation imposed by NITA. For example, we
are required to calibrate leased-line prices once a year in order to ensure that they exactly match the
corresponding cost plus a mark-up set by NITA.

In the wholesale market, the majority of our prices are regulated. Until 2002, interconnection prices were
regulated mainly on the basis of historical cost analyses and best-practice benchmarking against corresponding
international prices. Since January 1, 2003, prices of switched interconnection traffic, interconnection capacity,
shared access and ULL (also known as raw copper) as well as related co-location have been based on the results
of the LRAIC model. The LRAIC model was updated on January 1, 2006, which resulted in lower interconnect
prices.

_Leased lines_

The revenue and profitability of our traditional leased line business area have declined in recent years,
primarily due to migration towards IP-based solutions and declining prices due to regulation. However, new
products such as Cityman, which is a high capacity wide area network solution based on fiber-optic cable
particularly suited for municipalities and large businesses that need very high capacity between locations,
provide access to business customers and partly offset this declining trend.

_Data communication and internet services_

Our data communications and internet revenue is principally impacted by the number of subscribers we
have, the mix of subscribers between broadband and narrowband, traffic, prices and mix of bandwidths.

Subscriber growth depends on a number of factors, including performance, penetration of internet
services, tariff plans and the availability of and customer demand for new services and technologies (such as
VoIP and TVoIP), general economic conditions and our ability to attract new subscribers and retain existing
ones.

Over the last two years, the market for broadband services has increased significantly and has more than
offset the decline in the demand for dial-up services. We believe that this trend will continue. Furthermore,
broadband customers tend to have higher ARPU than dial-up subscribers, which has led to significant revenue
growth. However, competition for broadband subscriptions has intensified leading to pressure on prices. In spite
of this pressure, we have managed to maintain ARPU levels by migrating customers to higher-speed bandwidths.
We believe that we must continue to migrate broadband customers towards higher bandwidth connections in
order to mitigate ongoing price pressure. The success of this strategy will depend on the continued development
of internet-based applications that require bandwidth.

In 2005, we launched our TVoIP offering under the brand TDC TV. We believe that our TVoIP offering
will benefit us in the future, not only as an additional source of revenue and profits, but also as a means to
achieve a closer relationship with customers, in order to increase customer loyalty and so make us less
susceptible to churn and price competition.

_Terminal equipment etc._

Revenue from the sale of terminal equipment is highly dependent on the business cycle, as well as
technological developments, and thus fluctuates more than revenue from the traditional telephony business. In
recent years, there has been a growing trend among business customers to integrate their data and telephony into
one IP network. This task is highly complex and requires access to highly trained personnel. The acquisitions of
NetDesign and Dotcom Solutions were motivated by our desire to secure this technology and trained personnel.

**_TDC Mobile International_**

_General_

Growth in our mobile revenue is dependent on subscriber numbers and ARPU. Subscriber numbers are
affected by churn among existing subscribers and acquisition of new customers (gross-adds). ARPU depends on
traffic volume and pricing for different services.

Subscriber growth depends on a number of factors, including pricing, quality of customer service, our
ability to provide new value-added services, the overall growth of the market, the level of competition for
obtaining new subscribers and retaining existing subscribers and general economic conditions.

We believe that a majority of the markets in which our mobile companies operate are approaching
saturation Our ability to increase our subscriber base therefore depends increasingly on our success in providing


-----

ARPU is driven primarily by traffic volume (voice as well as data), mobile termination rates and end user
tariffs.

Traffic volume growth depends on the number of subscribers we have and the growth of the average
minutes of use by each of our subscribers. This in turn depends on subscriber quality and the level of the
continued substitution of mobile services for fixed line services and our success in stimulating additional usage.
Data services utilization depends on customer demand for mobile broadband services already introduced as well
as for future services.

Tariffs are mainly driven by the competitive environment. We believe that future ARPU growth will be
primarily driven by growth in voice usage, data services and value-added services, and will be offset by declining
tariffs and interconnection rates.

We believe that future ARPU growth primarily will be positively affected by growth in usage of data
services and, possibly, growth in voice usage due to declining minute prices. The effect of declining prices
resulting from increased competition will depend on the price elasticity in the markets in which our mobile
businesses operate. The expected decrease in voice tariffs, including interconnection rates and roaming rates, will
influence ARPU negatively.

Introduction of services based on alternative technologies, such as WiMAX, services that integrate VoIP
with mobile telephony and mobile IP telephony may in the future decrease usage of traditional mobile telephony.

The level of acquisition subsidies used to acquire subscribers from our competitors and cost held to retain
existing customers may have a significant effect on our results of operation. In Denmark, regulation limits the
length of contract for the retail mobile market to 6 months. This limits the amount of subsidy for handsets that
may be recouped through a contract. We believe that this limitation makes it more difficult for new competitors
to attract and retain our existing mobile customers with handset subsidies.

_Domestic operations_

The year 2003 and, to some extent, 2004, was a period characterized by intense price competition mainly
fuelled by the internet-based self-service operator Telmore and the second major no-frills MVNO, CBB Mobil.
However, industry consolidation has reduced the pace of price reductions in 2005. In spite of price competition,
mobile revenue grew substantially in both 2004 and 2005, as increasing traffic volumes more than compensated
for the price decreases. In 2004 as well as 2005, outgoing minutes increased by approximately 20% and SMS
volumes increased at an even higher rate. The increasing volumes in minutes is attributable to an increase in
post-paid subscribers as a percentage of total subscribers and an increase in MOU per subscriber.

_Talkline etc._

Talkline has experienced a significant growth in subscribers in 2004 and 2005. However, a decline in
MOU has led to more modest growth rates in traffic volumes. The declining MOU can be explained by a higher
share of pre-paid customers and more post-paid customers with low usage.

_Bité_

The number of subscribers in Bité has more than tripled from 2003 to 2005 and minute volumes have
doubled in the same period. The slower growth in minutes can be explained by a higher share of pre-paid users,
which was partially offset by higher MOU by post-paid customers. SMS usage has increased by a factor of 9
from 198 million messages in 2003 to 1,800 million messages in 2005. During 2004 and 2005, price competition
has increased, leading to a substantial price reduction. In particular, residential post-paid has suffered from severe
price reductions, with average revenue per minute dropping from €0.18 in the first quarter of 2004 to €0.06 in the
fourth quarter of 2005. As subscriber growth is expected to flatten over time as mobile penetration rates increase,
Bité’s future revenue and profitability will be dependent upon a moderation in further price decreases.

**_TDC Switzerland_**

_General_

TDC Switzerland operates mobile and fixed line (including internet and data communications)
businesses, which are principally affected by the same factors as the domestic operations of TDC Solutions and
TDC Mobil


-----

TDC Switzerland’s number of customers and traffic volume increased steadily during 2004 and 2005.
The Swiss mobile market in the past has been characterized by stable market shares and high prices. However,
during the second half of 2005, price competition has started to intensify in part due to the entry of new MVNOs
and branded distributors such as Migros, Coop, Cablecom and Tele2. Our future results of operations will depend
on any further price decreases and our ability to compensate for price decreases by increased usage (as TDC
Mobil has been able to do in Denmark).

Prices in the Swiss mobile market have also been impacted by regulatory developments in 2005.
Prompted by a preliminary decision by the Swiss competition authority regarding its alleged abuse of market
power, Swisscom in 2005 reduced its prices for terminating mobile calls by 40% to CHF 0.20 per minute, which
reduction put heavy pressure on other Swiss mobile operators to reduce their tariffs as well. As a consequence,
we reduced our prices for terminating mobile calls on the sunrise network by 19% to CHF 0.30 per minute.

Swisscom has subsequently challenged TDC Switzerland’s level of reduction of its prices for terminating
mobile calls on the basis that such reduction was not reciprocal with Swisscom’s reduction. Swisscom has
requested that ComCom require us to reset our prices at a lower level, retroactive to January 1, 2006. If we were
required by ComCom to make such a price reduction, it would have an adverse affect on the results of operations
of TDC Switzerland.

_Fixed line_

We believe that the major difference between TDC Switzerland’s fixed line business and TDC Solutions’
domestic business is that TDC Switzerland does not own its own access network and is therefore dependent on
Swisscom to provide services to its customers. Swisscom has been very reluctant to provide access to its network
to other operators and has not been compelled to do so by regulation. As compared to the telecommunications
markets of the EU member states, deregulation has lagged in Switzerland. In particular, ULL has not been
required in the Swiss market. This has meant that the only effective option for sunrise to offer DSL has been to
resell Swisscom product offerings, at small margins. In past years, like in most other Western European markets,
a migration towards broadband from dial-up services has taken place. Due to an unfavorable cost structure, it has
not been possible to compensate from a profitability standpoint for the loss of dial-up customers by the growth in
DSL. We believe that in order to improve the situation it is necessary to obtain access on more favorable terms.
Therefore, the enactment of regulation requiring ULL or similar measures will be a key factor to future results.

The revised telecommunications law regarding access to ULL was passed in Swiss Parliament on
March 24, 2006. A 100-day referendum period expires on July 13, 2006. If there is no referendum and the
ordinances implementing the new law are finalized, the new law enters into force. Although unlikely, it is
possible that organizations opposed to the law could force a public vote, which would further delay enactments
by at least a year and could potentially result in enactment being prevented.

Our Swiss business benefits from regulations requiring Swisscom to grant other telecommunication
operators, including us, interconnection services under cost-based terms and conditions. Swisscom has
challenged the interconnection tariffs as set by ComCom in court. In the second half of 2006, the Federal
Supreme Court in Switzerland is expected to issue a final ruling on the matter.

**_TDC Cable TV_**

Our domestic cable TV business generates revenue from the delivery of TV signals and TV channels to
residential customers, including single family dwellings, and antenna co-operatives and housing associations,
broadband services (cable modem) and IP telephony.

The TV business is primarily affected by the number of homes passed by our cable network, the level of
penetration within the geographic area of our network and competition from alternative cable TV providers
(especially within the antenna co-operatives and housing association segment), providers using satellite signals
and TVoIP provided via DSL or fiber networks provided by companies such as power utilities.

The broadband business is impacted by the level of broadband penetration, its success in maintaining
ARPU based on demand for increased bandwidth, competition from DSL and fiber-based broadband and the
number of homes passed by our cable network


-----

content such as digital TV and VoD will positively affect revenue. Costs relating to procurement of TV programs
are impacted in part by the success of negotiating price reductions from the content suppliers. It is important for
our future profitability that we are able to obtain programs at competitive prices.

**_Special items_**

Our results of operations are affected by special items that we record from time to time. Special items are
significant amounts that cannot be attributed to normal operations such as large gains and losses related to
divestment of subsidiaries, special write-downs for impairment and costs for restructuring and others. Items of a
similar nature for the non-consolidated enterprises are recognized under income from associates and net income
from discontinued operations.
In 2005, special items related to restructuring costs, reflecting primarily the redundancy programs in the
domestic operations and costs for financial and legal advisers related to the Transactions. In 2004, special items
related primarily to profits on the disposal of Dan Net and restructuring costs related primarily to the redundancy
programs in the domestic operations. We expect to recognize further special items in 2006 as a result of
announced redundancy programs.

**_Restructuring and cost management programs_**

Our revenue and profitability are impacted by, among other things, the significant price competition we
face in our markets and government-imposed pricing restrictions. As a result, our continued ability to reduce
costs will be a key factor in maintaining or improving our profitability and cash flows.
We continue to focus on reducing operational expenditures. Employee-related expenses are a significant
component of our operating expenses, and the focus of our recent cost reduction programs has been on reducing
employee headcount. During the last three years we have reduced our headcount by over 2,200 employees
through early retirement and voluntary redundancy programs, and we expect to further reduce headcount in 2006
by approximately 720 employees. While these programs contribute to a reduction in operating expenses, we may
record special items associated with these programs.

**_Acquisitions and divestitures_**

We have made a number of significant acquisitions and divestitures in recent years. The most important
of these include the acquisition of Song Networks (now TDC Song) and the disposal of the TDC Directories
business line. We are also currently in the process of disposing of our minority interest in Polkomtel.
Our acquisitions and divestitures can have a number of effects on our results of operations, which may
impact the period-to-period comparability of our consolidated financial statements or the results of a business
line. Dispositions of large businesses may be characterized as discontinued operations, with restated comparative
figures being presented. Large gains and losses on the divestiture of businesses may also be recorded as special
items.
Depending on the nature of the business being sold, the margins of a business line or group may be
affected. For instance, the acquisition of TDC Song, which overall had lower margins than the existing TDC
Solutions business line, meant that margins for TDC Solutions declined slightly in the period under review,
despite improvement in the underlying business on a like-for-like basis.
For further details as to some of our material acquisitions and divestitures, please see “—Acquisitions and
divestitures.”

**_Substantial leverage and other Transactions-related effects_**

Following the Transactions, we have substantial additional indebtedness. As of and for the year ended
December 31, 2005, on a pro forma basis we would have had DKK 76,395 million (€10,240 million) of
indebtedness and cash interest expense of DKK 4,936 million (€662 million). We expect to require more cash
than in previous years to service our debt obligations, and our debt obligations may also require us to use cash
from operations or from asset disposals to pay down debt, leading to lower cash balances. Our costs for future
borrowings will likely increase to reflect our new capital structure. In addition, the Issuer may record higher
levels of depreciation and amortization than TDC has historically recorded, due to the application of purchase
accounting to the financial statements. Any positive difference between purchase price and the fair value of the
assets and liabilities will be assigned to goodwill, which will be tested for impairment. We would also expect to
incur lower levels of profit and therefore lower levels of income tax as a result of the Transactions.

**_Taxation_**

Our results of operations and cash flows are impacted by our tax rates. The ability of TDC to upstream
funds to the Issuer to service the notes is also impacted by the tax position of TDC and its subsidiaries


-----

taxation with foreign group companies. As a result we may lose access to tax losses that we were able to utilize
in the past. We have made provisions for the expected effects of this change in our consolidated financial
statements.

**Critical Accounting policies**

For more detail on the estimates and accounting policies relating to our results of operations and our
balance sheet, see the notes to our consolidated financial statements.

**Comparison of the year ended December 31, 2005 to the year ended December 31, 2004**

The following discussion of TDC’s results of operations should be read in conjunction with our
consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this offering memorandum.

**_Revenue_**

TDC’s revenue was DKK 46,588 million (€6,243 million) in 2005, increasing by DKK 4,249 million
(€569.5 million) or 10.0% compared with 2004. This growth stemmed mainly from the inclusion of acquired
companies, including changes in ownership shares, but also reflected growth in our mobile businesses in Denmark
and Germany and our domestic broadband and cable TV businesses. This positive increase was partly offset by
lower revenue from traditional landline telephony in the domestic operations caused by the migration toward
mobile telephony and private IP-based networks. Adjusted for acquired and divested enterprises, as described
herein, TDC’s revenue rose by DKK 1,847 million (€247.5 million) or 4.6% in 2005 compared with 2004.

**_Transmission costs and cost of goods sold_**

Transmission costs and cost of goods sold in TDC were DKK 17,104 million (€2,292 million) in 2005,
increasing by 9.4% or DKK 1,474 million (€197.5 million) compared with 2004, due primarily to the acquisition
of enterprises by TDC Solutions and higher transmission costs in TDC Mobile International as a result of
increased voice and SMS traffic. This was partly offset by lower costs in TDC Switzerland related to lower sales
of handsets and lower mobile termination prices. Adjusted for acquired and divested enterprises, the increase was
DKK 433 million (€58 million) or 3.1%.

**_Other external expenses_**

Other external expenses, including marketing and customer-acquisition costs as well as rent, leases and
service agreements, were DKK 9,110 million (€1,221 million) in 2005, increasing by DKK 993 million
(€133 million) or 12.2% compared with 2004. The increase occurred largely at TDC Mobile International due to
higher customer-acquisition costs in Talkline and Bité. The increase also occurred at TDC Switzerland following
the acquisition of sunrise business communications and the operation of an increased number of mobile sites at
year-end 2005. Adjusted for acquired and divested enterprises, the increase was DKK 748 million
(€100 2 million) or 9 5%


-----

Wages, salaries and pension costs were DKK 7,628 million (€1,022 million), increasing by DKK 795
million (€106.5 million) or 11.6% compared with 2004. The increase primarily reflected an increase in the
number of average full-time employee equivalents by 929 or 4.9% due mainly to the acquisition of companies in
TDC Solutions and TDC Switzerland. The increase also related to lower pension income from defined benefit
plans for employees with civil servant status in domestic operations. The increase was partly offset by lower
wages, salaries and pension costs due to fewer employees in the domestic operations. In 2005, 574 employees
retired in connection with redundancy programs. Adjusted for acquired and divested companies, wages, salaries
and pension costs increased by DKK 191 million (€25.6 million) or 2.9%.

**_Income before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items)_**

TDC’s EBITDA before special items increased by DKK 1,007 million (€134.9 million) or 8.4% to
DKK 13,003 million (€1,742.7 million) compared with 2004, reflecting primarily TDC Solutions’ EBITDA
before special items, which increased by DKK 776 million (€104 million) or 13.2% compared with 2004,
resulting mainly from acquired and divested companies. TDC Mobile International’s EBITDA before special
items increased by DKK 132 million (€17.7 million) or 4.9% compared with 2004, primarily reflecting growth in
the domestic operations. EBITDA before special items in TDC Cable TV increased by DKK 119 million (€15.9
million) or 33.9% compared with 2004 as a result of increased revenue driven by a larger customer base in both
the cable TV business and internet operations. The increase was partly offset by lower EBITDA before special
items from our Other Activities, which decreased by DKK 147 million (€19.7 million) or 23.0% compared with
2004 related primarily to lower pension income from defined benefit plans for employees with civil servant
status in the domestic operations. Adjusted for acquired and divested enterprises, TDC’s EBITDA before special
items increased by DKK 475 million (€63.7 million) or 4.0%.

**_Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses_**

Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses increased by DKK 129 million (€17.3 million) or 1.9%
compared with 2004 to DKK 6,790 million (€910 million) in 2005. This increase primarily related to acquired
companies, partly offset by write-downs of software and network equipment in 2004.

**_Operating income excluding special items_**

Operating income excluding special items increased by DKK 878 million (€117.7 million) or 16.5%
compared with 2004 to DKK 6,213 million (€832.7 million). This increase primarily reflected improved
EBITDA before special items, partly offset by increased depreciation, amortization and write-downs.

**_Special items_**

In 2005, special items included only items such as restructuring costs and were DKK (968) million
(€(130) million) before tax and DKK (817) million (€(110) million) after tax, primarily reflecting the redundancy
programs in the domestic operations and costs for financial and legal advisers related to the Transactions. This
amount includes one year’s special additional remuneration of DKK 6 million (€0.8 million) for the Board of
Directors due to the extra workload that included 16 additional board meetings prior to the Acquisition. Twice
the annual remuneration is included for the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Board, who coordinated the
process on behalf of the Board of Directors, participated in all negotiations and maintained all ongoing contact
with the Investors


-----

primarily reflecting the disposal of Dan Net. Restructuring costs before tax were DKK (558) million (€(75)
million) and related primarily to the redundancy programs in the domestic operations. Restructuring costs after
tax were DKK (192) million (€26 million), of which DKK 199 million (€27 million) related to a change in the
tax value of goodwill in Talkline.

**_Income from associates_**

Income from associates after income taxes was DKK 334 million (€45 million) in 2005 compared with
DKK 5,632 million (€755 million) in 2004, representing a decrease of DKK 5,298 million (€710 million),
reflecting primarily profit from the disposal of Belgacom in 2004.

**_Net financials_**

Net financials, including fair value adjustments, consist of financial income, financial expenses and fair
value adjustments. Net financials, including fair value adjustments, were DKK (1,056) million (€(141) million)
in 2005, compared with DKK (716) million (€(96) million) in 2004.

In 2005, fair value adjustments were DKK (184) million (€(25) million) and related mainly to negative
fair value adjustments of TDC’s holding of bonds and derivative financial instruments.

In 2004, fair value adjustments resulted in income of DKK 178 million (€24 million) primarily reflecting
a fair value adjustment of a cash receivable recognized in other fair value adjustments.

Financial income was DKK 2,454 million (€329 million) in 2005, representing a decrease of
DKK 93 million (€13 million) compared with DKK 2,547 million (€341 million) in 2004.

Financial expenses was DKK (3,326) million (€(446) million) in 2005, representing a decrease of
DKK 115 million (€15 million) compared with DKK (3,441) million (€(461) million) in 2004.

Financial expenses, net, excluding fair value adjustments, was DKK (872) million (€(117) million) in
2005, representing a decrease of DKK 22 million (€3 million) compared with 2004. This development mainly
reflected positive foreign currency adjustments, offset by higher net interest expenses, primarily due to interest
relating to tax refunds in 2004.

**_Income taxes_**

Income taxes were DKK 1,026 million (€138 million) in 2005, representing a decrease of
DKK 15 million (€2 million) or 1.4%. Income taxes related to net income, excluding special items and fair value
adjustments, were DKK 1,224 million (€164 million) in 2005, representing a decrease of DKK 136 million (€18
million) or 10% compared with 2004. The effective tax rate, excluding special items and fair value adjustments,
was 21.6% in 2005 compared with 27.2% in 2004. The decrease in the effective tax rate from 2004 to 2005 is
mainly due to the non-recurring impact from the lowering of the Danish corporate income tax from 30% to 28%
due to a reduction in deferred tax liabilities for TDC.

Income taxes relating to special items resulted in tax income of DKK 151 million (€20 million) in 2005
compared with tax income of DKK 356 million (€48 million) in 2004, a decrease of 58%.

Income taxes relating to fair value adjustments resulted in tax income of DKK 47 million (€6 million) in
2005 compared with a tax expense of DKK 37 million (€5 million) in 2004.

**_Net income from discontinued operations_**

Net income from discontinued operations increased from DKK 315 million (€42 million) in 2004 to DKK
3,953 million (€530 million) in 2005, primarily reflecting profit on the disposal of TDC Directories on
November 30, 2005.

**_Net income_**

Net income, including special items and fair value adjustments, decreased by DKK 2,460 million
(€330 million) or 24.8% compared with 2004 to DKK 7,450 million (€999 million). Net income, excluding
special items and fair value adjustments, increased by DKK 756 million (€101 million) or 19.2% compared with
2004 to DKK 4,699 million (€630 million). The increase related primarily to the improved EBIT and lower
income tax following an amendment of the Danish tax law.


-----

The consolidated balance sheets were DKK 93,524 million (€12,537 million) at year-end 2005, representing
an increase of DKK 3,260 million (€437 million) compared with 2004. The increase in total assets during 2005 was
due mainly to an increase in cash and cash equivalents following the disposal of TDC Directories.

Equity was DKK 43,795 million (€5,869 million) at year-end 2005. This represented an increase of DKK
4,945 million (€663 million) compared with year-end 2004, which increase was primarily generated by net
income of DKK 7,450 million (€999 million) in 2005. This was partly offset by dividend payments of DKK
2,440 million (€327 million) in relation to 2004.

Total liabilities were DKK 49,729 million (€6,665 million), representing a decrease of DKK 1,685 million
(€226 million) or 3.3% compared with year-end 2004, reflecting primarily lower income tax provisions.

Net interest-bearing debt was DKK 16,475 million (€2,208 million) at year-end 2005, representing a
decrease of DKK 3,671 million (€492 million) compared with 2004, due mainly to positive cash flows from
operations and the disposal of TDC Directories, partly offset by capital expenditures, an increased ownership
share in HTCC and the acquisition of Dotcom Solutions and sunrise business communications.

**TDC Solutions**

TDC Solutions offers a wide range of communications services in Denmark and the Nordic countries as
well as the Hungarian market through HTCC. Its activities include landline telephony services, convergence
products (combined landline and mobile telephony), data communications and internet services, including
broadband solutions, security and hosting services, leased lines, sale of terminals and installation.

At year-end 2005, TDC Solutions had 4.5 million customers, with 4.1 million in the domestic market
and 392,000 in international subsidiaries and 12,231 full-time employee equivalents. Revenue was
DKK 21,631 million (€2,899 million) in 2005 and EBITDA before special items was DKK 6,648 million (€891
million). At year-end 2005, TDC Solutions A/S had 8,912 employees and significant operations through a
number of companies. TDC Song (which includes companies in Denmark, Norway, Sweden and Finland), our
fully-owned pan-Nordic network operator mainly for business customers, had 797 full-time employee
equivalents at year-end 2005. HTCC, our 63.4% owned Hungarian landline and data communications provider,
had 685 full-time employee equivalents at year-end 2005. TDC Dotcom, an important provider of
telecommunications infrastructure for Swedish business customers, had 760 full-time employee equivalents at
year-end 2005. Of our fully-owned subsidiaries, NetDesign, a leading provider of IP/LAN infrastructure for
business customers, had 171 full-time employee equivalents and Contactel, our provider of internet and landline
telephony in the Czech Republic, which was divested with effect from February 2, 2006, had 264 full-time
employee equivalents at year-end 2005.

**_Business areas_**

TDC Solutions’ main business areas are described below:

_Landline telephony_

Landline telephony represents the major share of revenue in TDC Solutions and was DKK 10,453 million
(€1,401.0 million) in 2005, corresponding to 48% of TDC Solutions’ revenue compared with 52% in 2004.
Landline telephony includes retail landline telephony, including landline traffic and subscriptions, and wholesale
landline telephony, consisting primarily of domestic and international wholesale traffic as well as domestic
service provider revenue. TDC Song and HTCC generated DKK 1,597 million (€214 million) of total revenue.

The number of landline customers in TDC Solutions A/S has declined because of the migration toward
mobile telephony and IP-based technologies. To counter this development and to meet the market’s increased
focus on flat rate products, TDC Solutions A/S launched “TDC Samtale” in 2004, giving unlimited landline
minutes in off-peak hours at a flat monthly rate. This product was well received by our customers and as a
continuation of its success, TDC Solutions A/S launched “TDC Samtale Døgn” in 2005, extending the hours of
unlimited national landline minutes at a flat monthly rate day and night. TDC Solutions A/S has launched
internet-based telephony (VoIP) for residential customers in January 2006.

_Data communications and internet services_

In 2005, revenue from data communications and internet services was DKK 5,000 million (€670 million),
corresponding to 23% of TDC Solutions’ total revenue compared with 21% in 2004. The business area includes
mainly broadband solutions, private IP-based networks, dial-up solutions and data communications services.
TDC Song and HTCC generated DKK 1 171 million (€157 million) of total revenue from data communications


-----

broadband market, TDC Solutions introduced a number of campaigns and price changes in 2005, including
higher speeds at unchanged prices. TDC Solutions also doubled the DSL speed for Danish residential customers
with the launch of 8 Mbps. In 2005, TDC Solutions also launched the internet-based TDC TV (TVoIP), and
launched VoIP for residential customers in January 2006. Through TDC Song, TDC Solutions also launched
broadband solutions on the Swedish market at speeds of up to 28 Mbps in the fall of 2005.

_Terminal equipment, etc._

With revenue of DKK 3,172 million (€425 million) in 2005, terminal equipment etc. was the third-largest
contributor to TDC Solutions’ revenue, contributing 15% of revenue compared with 14% of revenue in 2004.
This business area includes sales and installation of hardware ranging from handsets to large switchboards and
service agreements. NetDesign and Dotcom Solutions generated DKK 670 million (€89 million) of the total
revenue from terminal equipment etc.

_Leased lines_

Revenue from leased lines was DKK 1,538 million (€206 million) in 2005 and was 7% of TDC Solutions’
total revenue compared with 6% in 2004. This business area includes both domestic and international leased-line
services. TDC Song and HTCC generated DKK 422 million (€56 million) of the total revenue from leased lines.

Despite increased revenue from leased lines driven by acquisitions, this business is declining due to
increased competition from IP-based networks resulting in customer migration toward IP-based solutions.

_Other services_

TDC Solutions’ remaining share of revenue, including mainly operator services such as directory
inquiries and mobile telephony, including Duét, a convergence product combining landline and mobile
telephony, was DKK 1,468 million (€197 million) or 7% of total revenue in 2005.

**_Financial highlights_**

TDC Solutions’ revenue and EBITDA before special items increased by 16.4% and 13.2%, respectively,
primarily reflecting the acquisition of new operations. Adjusted for acquired and divested companies, revenue
decreased by 0.2% mainly due to lower revenue from landline telephony and partly offset by higher revenue from
data communications and internet services. Adjusted for acquired and divested companies, EBITDA before special
items increased by 4.1% reflecting growth mainly in data communications and internet services and stringent cost
control in domestic operations. The EBITDA margin was 30.7% in 2005 compared with 31.6% in 2004. The lower
margin in 2005 is largely due to acquired companies with lower EBITDA before special items margins, including
TDC Song. The capex-to-revenue ratio decreased from 13.2% in 2004 to 12.1% in 2005 primarily reflecting
acquired companies with relatively fewer investments compared with TDC Solutions A/S.

**_Revenue_**

In 2005, TDC Solutions’ revenue was DKK 21,631 million (€2,899 million), representing an increase of
DKK 3,041 million (€408 million) or 16.4% compared with 2004, reflecting primarily the acquisition
investments in TDC Song and HTCC. Adjusted for acquired and divested companies, revenue was DKK
17,524 million (€2,349 million), representing a decrease of DKK 30 million (€4 million) or 0.2%.

Revenue from landline telephony, retail increased by DKK 606 million (€81 million) or 8.1% to DKK
8,059 million (€1,080 million) in 2005. Revenue from subscriptions increased by DKK 144 million (€19 million)
or 3.9% compared with 2004 to DKK 3,803 million (€510 million) in 2005, resulting mainly from TDC Song and
HTCC and partly offset by a decrease in the number of domestic landline customers by approximately 127,000 or
5.3% to 2.3 million at year-end 2005. However, the decline includes an increase in TDC Samtale and TDC
Samtale Døgn flat rate plans resulting in 148,000 more customers, or an increase, of 85.7%, to a total of 321,000
in 2005.

Revenue from landline traffic was DKK 4,256 million (€570 million), representing an increase of DKK
462 million (€62 million) or 12.2% compared with 2004, resulting mainly from the acquisitions of TDC Song
and HTCC and partly offset by reduced revenue from traditional landline traffic in the domestic operations due to
a decrease in traffic minutes by 0.8 billion or 9.2%. The more pronounced decrease in landline traffic compared
with the decrease in the number of landline customers demonstrates a decline in MOU, which reflects that mostly
customers with high MOU are migrating to alternative solutions.

Adjusted for acquired and divested companies, revenue from landline telephony, retail was DKK
6,795 million (€911 million), representing a decrease of DKK 332 million (€45 million) or 4.7%.

Revenue from landline telephony, wholesale increased by DKK 204 million (€27.3 million) or 9.3%
compared with 2004 to DKK 2,394 million (€321 million), resulting mainly from acquisition investments in
HTCC and TDC Song and partly offset by a fall in total domestic wholesale traffic. Adjusted for acquired and
divested companies, revenue from landline telephony, wholesale was DKK 2,061 million (€276 million),
representing a decrease of DKK 129 million (€17 million) or 5.9% compared with 2004.

Revenue from data communications and internet services increased by DKK 1,160 million (€156 million)
or 30 2% compared with 2004 to DKK 5 000 million (€670 million) in 2005 resulting mainly from acquisition


-----

Solutions’ broadband customer base rose from 549,000 in 2004 to 689,000 at year-end 2005. Adjusted for
acquired and divested companies, revenue from data communications and internet services was DKK
3,829 million (€513 million), representing an increase of DKK 346 million (€46 million) or 9.9% compared with
2004.

Revenue from terminal equipment etc. was DKK 3,172 million (€425 million), representing an increase of
DKK 594 million (€80 million) or 23% compared with 2004, primarily relating to the recognition of NetDesign and
Dotcom Solutions and partly offset by increased sales of employee PCs in TDC Solutions A/S in 2004. Adjusted for
acquired and divested companies, revenue from terminal equipment etc. was DKK 2,429 million (€326 million),
representing a decrease of DKK 50 million (€7 million) or 2% compared with 2004.

Revenue from leased lines increased by DKK 421 million (€56 million), representing an increase of
37.7% compared with 2004 to DKK 1,538 million (€206 million) in 2005. The increase is primarily related to the
recognition of HTCC and TDC Song and is partly offset by lower revenue from domestic leased lines and
servicing of companies with private data lines. Adjusted for acquired and divested companies, revenue from
leased lines was DKK 1,058 million (€142 million), representing a decrease of DKK 29 million (€4 million) or
2.7% compared with 2004.

**_Transmission costs and cost of goods sold_**

Transmission costs and cost of goods sold were DKK 6,980 million (€936 million) in 2005, representing
an increase of DKK 1,594 million (€214 million) or 29.6% compared with 2004. The increase resulted mainly
from the recognition of TDC Song, HTCC, NetDesign and Dotcom Solutions and was partly offset by lower
domestic landline traffic, balancing declining revenue from landline telephony. Adjusted for acquired and
divested companies, transmission cost and cost of goods sold were DKK 4,735 million (€635 million),
representing a decrease of DKK 121 million (€16 million) or 2.5% compared with 2004.

**_Other external expenses_**

Other external expenses increased by DKK 58 million (€8 million) or 1.5% compared with 2004 to DKK
3,824 million (€513 million) in 2005. The increase resulted primarily from the recognition of TDC Song, HTCC,
NetDesign and Dotcom Solutions, and was partly offset by stringent cost control in TDC Solutions A/S. Adjusted
for acquired and divested companies, other external expenses were DKK 3,396 million (€455 million),
representing a decrease of DKK 234 million (€31 million) or 6.4% compared with 2004.

**_Wages, salaries and pension costs_**

Wages, salaries and pension costs increased by DKK 591 million (€79 million) or 15.8% compared with
2004 to DKK 4,326 million (€580 million). The increase primarily reflected an increase of 1,041 or 9.4% in the
number of average full-time employee equivalents resulting mainly from the inclusion of TDC Song, NetDesign
and HTCC and was partly offset by the divestment of Dan Net. Wages, salaries and pension costs in TDC
Solutions A/S increased as a result of higher wages and salaries and increased consumption of resources for
network maintenance, partly offset by a decline in the number of average full-time employee equivalents of 460
to 9,310 due to redundancy programs. Adjusted for acquired and divested enterprises, wages, salaries and
pension costs increased by DKK 39 million (€5 million) or 1.1% compared with 2004 to DKK 3,533 million
(€474 million).

**_Income before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items)_**

EBITDA before special items was DKK 6,648 million (€891 million) in 2005, representing an increase of
DKK 776 million (€104 million) or 13.2% compared with 2004. The result reflects mainly acquired and divested
companies and adjusted for these, EBITDA before special items was DKK 5,979 million (€801 million),
representing an increase of DKK 237 million (€32 million) or 4.1% compared with 2004. This was due mainly to
increased growth in data communications and internet services, as well as stringent cost controls in the domestic
operations.

**_Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses_**

TDC Solutions’ depreciation, amortization and impairment losses increased by DKK 205 million (€28
million) or 5.8% compared with 2004 to DKK 3,754 million (€503 million) in 2005, primarily reflecting
acquired and divested companies and partly offset by higher write-downs of software in TDC Solutions A/S in
2004. Adjusted for acquired and divested enterprises, depreciation, amortization and impairment losses decreased
by DKK 272 million (€37 million) or 7 9% compared with 2004


-----

In 2005, EBIT increased by DKK 571 million (€77 million) or 24.6% compared with 2004 to DKK
2,894 million (€389 million) and reflected improved EBITDA before special items, partly offset by higher
depreciation.

**TDC Mobile International**

TDC Mobile International is the leading provider of mobile telecommunications services in Denmark,
provides mobile telephony services in the UK, Germany, Lithuania and Latvia, and holds minority interests in
mobile operations in Austria and Poland (which is subject to sale). Its activities include mobile voice telephony,
sale of handsets, mobile data services and sale of traffic to MVNOs in Denmark, Lithuania, Latvia and Austria.

Over the past few years, the domestic mobile sector has experienced fierce price competition, and in 2005
the prices stabilized as a result of consolidation of the mobile operators. However, as in 2004, earnings from
operations were adversely impacted as many customers chose to switch to cheaper mobile solutions with
web-based self-services.

At year-end 2005, TDC Mobile International had 2,434 full-time employee equivalents and 7.4 million
customers, with 2.2 million in domestic operations, 3.4 million in Talkline etc. and 1.7 million in Bité. Revenue
and EBITDA before special items was DKK 16,039 million (€2,150 million) and DKK 2,809 million (€377
million), respectively in 2005.

**_Business areas_**

TDC Mobile International has three main business areas: domestic operations, Talkline etc. and Bité.
TDC Mobile International also has minority ownership shares in the mobile companies, One (Austria), and
Polkomtel (Poland).

_Domestic operations_

The domestic operations primarily include TDC Mobil and Telmore. TDC Mobil’s business areas
primarily include retail activities, including mobile telephony, sale of handsets and wholesale activities. In 2005,
revenue from these areas was as follows: 47% from retail, of which 67% was derived from mobile telephony,
18% from handsets and 14% from subscriptions; 52% from wholesale; and 1% from other activities. Telmore
offers mobile telephony services as web-based self-services through TDC Mobil’s network and is the present
market leader for the online segment. The domestic mobile market is characterized by high penetration. Further
growth has been achieved by developing new services and products. In 2005, the trend toward increased use of
consumption independent flat rate pricing for SMS messages and voice traffic contributed to a declining overall
share of the wholesale and retail markets. TDC Mobil therefore launched the consumption-independent product
MaxSMS and the supplementary services “Fri SMS” and “Fri Tale” for MobilEkstra subscribers, which have
stimulated consumption. In 2005, the growth in MOU increased as a result of customers migrating from landline
to mobile telephony. SMS and MMS traffic also rose significantly due to increased customer consumption.

In the fourth quarter of 2005, TDC Mobil launched data services (mobile broadband) via the UMTS
network (3G). Following the introduction of UMTS, data transmission prices halved and resulted in data traffic
growth of 102.9%. All TDC Mobil customers with 3G mobile phones or mobile broadband cards for portable
PCs have automatic access to the mobile broadband. The UMTS launch is expected to result in growth in data
traffic and increased revenue from TDC Mobil’s content services in the years ahead. At year-end 2005, TDC
Mobil’s UMTS network covered the four largest cities in Denmark and selected business areas. Telmore also
launched UMTS services for its customers in the fourth quarter of 2005.

_Talkline etc._

Talkline etc. comprises the MVNO Talkline, its 80% stake in the easyMobile business in Germany and
the 88.9% of Telmore International that is owned by TDC Mobile International.

_Talkline. TDC Mobile International owns 100% of Talkline, a German MVNO, which itself owns 80% of_
easyMobile Germany, an MVNO operating under its own brand through T-Mobile’s network. Talkline provides
mobile telephony. Talkline also provided content services and call-by-call pre-select telephony until April 1,
2005 (Talkline’s disposal of content services and call-by-call pre-select telephony is described as the disposal of
“Talkline ID”) when these activities were divested Revenue from these two divested business areas was


-----

Talkline operates through internet-based customer services and has a strong distribution network with retail
outlets in selected areas. At year-end 2005, Talkline had increased the number of customers receiving only
electronic bills to more than 1 million, thereby realizing various cost savings. Talkline has had a strong customer
base growth resulting in increased market shares in 2005. The expanded customer base is due mainly to
Talkline’s success with its primary distribution channels in 2005, including direct telemarketing channels and
various specialist dealers.

_Telmore International. Telmore International is the parent company of the easyMobile operations in the_
UK which works closely with easyMobile in Germany. TDC Mobile International owns 88.9% of Telmore
International. In March 2005, Telmore International launched easyMobile UK, the first MVNO under the easy
brand. In the fourth quarter of 2005, easyMobile was launched in Germany and The Netherlands; the easyMobile
operation in The Netherlands was discontinued in March 2006. Telmore International has the option of using the
easy brand in a further nine European countries. The easyMobile companies provide mobile telephony following
the same concept as Telmore in Denmark using internet-based self-service.

_Bité — Bité Lithuania and Bité Latvia_

Bité is a mobile operator that is 100% owned by TDC Mobile International operating in the Latvian and
Lithuanian markets. Bité’s revenue in Lithuania is generated primarily by mobile telephony. The company also
offers a wide range of content and data services for business customers. Throughout 2005, the Lithuanian market
experienced pronounced growth, and penetration has been estimated at 151.5% at year-end 2005 compared with
98.8% at year-end 2004. In mid-September 2005, Bité launched commercial activities primarily pre-paid mobile
telephony, in Latvia, and already had 55,000 customers by year-end 2005.

**_Associates_**

_Polkomtel (Poland)_

TDC Mobile International holds a 19.6% stake in Polkomtel, a Polish mobile operator that exceeded nine
million customers at year-end 2005 and thereby maintained its one-third share of the Polish mobile market.
Polkomtel has also successfully strengthened its leading position in the post-paid market. Our stake in Polkomtel
is currently subject to sale. See “—Recent developments.”

_One (Austria)_

TDC Mobile International owns 15.0% of One, the third largest mobile operator in Austria. Mobile phone
penetration is 105.6% in Austria and the Austrians are among the highest spenders in terms of mobile
telecommunications in Europe. In 2005, One’s customer base increased by 15.0% to 1.8 million customers partly
due to the successful launch of its pre-paid concept Yesss!

Polkomtel and One are recognized in TDC’s consolidated financial statements under the equity method.

**_Financial highlights_**

In 2005, TDC Mobile International’s revenue increased, driven by increased traffic in the domestic
operations, Talkline etc. and Bité, due to a growth in customers of 8.7%, 32.6% and 85.7%, respectively. The
relatively low revenue growth of 1.1% in Talkline is related to the disposal of Talkline ID in April 2005, which
contributed revenue of DKK 1,249 million (€167 million) in 2004 compared with DKK 326 million (€44 million)
in 2005. In 2005, TDC Mobile International’s EBITDA before special items increased by DKK 132 million
(€18 million) or 4.9% compared with 2004 due primarily to increased traffic in TDC Mobil. The EBITDA
margin was 17.5%, in line with 2004.

**_Revenue_**

In 2005, TDC Mobile International’s revenue was DKK 16,039 million (€2,150 million), representing an
increase of DKK 934 million (€125 million) or 6.2% compared with 2004, resulting from increased traffic
volumes in the domestic, German and Baltic markets (Lithuania and Latvia) and partly offset by lower prices due
to fierce competition. Revenue from domestic operations increased by DKK 648 million (€87 million) or 10%
compared with 2004 to DKK 7,151 million (€958 million) in 2005. This category includes mobile traffic as well
as subscriptions and handset sales. Growth was driven by increased revenue from both TDC Mobil and Telmore.
Growth in retail revenue from domestic operations was driven mainly by a 14.5% increase in voice traffic and a
43% increase in SMS traffic, resulting from higher average consumption and an increased post-paid customer
base. The growth in consumption resulted in increased ARPU. Revenue from wholesale in TDC Mobil increased
by 13.1% in 2005, mainly due to increasing traffic from other mobile operators.

The growth in revenue from domestic operations was adversely impacted by declining average retail
prices, reflecting customer migration toward cheaper mobile solutions with self-services via the internet.
Revenue from Talkline etc. increased by DKK 88 million (€12 million) or 1.1% compared with 2004 to DKK
7,763 million (€1,040 million) in 2005, resulting from a 32.6% increase in the number of mobile customers to
3.4 million, partly offset by declining ARPU. Revenue was adversely impacted by the disposal of Talkline ID in
April 2005. Adjusted for the disposal of Talkline ID, growth was DKK 1,011 million (€136 million) or 15.7%.
Revenue in Bité was DKK 1,125 million (€151 million), representing an increase of 21.4% or DKK 198 million
(€27 million) in 2005, primarily driven by a 44.3% increase in voice traffic due to the strong 85.7% growth in the
customer base. The increased customer base primarily reflected the launch of SMS consumption-independent flat
rate pricing for the pre-paid segment. However, this increase should be seen in the context of declining retail
prices and fewer average MOU per customer.

**_Transmission costs and cost of goods sold_**

Transmission costs and cost of goods sold increased by 2.7% or DKK 215 million (€29 million)
compared with 2004 to DKK 8 094 million (€1 085 million) in 2005 Transmission costs and cost of goods sold


-----

transmission costs and cost of goods sold decreased by 5.8% or DKK 301 million (€40 million) compared with
2004 to DKK 4,853 million (€650 million) and related to the disposal of Talkline ID in April 2005. The decline
was partly offset by increased transmission costs and cost of goods sold driven by increased traffic and a larger
customer base. Transmission costs and cost of goods sold in Bité were DKK 462 million (€62 million),
representing an increase of 32% or DKK 112 million (€15 million) and driven by increased traffic.

**_Other external expenses_**

Other external expenses were DKK 4,183 million (€561 million) in 2005, up DKK 560 million (€75
million) or 15.5% compared with 2004. Other external expenses in domestic operations were DKK 1,621 million
(€217 million) in 2005, up 1.2% or DKK 20 million (€3 million) compared with 2004, primarily resulting from
increased customer-acquisition costs and partly offset by lower uncollectibles. In Talkline etc., other external
expenses increased by DKK 436 million (€58 million) or 25.5% compared with 2004 to DKK 2,144 million
(€287 million) in 2005 mainly due to increased customer-acquisition costs driven by strong growth in the
customer base and start-up costs relating to the easyMobile operations. Bité’s other external expenses were DKK
418 million (€56 million) in 2005, representing an increase of DKK 104 million (€14 million) or 33.2%
compared with 2004 as a result of increased customer-acquisition costs driven by strong growth in the customer
base and the start-up of Bité Latvia.

**_Wages, salaries and pension costs_**

Wages, salaries and pension costs were DKK 989 million (€133 million), representing an increase of
DKK 10 million (€1 million) or 1% compared with 2004, DKK 541 million (€73 million) of which was
generated by domestic operations representing an increase of DKK 15 million (€2 million) or 2.9% compared
with 2004. Wages, salaries and pension costs in Talkline etc. decreased to DKK 361 million (€48.4 million)
compared with DKK 379 million (€51 million) in 2004 mainly due to the disposal of Talkline ID and offset by
the start up of easyMobile operations. Wages, salaries and pension costs in Bité were DKK 87 million (€12
million) compared with DKK 74 million (€10 million) in 2004.

**_Income before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items)_**

TDC Mobile International’s EBITDA before special items increased by DKK 132 million (€18 million)
or 4.9% compared with 2004 to DKK 2,809 million (€377 million) resulting from increased EBITDA before
special items from domestic operations which increased by DKK 170 million (€22.8 million) or 8.4% compared
with 2004. This growth mainly reflects increased traffic in TDC Mobil. In Talkline etc., EBITDA before special
items decreased by DKK 35 million (€5 million) or 7.8% compared with 2004 primarily resulting from increased
customer-acquisition costs and start-up costs for easyMobile, as well as the disposal of Talkline ID. Bité’s
EBITDA before special items decreased by DKK 3 million (€0.4 million) or 1.6% compared with 2004 resulting
from start-up costs in Latvia, partly offset by higher earnings from traffic combined with a larger customer base
in Lithuania.

**_Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses_**

Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses in TDC Mobile International decreased by
DKK 127 million (€17 million) or 10.2% compared with 2004 to DKK 1,123 million (€151 million), primarily
driven by fewer write-downs in domestic operations in 2005.

**_Operating income (EBIT)_**

EBIT increased by DKK 259 million (€35 million) or 18.1% compared with 2004 to DKK 1,686 million
(€226 million) due to growth in EBITDA before special items and decreased depreciation, amortization and
write-downs.

**TDC Switzerland**

TDC Switzerland’s activities include mobile telephony and sales of landline and internet services. In
2005, TDC Switzerland acquired Ascom’s communications solutions unit (now called sunrise business
communications), which has considerably helped strengthen the provision of infrastructure solutions for TDC
Switzerland’s business customers. At year-end 2005, TDC Switzerland had 2.2 million customers, with
1.3 million mobile customers, 527,000 landline customers and 386,000 internet customers. Revenue and
EBITDA before special items were DKK 9,582 million (€1,284 million) and DKK 2,584 million (€346 million),
respectively, in 2005. At year-end 2005, TDC Switzerland had 2,454 full-time employee equivalents, with 254
directly related to the inclusion of sunrise business communications


-----

_Mobile telephony_
Mobile telephony represents the highest share of revenue in TDC Switzerland and was DKK
5,710 million (€765 million) in 2005 compared with DKK 5,795 million (€777 million) in 2004. Mobile
telephony represented 59.6% of total revenue compared with 59.8% in 2004. The mobile telephony business
includes subscription fees, revenue from mobile traffic and sale of handsets. The Swiss mobile telephony market
grew in 2005, and TDC Switzerland retained its position as the second-largest provider of mobile telephony in
Switzerland. In 2005, TDC Switzerland also introduced yallo, a product that enables mobile telephony following
the Telmore Concept. Initially launched as an online-only product, TDC Switzerland now sells yallo through our
direct and indirect distribution channels.

_Landline telephony_
Revenue from landline telephony was DKK 3,080 million (€413 million) in 2005, representing a decrease
of 1.8% compared with 2004. Landline telephony represented 32.1% of total revenue compared with 32.4% in
2004. Landline telephony includes retail, including pre-fix and pre-select products, as well as wholesale
activities. Network integration solutions were included in landline telephony in 2005 as a result of the acquisition
of sunrise business communications. The market for landline voice traffic in Switzerland declined in 2005,
primarily due to migration from landline to mobile telephony.

_Internet services_
In 2005, internet services contributed DKK 792 million (€106 million) of revenue, representing an
increase of 4.3% compared with 2004. Internet services represented 8.3% of revenue in TDC Switzerland,
compared with 7.8% in 2004. Internet services includes both dial-up traffic and DSL. The broadband market
grew significantly in 2005. TDC Switzerland introduced ADSL Flex, which was the first consumption-based
DSL product in Switzerland. The Swiss dial-up market continued to decline in 2005.

**_Financial highlights_**
In 2005, despite fierce competition, TDC Switzerland continued its positive financial development from
2004. Revenue decreased slightly in 2005, but the EBITDA margin increased by 1.6 percentage points to 27.0%
due to growth in EBITDA before special items of 5.2%. The higher margin reflects mainly higher profit on
mobile telephony and less revenue from sales of handsets with a low contribution margin. The capex-to-revenue
ratio grew from 12.3% in 2004 to 14.1% in 2005 especially due to higher capitalization of asset retirement
obligations and increased network investments.

Revenue from mobile telephony was DKK 5,710 million (€765 million) in 2005, representing a decrease
of DKK 85 million (€11 million) or 1.5% compared with 2004, resulting from decreases in sales of handsets and
lower call termination prices from August 1, 2005, following a general market trend initiated by Swisscom.
Revenue was further impacted by a decline in average revenue per customer, partly offset by an increase in TDC
Switzerland’s customer base of 77,000 customers or 6.5% to 1.3 million. Revenue from landline telephony
decreased by DKK 58 million (€8 million) or 1.8% compared with 2004 to DKK 3,080 million (€413 million) in
2005, mainly resulting from a smaller customer base, which decreased by 46,000 or 8.0% compared with 2004 to
527,000 due to fierce competition in the Swiss market. Lower prices also had an adverse impact on revenue, as
TDC Switzerland reduced its prices for calls from the landline to the mobile network by passing on to customers
the cost savings from lower termination prices. The decrease in revenue from landline telephony was mainly due
to a general decline in the Swiss landline market in 2005. Revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisition of
sunrise business communications and, adjusted for this, revenue decreased by 9% or DKK 281 million (€38
million) compared with 2004.

In 2005, revenue from internet services increased by DKK 33 million (€4 million) or 4.3% compared with
2004 to DKK 792 million (€106 million). This growth mainly related to 182,000 DSL customers in 2005,
representing an increase of 34,000 or 23.0% compared with 2004. The growth was partly offset by a 117,000 or
36.4% decrease in the number of dial-up customers.

**_Transmission costs and cost of goods sold_**

Transmission costs and cost of goods sold were DKK 3,507 million (€470 million) in 2005, representing
a decrease of DKK 388 million (€52 million) or 10% compared with 2004, driven primarily by lower sales of
handsets and a fall in landline telephony and transit traffic. The costs were also impacted by lower prices for
termination of mobile calls at Swisscom as of June 1, 2005. The decrease was partly offset by the acquisition of
sunrise business communications and, adjusted for this, transmission costs and cost of goods sold decreased by
12.7% or DKK 496 million (€67 million) compared with 2004.

**_Other external expenses_**

Other external expenses were DKK 2,211 million (€296 million) in 2005, representing an increase of
4.5% from DKK 2,115 million (€284 million) in 2004, resulting primarily from the acquisition of sunrise
business communications and further costs related to an increased number of mobile sites at year-end 2005
compared with 2004. Other external expenses also increased due to increased costs for retaining customers when
a considerable number of subscriptions expired in 2005 and higher costs after moving to a new office building.
Adjusted for the acquisition of sunrise business communications, other external expenses increased by 2.8% or
DKK 60 million (€8 million) compared with 2004.

**_Wages, salaries and pension costs_**

Wages, salaries and pension costs were DKK 1,281 million (€172 million), representing an increase of
DKK 56 million (€8 million) or 4.6% compared with 2004, reflecting the acquisition of sunrise business
communications. The increase was partly offset by a decline in the average number of fulltime employee
equivalents in the remaining operations resulting from the continued focus on improved efficiency, for example
in call centers. Adjusted for the acquisition, wages, salaries and pension costs decreased by 2.2% or
DKK 27 million (€4 million), and the number of full-time employee equivalents decreased by 112 or 4.7%.

**_Income before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items)_**

EBITDA before special items increased by DKK 127 million (€17 million) or 5.2% compared with 2004
to DKK 2,584 million (€346 million) in 2005, reflecting primarily higher earnings from mobile telephony
resulting from a larger customer base.

**_Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses_**

Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses increased by DKK 123 million (€17 million) or 8.7%
compared with 2004 to DKK 1,540 million (€206 million) in 2005, reflecting increased investments in continued
mobile network expansion, including UMTS, the IT infrastructure and leasehold improvements in new offices,
sunrise Towers.

**_Operating income (EBIT)_**

EBIT increased by DKK 4 million (€0.5 million) or 0.4% compared with 2004 to DKK 1,044 million
(€140 million) as a result of the improved EBITDA before special items, but was offset by higher depreciations
and write-downs

TDC Cable TV installs and operates cable TV networks, most with internet access, which provide TV
signals for approximately 40% of Danish households. TDC Cable TV continued its high growth in customer
numbers, revenue and earnings of recent years. At year-end 2005, the number of cable TV customers was
1 million, an increase of 4.8%, and the number of customers with internet access increased by 34.9% to 251,000.
In 2005, revenue was DKK 2,107 million (€282 million), and EBITDA before special items was DKK
470 million (€63 million), representing growth of 19.3% and 33.9%, respectively.

**_Business areas_**

TDC Cable TV’s core business area is analog TV, offered in three standard packages (basic, medium and
full-range) both to individual customers and antenna and housing associations. In 2006, TDC Cable TV plans to
focus more on customer migration from analog to digital TV. 4.0% of our analog TV customers have already used
Selector to supplement their packages with digital channels from TDC Cable TV. Selector is the current means of
delivery of digital services from TDC Cable TV’s network. To receive digital services, customers must have a
digital receiver, called a Selector box, and a Selector subscription. The share of internet activities is expected to
continue to grow in TDC Cable TV’s future business. In 2005, TDC Cable TV and its subsidiary Dansk Kabel TV
launched a new IP telephony product, VoIP, which allows telephony over the cable TV network. With the
introduction of IP telephony in 2005, TDC Cable TV can now offer its customers triple play solutions containing
TV, internet and telephony. In July 2005, TDC Cable TV acquired the company Telelet, which, as part of the
subsidiary Connect Partner, provides triple play solutions to counter the competition in the housing association
market.

**_Financial highlights_**

TDC Cable TV’s revenue was DKK 2,107 million (€282 million), representing an increase of DKK
341 million (€46 million) or 19.3% compared with 2004, resulting primarily from a larger customer base. TDC
Cable TV’s EBITDA before special items increased by DKK 119 million (€16 million) or 33.9% compared with
2004 to DKK 470 million (€63 million) mainly due to increased revenue. The EBITDA margin was 22.3% in
2005 compared with 19.9% in 2004. The increase was due mainly to the large intake of customers, which does
not affect transmission costs and cost of goods sold at the same pace as revenue. The capex-to-revenue ratio was
11.0% compared with 12.6% in 2004, primarily reflecting higher revenue in 2005.

TDC Cable TV’s revenue increased by DKK 341 million (€46 million) or 19.3% compared with 2004 to
DKK 2,107 million (€282 million) in 2005. Revenue primarily includes cable TV subscription and connection
fees as well as revenue from cable modems. The increase resulted largely from an increase in the cable TV and
cable-modem customer bases in 2005, as well as higher average revenue per customer. The rise in the number of
cable-modem customers reflects a continuously increasing market for broadband services.

**_Transmission costs and cost of goods sold_**

Transmission costs and cost of goods sold were DKK 912 million (€122 million) in 2005, representing an
increase of DKK 74 million (€10 million) or 8.8% compared with 2004, resulting from increased program
expenses due to the larger customer base.

**_Other external expenses_**

Other external expenses were DKK 380 million (€51 million) in 2005, representing an increase of DKK
78 million (€11 million) or 25.8% compared with 2004, driven mainly by increased business.

**_Wages, salaries and pension costs_**

Wages, salaries and pension costs increased by DKK 67 million (€9 million) or 23.8% compared with
2004 to DKK 348 million (€47 million), due largely to an increase in the average number of full-time employee
equivalents by 158 or 19.5% to 971 at year-end 2005. The increase primarily related to customer service and
Connect Partner, which was recognized from spring 2004.

**_Income before depreciation, amortization and special items (EBITDA before special items)_**

TDC Cable TV’s EBITDA before special items was DKK 470 million (€63 million) in 2005, representing
an increase of DKK 119 million (€16 million) or 33.9% compared with 2004, mainly as a result of increased
revenue.

**_Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses_**

TDC Cable TV’s depreciation, amortization and impairment losses were DKK 245 million (€33 million)
in 2005, representing an increase of DKK 24 million (€3 million) or 10.9% compared with 2004, mainly
resulting from write-downs of network equipment in 2005.

**_Operating income (EBIT)_**

EBIT increased by DKK 95 million (€13 million) to DKK 225 million (€30 million) in 2005, mainly due
to the higher EBITDA before special items.

**Other Activities**

Other activities cover TDC Services, TDC A/S and elimination of transactions between the TDC Group’s
business lines. TDC Services supplies a number of business services for the TDC Group’s domestic business
lines, which gain economies of scale and cost-effective solutions in billing, procurement, logistics, facility
management, IT, accounting, risk management and security. TDC A/S is the parent company of our business
lines and undertakes Group functions including treasury, legal affairs, human resources, marketing and
communications.

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**

**_Historical Cash Flows_**

TDC’s historical liquidity needs have arisen primarily from the need to finance capital expenditures for
the maintenance and expansion of its operations, both in terms of new technologies and maintaining the quality
of its service, and for working capital. TDC’s principal source of funds has been cash flow from operating
activities

Cash flow from operating activities was DKK 8,691 million (€1,165 million) in 2005, representing a
decrease of DKK 2,393 million (€321 million) compared with 2004. This decrease related primarily to increased
tax payments and an adverse development of working capital in 2005 of DKK (527) million (€(75) million)
compared with a favorable development in 2004. This was partly offset by improved EBITDA.
Cash flow from investing activities was DKK (1,226) million (€(163) million) in 2005 compared with
DKK 2,889 million (€387 million) in 2004, due primarily to investments in non-current assets, an increased
ownership share in HTCC and acquisitions of Dotcom Solutions, sunrise business communications and Telelet,
partly offset by the disposal of TDC Directories. Investing activities in 2004 related mainly to dividends received
in connection with the divestment of Belgacom, partly offset by the acquisitions of TDC Song, NetDesign and
the remaining 80% stake in Telmore.
Cash flow from financing activities was DKK (4,229) million (€(567) million) in 2005 compared with
DKK (12,573) million (€(1,685) million) in 2004. The development related mainly to repayment of long-term
debt and the repurchase of shares from SBC in 2004, which were held as treasury shares and cancelled in June
2005.
TDC’s cash and cash equivalents increased from DKK 6,827 million (€917 million) as of January 1, 2005
to DKK 10,063 million as of December 31, 2005.

**Working Capital**
The following table, which is derived from our statement of cash flows, sets forth movements in working
capital for the periods indicated:

The change in working capital was DKK (527) million (€(71) million) in 2005 compared with DKK
1,212 million (€162 million) in 2004.
The adverse development in 2005 was impacted by a negative change in receivables of DKK (214)
million (€(29) million). This negative change was mainly caused by higher business sales by TDC Mobil A/S as
well as higher roaming receivables deriving from settlement of roaming charges.
The positive development in 2004 was caused by various factors impacting receivables positively,
including lower activity as well as improved receivables management in TDC Solutions A/S, lower debtor days
in Talkline, and a positive impact in TDC Mobil A/S from improved collection of roaming settlements. Also,
TDC Switzerland had lower receivables in 2004 as a result of, among other things, early payments from
Swisscom. Further, 2004 was positively impacted by payment of outstanding dividends related to Belgacom.
We continuously focus on measures to improve our working capital management.

**_Future Liquidity_**
_Capital Resources_
Our principal source of liquidity in the future will continue to be our operating cash flows. Our ability to
generate cash from our operations depends on our future operating performance which is in turn dependent, to
some extent, on general economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many
of which are beyond our control, as well as other factors, discussed in the section entitled “Risk Factors.”
In addition to cash flow from operating activities, under our Senior Credit Facilities, we have a committed
Revolving Credit Facility of up to €700 million to service our working capital needs. The availability of this
facility is dependent upon certain conditions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness — Senior Credit
Facilities.”


-----

assurance that the dividend and distribution capacity of TDC will be adequate for such needs. The terms of the
Senior Credit Facilities, our other outstanding debt and the Indenture contain a number of significant covenants
that restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things, pay dividends or make other
distributions, make capital expenditures and incur additional debt and grant guarantees. See “Risk Factors —
Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Our Structure,” “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Description of
the Notes.”

The ability of TDC to pay dividends or otherwise distribute funds, including by way of upstream loans,
will be subject to certain restrictions, including the existence of distributable reserves required under Danish
corporate law in order to make such distributions. Furthermore, any dividends or other distributions will be
required to be paid on a pro rata basis to minority shareholders. There can be no assurance that the Purchaser’s
share of these distributions, if any, will be in amounts and at times sufficient to allow the Purchaser and the
Issuer to pay these obligations as they become due. If distributable reserves are insufficient to make distributions
to the Issuer, the Issuer would need to borrow under the Revolving Credit Facility, which is available until
January 30, 2008 in order to obtain the funds needed to service the notes and the Bridge Facility (if further
drawn).

The Issuer believes that our operating cash flows, together with borrowings under the Senior Credit
Facilities, will be sufficient to fund our working capital requirements, anticipated capital expenditures and debt
service requirements as they become due for the foreseeable future, although we cannot assure you that this will
be the case. In particular, future drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility will only be available if, among
other things, we meet the financial covenants included in the Senior Credit Facilities.

As well as the working capital, capital expenditure and other requirements of our business and the debt
service requirements associated with our financing, the Purchaser may also require more funds in future to fund
the purchase of additional shares of TDC. These funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all, meaning
that the Purchaser would be unable to purchase such shares. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our
Indebtedness and Our Structure—The Purchaser may not be able to obtain the funds required to purchase further
shares, and the price of any shares in a compulsory acquisition may be uncertain.”

If our future cash flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the
Revolving Credit Facility under the Senior Credit Facilities) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature
or to fund our liquidity needs, we may be forced to:

Š reduce or delay our business activities, capital expenditures and research and development;

Š sell assets;

Š obtain additional debt or equity capital; or

Š restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, including the notes, on or before maturity.

We cannot assure you that we would be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on a timely basis or
on satisfactory terms, if at all. In addition, the terms of our existing debt, including the notes, the Bridge Facility
and the Senior Credit Facilities, limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these
alternatives.

Following the Transactions, we are highly leveraged and have significant debt service obligations. As of
December 31, 2005, after giving pro forma effect to the Transactions, we would have had approximately DKK
76,395 million (€10,240 million) of indebtedness, of which DKK 48,538 million (€6,506 million) would have
been outstanding indebtedness under the Senior Credit Facilities and DKK 15,145 million (€2,031 million)
would have been indebtedness under the notes. We also would have €700 million available under the Revolving
Credit Facility and €269 million available under the Bridge Facility until May 30, 2006. We anticipate that our
high leverage will continue for the foreseeable future. Our high level of debt may have important negative
consequences for you. For more information, please see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Our high leverage
and debt service obligations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of
operations and preclude us from satisfying our obligations under the notes.”

Our debt financing constrains our ability to utilize cash, including cash generated from asset disposals,
and may require us to use this cash to pay down debt rather than invest in our business.

One of the key components of our strategy is to reduce our debt levels going forward. We will evaluate
the future potential of each of our assets with a view to either dispose of them at a profit, or to build upon our


-----

will be successful in our efforts to dispose of assets in the future or to reduce our debt levels.

**_Financing Arrangements_**

Our Senior Credit Facilities consist of Term Facilities and a Revolving Credit Facility of up to €700
million.

The Senior Credit Facilities contains financial covenants relating to:

Š maintenance of a minimum ratio of Consolidated Cashflow to Net Debt Service;

Š maintenance of a minimum ratio of Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Net Finance Charges for
specified annual periods ending quarterly;

Š maintenance of a maximum ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt on specified dates to Consolidated
EBITDA, for specified annual periods ending quarterly; and

Š limitation on our annual aggregate Capital Expenditure

(in each case, as such terms are defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement).

The calculation of EBITDA under our Senior Credit Facilities is different from the calculation of EBITDA
before special items presented in this offering memorandum. For more information, see “Description of Other
Indebtedness — Senior Credit Facilities.”

Our Senior Credit Facilities also contain customary affirmative and negative covenants, including
restrictions on additional indebtedness, dividend payments, intercompany and other loans and investments,
capital expenditures, asset sales, liens and pledges, transactions with affiliates and amendments to charter
documents and material agreements. Our Senior Credit Facilities also contain certain customary events of
default. Please see the section entitled “Description of Other Indebtedness — Senior Credit Facilities.”

In addition, the Bridge Facility contains covenants that are substantially similar to the covenants
contained in the Senior Credit Facilities. We anticipate that the covenants in the Bridge Facility will be amended
after the issuance of the notes to become substantially similar to those included in the notes. The availability of
further amounts under the Bridge Facility expires on May 30, 2006.

**Acquisitions and divestitures**

Since January 1, 2004, we have made numerous acquisitions and divestitures.

In 2004, our significant acquisitions and divestitures included the acquisition in January of the remaining
80% of Telmore for DKK 0.3 billion (€0.04 billion), the sale in March of our 16.5% stake in Belgacom as part of
the Belgacom IPO for a share of the proceeds totalling DKK 11.8 billion (€1.6 billion), the divestment in August
2004 of Dan Net, an international clearing house for fixed and mobile traffic, for DKK 1.2 billion (€0.2 billion),
the acquisition of Song Networks (now TDC Song), a pan-Nordic network operator, for DKK 4.6 billion (€0.6
billion), of which TDC owned 99.4% by the end of 2004, and the acquisition in December of NetDesign, a
company specializing in IP communications solutions for the business market, for DKK 0.3 billion (€0.04
billion).

In 2005, our significant acquisitions and divestitures included the increase of our stake in HTCC, for
DKK 456 million (€61 million), of which TDC held 63.4% by the end of 2005, the acquisition in June of Dotcom
Solutions, a Swedish provider of LAN infrastructure for business customers for DKK 242 million (€32.4 million)
on a cash-free and debt-free basis, the acquisition in July of Ascom Business Communication Switzerland (now
sunrise business communications), a Swiss LAN infrastructure provider, for DKK 161 million (€22 million), and
the divestment in November of TDC Directories, a traditional and electronic and web-based directory businesses
in Denmark, Sweden and Finland, for DKK 4.9 billion (€0.7 billion).

**Capital expenditures**

Excluding share acquisitions by TDC, TDC’s capital expenditures were DKK 5,624 million (€754
million) in 2005, corresponding to 12.1% of revenue. In 2006, we expect capital expenditures, excluding share
acquisitions, to be broadly in line with 2005. We expect to make higher capital expenditures in 2006 for UMTS,
fiber solutions and internet access, but also expect to record lower capital expenditures for GSM as well as
general savings. Following the Acquisition, our existing plans for capital expenditures may be reviewed or
modified


-----

decrease related mainly to the acquisition of TDC Song and NetDesign in 2004, which totaled DKK
4,564 million (€612 million), and was partly offset by the impact of the acquisitions of HTCC, Dotcom Solutions
and sunrise business communications in 2005 totaling DKK 625 million (€84 million).

Capital expenditures, excluding share acquisitions, rose DKK 476 million (€64 million) or 9.2% to DKK
5,624 million (€754 million) in 2005 compared with 2004. The increase stemmed mainly from increased capital
expenditure by TDC Mobile International, which increased DKK 233 million (€31 million) due primarily to the
expansion of the UMTS network and capital expenditures in relation to Bité. Capital expenditures in TDC
Solutions rose DKK 177 million (€24 million) due mainly to capital expenditures in the acquired companies. The
capex-to-revenue ratio was 12.1% in 2005 compared with 12.2% in 2004.

1 Includes TDC A/S, TDC Services and eliminations.

TDC Solutions’ capital expenditures increased by DKK 177 million (€24 million) to DKK 2,624 million
(€352 million) in 2005 resulting mainly from capital expenditures by the acquired companies TDC Song and
HTCC. Capital expenditures in domestic operations decreased due to, among other factors, lower unit costs for
DSL equipment. Adjusted for acquired enterprises, capital expenditures decreased by DKK 175 million (€24
million), or 7.5%, compared with 2004.

TDC Mobile International’s capital expenditures increased by DKK 233 million (€31 million) or 22.8%
compared with 2004 to DKK 1,256 million (€168 million) in 2005. Capital expenditures relating to domestic
operations were DKK 831 million (€111 million), representing an increase of DKK 84 million (€11 million) or
11.2% compared with 2004. The increase mainly resulted from the expansion of the UMTS network. The
remaining growth mainly resulted from the expansion of the GSM network of Bité Lithuania, the license fee in
Latvia and the roll out of GSM and UMTS networks of Bité Latvia.

TDC Switzerland’s capital expenditures were DKK 1,352 million (€181 million) in 2005, representing an
increase of DKK 156 million (€21 million) or 13.0% compared with 2004, due primarily to the upgrading of the
GSM network with EDGE network technology and higher capitalization of asset retirement obligations (non-cash
items).

TDC Cable TV’s capital expenditures increased by DKK 8 million (€1 million) compared with 2004 to
DKK 231 million (€31 million) and mainly reflected higher investments in network expansion, TVoIP and VoD
in 2005, partly offset by lower expenses for return path upgrades after a large part of the roll out of the cable
network was completed.

statements which describes certain contingent liabilities


-----

At December 31, 2005, approximately 3,850 of our employees were entitled to a pension from the three
pension funds related to TDC under conditions similar to those provided by the Danish Civil Servants’ Pension
Plan. In addition, 7,750 members of the pension funds receive or are entitled to receive pension benefits. Since
1990, no new members have joined the pension fund plans, and the pension funds are prevented from admitting
new members in the future due to their bylaws. In accordance with existing legislation, bylaws and pension
regulations, TDC is required to make contributions to meet the premium reserve requirements. Our pension funds
invest in a variety of marketable securities, including equities. The rate of return on these investments has
implications for our financial results and pension plan funding requirements. TDC is obliged to cover any
shortfall in these pension funds’ ability to comply with the premium reserve requirements under the Danish Act
on Company Pension Funds.

We also operate defined benefit plans that cover employees of certain of our non-Danish companies.

As of December 31, 2005, for accounting purposes only, our balance sheet shows a net positive pension
asset related to our Danish defined benefit plans (see note 29 to our consolidated financial statements). Reference
is made to the above description of the obligations of TDC to make contributions to meet the premium reserve
requirements of the pension funds.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk**

We are exposed to certain market and credit risks related to our financial portfolios, investments in
foreign companies, and purchases and sales of goods and services denominated in foreign currencies. We
identify, monitor and control each of these risks through policies and procedures approved by our management.
The market values of financial assets and liabilities and interest-rate, exchange-rate, credit and share-price
exposures are computed on a daily basis. The Board of Directors defines the highest acceptable levels of
exposure. An updated financial strategy with defined levels of acceptable exposure is to be outlined and approved
by the new board when the final capital structure is in place. Our methodology for interpreting exposure to risk
and management of these risks is set forth below.

For a discussion of our historical exposures as of December 31, 2005, please see note 28 to our
consolidated financial statements.

**_Liquidity risk_**

We are exposed to short-term liquidity risk only to a small degree as we place cash resources exclusively
in highly marketable securities. Please see also “— Liquidity and Capital Resources — Future Liquidity.”

**_Interest rates_**

Interest-rate risk management involves surveillance of our interest-bearing assets, liabilities and financial
instruments. The interest-rate risk is calculated according to the value-at-risk model and is managed using
interest-rate swaps.

Under the Senior Credit Facilities, from 90 days after the date of the initial funding we are obligated to
provide hedging protection for 50% of all principal amounts at any time outstanding under the Term Facilities to
be protected from interest-rate risks at a fixed rate for a period of at least three years from the initial funding date.

**_Exchange rate_**

Presently, the net exchange-rate exposure in domestic companies from trade payables and receivables is
hedged on the date on which it is known. The exchange-rate exposure from our business activities relates
materially to the net income in foreign subsidiaries, as their income and expenses are denominated mainly in
local currencies. Currency swaps and forward-exchange contracts are used to minimize exposure from financial
activities in foreign currencies. However, we do not consider positions in euro to constitute a major risk because
of the fixed exchange-rate policy of the Danish government in terms of the euro. As a general rule, we do not
hedge investments in foreign enterprises but have in the past decided to hedge our investment in TDC
Switzerland. Currency gains/losses resulting from this activity are reflected in currency translation adjustments
under equity. Going forward, we intend to put in place hedging in relation to our U.S. dollar denominated notes.

**_Value at risk_**

Market risk is the risk of fluctuations in the market value of a financial instrument as a result of changes
in market factors Statistical models based on fluctuations in historical prices can estimate potential losses that


-----

significant financial instruments based on volatilities of and correlations between exchange rates and interest
rates respectively. The VaR calculations are based on the portfolios held and express how adverse changes in
market prices affect the market value of our financial instruments. The daily estimates represent the maximum
potential financial loss to us, at a 95% confidence level, from adverse changes in either interest rates or foreign
exchange rates over a one-year period. The intention of our financial strategy is to establish approved maximum
amounts for interest-rate and currency exposures that are acceptable compared with our expected future earnings,
equity and market capitalization.

**_Credit risks_**

We are exposed to credit risks in a variety of areas: as a supplier of services to Danish and international
customers and business partners, as a counterparty to financial contracts, and as a holder of securities. Credit
risks associated with our financial contracts are managed by a set of policies and procedures stating approved
maximum credit limits based on credit ratings of counterparties, for example.

**Danish Fixed Line Market**

The Danish fixed line market is a mature market characterized by high penetration rates for telephony and
broadband usage, well-developed competition, an advanced regulatory environment and a high degree of
consumer choice. We are the market leader across all major segments of the Danish fixed line market, and
according to NITA, we had 81% market share of all fixed lines, 64% of fixed line traffic, 72% retail market share
of DSL based on the number of subscribers and 58% of all broadband customers in Denmark as of December 31,
2005.

**_Traditional Telephony_**

The Danish fixed line telephony market as at the end of 2005 had 3.4 million subscriber lines, split
between 2.5 million traditional analog telephone lines and 0.9 million ISDN lines. The total number of subscriber
lines in the Danish market declined from 3.9 million to 3.4 million between 2001 and 2005, driven mainly by
fixed-to-mobile substitution and, to a lesser extent, migration from traditional telephony to VoIP services. In the
corporate sector, the number of traditional subscriber lines has also declined due to increased use of IP-VPN
solutions We expect this trend to continue over the coming years particularly through the migration to IP-based

corporate data markets.

From a regulatory perspective, the Danish fixed line telephony market is advanced, with CPS introduced
in the late 1990s, ULL introduced in 1998 and full number portability in 2001. Regulated interconnection prices
in the Danish market have consistently been low by international comparison and have created an opportunity for
many alternative providers to compete with us. The price declines generated from the intense competition in the
late 1990s through to 2002 have tapered off in recent years and tariff pricing for the main fixed line players in the
market has remained broadly stable or has increased since 2002. However, the effective per-minute costs to end
users have continued to fall due to the increased use of discounting and flat rate pricing models in the market.

Our principal competitors in the Danish fixed line telephony market are Tele2, Telia and Sonofon with
13%, 8% and 4% market share, respectively, as measured by fixed line voice traffic. Tele2, Telia and Sonofon
are also the largest resellers of subscriber lines in Denmark with 34%, 25% and 11% market share, respectively
(not including ourselves), of all fixed subscriber lines offered by competitors to TDC. The remaining part of the
Danish fixed line telephony market is fragmented with a large number of operators competing mainly on the
basis of wholesale line rental, CPS, call-by-call and VoIP services, and includes operators such as ACN,
Cybercity, DLG, IDT, MCI and Universal Telecom.

**_Broadband_**

In comparison with other European countries, Denmark has a high availability of broadband
infrastructure and a widespread use of broadband connections by both residential and business customers. In
October 2005, NITA published a study on the broadband sector indicating that broadband access via DSL is
available to 98% of all Danish households and businesses, whereas broadband access via upgraded cable TV
networks is available to 60% of all Danish households. As of December 31, 2005, there were 1.35 million
broadband subscribers in Denmark, representing approximately 54% of all Danish households. At the same time,
the total number of internet subscribers in Denmark, including dial-up users, stood at 1.8 million, representing
approximately 72% of all Danish households. The Danish broadband market has displayed considerable growth
in recent years, with the total number of subscriptions increasing from 0.4 million at the end of 2002 to
1.35 million at December 31, 2005, representing a CAGR of 44%. DSL is the most common access technology
with 0.8 million subscribers, followed by cable modem technology with 0.4 million subscribers. The remaining
part of the market, approximately 132,000 subscribers, access broadband through FTTH, LAN or wireless
solutions.

We are the largest DSL provider with 72% market share of all DSL connections in Denmark as at
December 31, 2005. Our principal competitors in the DSL market include Cybercity, a subsidiary of Telenor, and
Tele2. As at December 31, 2005, Cybercity and Tele2 had market shares of 15% and 9%, respectively. We are
also the largest provider of broadband connections over cable TV networks in the Danish market with a 54%
market share. The other main providers of cable broadband services in Denmark include Telia Stofa, with 32%
market share and A+ Arrownet, with 7% market share.

From a regulatory perspective, the Danish broadband market is advanced compared to other European
countries, with competitors of TDC being able to offer DSL services on the basis of several different business
models, including ULL on either a full or shared basis, bitstream access and resale. Furthermore, Naked
Bitstream Access was introduced in the beginning of 2006, allowing our competitors to offer DSL lines without
an ordinary telephone line subscription, however at a cost equal to the full unbundling fee. Of all DSL
subscriptions in the Danish market provided by our competitors, as of December 31, 2005, 58% were offered on
the basis of ULL, 35% through bitstream access and 7% on the basis of a resale arrangement.

We believe that competition in the broadband market will increase in the future. We believe that various
Danish utility companies have plans to invest more than DKK 9.5 billion (€1.3 billion) to pass up to 950,000
homes with FTTH technology by 2012. We believe that we are well-equipped to meet this potential competition
through our ongoing investments in regional fiber rings and upgrades to our DSL platform in local exchanges,
allowing us to offer broadband capacity comparable to the capabilities of FTTH networks. Furthermore, we
believe we enjoy a cost and time-to-market advantage relative to these new networks. FTTH technology requires
building new local access networks and is therefore a more expensive solution than DSL or cable broadband
technology, which makes use of existing local access networks.


-----

There are four licensed MNOs in Denmark serving 5.5 million subscribers as at the end of 2005,
representing a penetration rate of 101%, of the Danish population. Given the current level of penetration, we
expect the growth in the number of customers to slow down in the future as the focus of competition shifts from
customer acquisition to customer retention. However, we expect mobile users to continue to grow, driven by
modest population growth and a future increase in the penetration rate as a result of the development of data-only
devices and multiple SIMs.

TDC, Sonofon and Telia are long-established operators with both GSM and 3G licenses, whereas ‘3’ is a
3G network operator that launched operations in October 2003. As at December 31, 2005, approximately 12% of
all Danish mobile subscribers were served by MVNOs other than the MNOs, the two largest being Debitel, a
MVNO with 5% retail market share, and Tele2, an enhanced MVNO with 4% retail market share. The Danish
mobile market has traditionally been one of the most competitive markets in Europe and is characterized by low
prices, resulting historically from the strong presence of discount MVNOs. The structure of the Danish mobile
market changed in 2004, however, as a result of consolidation. We acquired Telmore, an MVNO with 10% retail
market share, Sonofon acquired CBB Mobil, an MVNO with 4% retail market share and TeliaSonera acquired
Orange Denmark, an MNO with 12% retail market share. The change in the competitive landscape from five
MNOs to four, as well as the consolidation of two of the largest independent MVNOs into the MNOs, have
improved market dynamics and resulted in reduced levels of churn, lower subscriber acquisition costs and less
price pressure than historically.

In October 2001, NITA issued four national UMTS licenses to TDC, ‘3’, Telia and Orange Denmark. As
part of the agreement, the license holders were required to pay 25% of the license fee upfront, with the remaining
75% payable in equal installments over 10 years. The licenses are valid for 20 years, and under the terms of the
licenses, each holder was required to meet population coverage requirements of 30% of the population by the end of
2004 and is required to meet 80% by 2008. Following Telia’s acquisition of Orange Denmark, Telia returned the 3G
license that was previously owned by Orange Denmark to NITA. Following a subsequent auction process, Sonofon
was awarded the fourth license on December 19, 2005. The license is valid for 20 years and Sonofon is required to
meet population coverage of 30% by 2009 and 80% by 2013. As at the end of 2005, we and ‘3’ were the only
operators to have launched commercial 3G services in the Danish market.

**Danish Cable TV Market**

Cable TV is the most common form of television distribution in Denmark with 62% of all TV households.
DTH satellite distribution reaches 18% of all TV households, whereas the remaining 20% of the market is served
through the analog terrestrial network. Through our subsidiaries TDC Cable TV and Dansk Kabel TV, we are the
largest television distributor in Denmark with 1.0 million households connected to our cable network,
corresponding to 66% of all Danish cable TV households and 40% of all Danish TV households in general. Our
principal competitors include Telia Stofa, the Danish cable TV subsidiary of TeliaSonera with 8% of all TV
households, and the two pan-Scandinavian DTH operators, Canal Digital and Viasat, subsidiaries of Telenor and
MTG, respectively, who together serve 18% of all Danish TV households. In addition to being a major DTH
supplier, Canal Digital also supplies a number of individual antenna associations. Given the limited overlap between
cable TV networks in Denmark, competition between different cable TV operators is limited at the end-customer
level. Instead, cable TV operators compete with each other when new systems are being built or when contracts
with antenna co-operatives or housing associations come up for renewal.

The Danish TV distribution market is expected to develop over the next few years with TV services being
also offered on other platforms such as DTT, DSL and FTTH. On March 31, 2006, I/S DIGI-TV, a joint venture
between the broadcasters DR and TV2, launched a DTT network in Denmark as a replacement for the analog
terrestrial network, which is expected to be closed down in October 2009. Based on the experience from other
countries with established DTT operators such as Sweden, we believe there will be limited churn from the cable
TV networks to the DTT network, and that the future user base of I/S DIGI-TV will be made up mainly of
current users of the analog network or subscribers of the existing DTH operators. As with other Western
European television markets, the Danish market is characterized by the ongoing migration from analog to digital
TV and the introduction of next-generation digital TV services such as HDTV, PVR and VoD services.

Danish cable TV operators including TDC and Telia Stofa also provide broadband services over their
cable networks, and in this segment of the broadband market we are the market leader in Denmark with 54%
market share. See “Danish fixed line market — Broadband.”

There were 6.8 million mobile subscribers in Switzerland at the end of 2005, which is equivalent to a
penetration rate of 91%. This penetration level is considered to be moderate compared to some other European
markets and is expected to increase further.

In the Swiss mobile market, Swisscom Mobile, we and Orange Switzerland (100% France Telecom
owned) are the top three operators. We have grown our market share in mobile from 13% in 2000 to 19% in
2005, to become the number two player. Swisscom is the leader with a 63% market share, and Orange
Switzerland is the third largest provider with 18% market share. Our strategy in the Swiss mobile segment has
been to position ourselves as the low cost alternative to Swisscom, as evidenced by 49% of our customer base
being in the mobile pre-paid segment.

3G licenses were originally issued to the incumbent Swisscom, TDC Switzerland, Orange Switzerland
and Telefonica (Telefonica has since withdrawn from the market). The national regulator, the Federal Office of
Communication (“OFCOM”) carried out a survey in early 2005 and concluded that all three operators had met
the obligation to provide 50% population coverage by the end of 2004 for UMTS services.

Given the high and stable ARPUs seen historically, with mobile tariffs above the EU average, voice
ARPUs are likely to decline driven by outgoing and incoming tariff reductions. This will likely be partially offset
by an increase in usage. In addition, an increase in data usage is expected. Mobile termination rates were reduced
by 40% by Swisscom and by 19% by sunrise in anticipation of potential regulatory intervention.

Following the entry of several MVNOs and resellers, the level of competition in the market has increased,
and we expect pricing pressure to continue. However, the threat from MVNOs and resellers is partly mitigated,
given that regulation does not require mobile operators to open their networks. The next regulatory event
allowing for changes in license requirements is in 2008.

**Swiss Fixed Line Market**

The Swiss fixed line market is dominated by state majority-owned Swisscom. At year-end 2005, there
were 3.8 million fixed lines in operation. Total fixed line revenue peaked in 2004 at CHF 4.8 billion following a
small revenue increase generated by the gains in the broadband market.

Incumbent operator Swisscom is the leading provider of local access. Following an ongoing network
upgrade, Cablecom (the major cable operator), is able to provide two-way access to most of its customers. TDC
Switzerland is the major alternative network operator with a more than 7,000 kilometer fiber-optic network.

The cable market is highly fragmented with some 250 regional operators. Cablecom’s market share of the
cable subscriber market in 2005 was around 61%.

The Swiss telecommunications market is not subject to the EU telecommunications regulatory
framework. However, the deregulation process has generally followed EU framework albeit with a time lag. The
Swiss regulatory bodies are the OFCOM and ComCom.

Competition in the Swiss fixed line market began in 1998 following the introduction of Carrier Selection
and CPS.

**_Traditional Telephony_**

The fixed line voice market in Switzerland was only opened to competition at the beginning of 1998.
With a regulatory regime lagging several years behind the regulation in many EU countries, Swisscom continues
to maintain a high, but declining, share of the fixed line telephony.

Traditional fixed line voice revenue is declining following increased competition to Swisscom from
players such as TDC Switzerland, Tele2, Cablecom and others, as well as migration to mobile. Following the
introduction of CPS in 1998, the market share of fixed line voice resellers such as Tele2 has increased at the
expense mainly of Swisscom. The increase in competition has lead to a decline in fixed line tariffs which are still
high relative to most Western European benchmarks. With the increasing competition and the expected ULL, we
expect the tariffs to decline further. Operators owning local loop access networks are primarily Swisscom and
Cablecom.

TDC Switzerland, Tele2, Cablecom and Swisscom have all launched VoIP services. To date Cablecom is
the largest provider of VoIP services in Switzerland.

With mobile penetration at 91% we believe that fixed-to-mobile migration has to some extent already
taken place and the number of fixed lines have declined from 3,931,000 lines in 2004 to 3,822,000 at the end of
2005. We expect that the decline in the number of traditional fixed voice lines will continue as customers’
take-up of VoIP services increases

own backbone network, we are well positioned to compete, and to benefit from the new regulatory situation.

**_Broadband_**

The Swiss broadband market has been developing rapidly over the last couple of years with the number of
connections increasing from 1,261,000 in 2004 to 1,563,000 in 2005, leading to an increase in the household
penetration. DSL overtook cable modems as the leading technology, in terms of number of connections, in 2003
and now has 1,010,000 connections compared to 553,000 connections by cable modem.

The Swiss market has lagged materially behind the EU in terms of liberalization of the
telecommunications market. Consequently, ULL implementation has been delayed. Swisscom has often used the
courts to block efforts to spur competition and has fought moves by the Swiss competition authority and
ComCom to unbundle the local loop and provide leased lines at cost-oriented prices. A revised
telecommunications law providing for such opening of ULL networks was passed by the Swiss Parliament on
March 24, 2006. A 100 day referendum period expires on July 13, 2006. If there is no referendum and the
ordinances implementing the law are finalized, the new law enters into force. It is now anticipated that this will
be in the first quarter of 2007. Although unlikely, it is possible that organizations opposed to the law could force
a public vote, which would further delay enactment by at least a year and could potentially result in enactment
being prevented. Regulatory changes that may take place in the next few years are likely to favor alternative
operators such as TDC Switzerland.

The Swiss cable TV market is expected to grow with competitive triple play offerings, in particular by
Cablecom, which holds a 21% broadband market share. Cablecom launched telephony services over its cable
network in February 2003 in order to cross-sell a third service to its established significant base of cable-modem
and cable TV customers. Swisscom remains the dominant DSL player, using the Bluwin brand.

Operators like us, without their own local access, suffer from the current regulatory environment. As ULL
has not yet been implemented, Swisscom is the sole DSL connection provider. The business models for DSL
resellers are currently suffering from thin margins. TDC Switzerland is the leading alternative DSL provider with
a rapidly growing customer base that stood at 182,416 at December 31, 2005.

We believe our broadband business will benefit from expected regulatory changes such as the
introduction of ULL.

We are the leading provider of communications solutions in Denmark, the second-largest
telecommunications provider in Switzerland, and we have a significant presence in selected Northern and Central
European telecommunications markets. Over the past decade, we have transformed our business from a
traditional provider of landline and mobile telephony services in the Danish market into a Danish-based
European provider of communications solutions. At the end of 2005, we had more than 15 million customers in
Europe, including more than 9 million mobile customers. In 2005, we had revenue of DKK 46,588 million
(€6,245 million) and EBITDA before special items of DKK 13,003 million (€1,743 million).

Our five main business lines and their contribution to our revenue and EBITDA before special items for
the year ended December 31, 2005 are:

Š **TDC Solutions (46% of revenue, 51% of EBITDA before special items) provides communications**
services primarily in Denmark and the other Nordic countries. Its activities include landline telephony
services, convergence products (combined landline and mobile telephony), broadband solutions, data
communications services and internet services, leased lines, sale of terminals and installation and
advanced security and hosting services. In addition to offering telephony and data communications
services through its Danish network, TDC Solutions operates a pan-Nordic network mainly for
business customers through its wholly-owned subsidiary TDC Song, provides telecommunications
infrastructure products to Swedish business customers through its wholly-owned subsidiary TDC
Dotcom and provides IP/LAN infrastructure for business customers through its wholly-owned
subsidiary NetDesign. TDC Solutions also provides landline and data communications services in
Hungary through its 63.4% owned subsidiary HTCC.

Š **TDC Mobile International (34% of revenue, 22% of EBITDA before special items) provides mobile**
telecommunications services in Denmark and a number of other European countries. In addition to
being the leading provider of mobile telecommunications services in Denmark, TDC Mobile
International provides mobile telephony services in Germany through its wholly-owned subsidiary
Talkline, and in Lithuania and Latvia through its wholly-owned subsidiary Bité. TDC Mobile
International also holds a 19.6% stake in the Polish mobile operator Polkomtel (which is in the
process of being sold) and a 15.0% stake in the Austrian mobile operator One.

Š **TDC Switzerland (21% of revenue, 20% of EBITDA before special items) is the second-largest**
telecommunications provider in Switzerland, operating under the “sunrise” brand. Its activities include
mobile and landline telephony and internet services. TDC Switzerland has its own national fixed line
backbone, GSM and ISP networks, and is further developing and expanding its mobile network based
on EDGE and UMTS technology. The Swiss Parliament recently adopted ULL legislation that, if
enacted, will require the incumbent operator to grant access to its local loop to alternative providers,
which we believe will benefit our fixed line business.

Š **TDC Cable TV (5% of revenue, 4% of EBITDA before special items) is a Danish provider of cable**
TV, internet services and VoIP. TDC Cable TV supplies cable TV to more than 1.0 million
households by way of a 862 MHz fully digitized hybrid fiber coaxial cable network. TDC Cable TV
offers its customers triple play service (voice, broadband and television in one package).

Š **Other activities include TDC Services, which mainly provides business services for the TDC Group’s**
domestic business lines. The Other activities segment also includes intercompany eliminations.

Please note that the revenue and EBITDA before special items figures do not add up to 100%, due to
intragroup eliminations.

**Our Business Strengths**

We believe that the following are our key business strengths:

Š **_Leading positions in Denmark and Switzerland._** We are the incumbent and leading
telecommunications provider in Denmark and the second-largest telecommunications provider in
Switzerland. In our Danish fixed line business, we have a market share of 81% in landline telephony
and a retail market share of 72% in DSL, as measured by subscribers. In mobile, we are the number
one service provider in Denmark with a 41% market share. In cable TV, we are the number one
operator in Denmark with a 66% market share, providing TV services to approximately 40% of all
Danish households, and we have a 52% market share in the Danish pay TV market. In Denmark,
where we have a leading position as the former incumbent operator we believe that the market is


-----

to capitalize on market liberalization, including the recent legislative changes on ULL. We also have a
leading position in Lithuania and a significant presence in Germany, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia
and Hungary, as well as minority stakes in businesses in Poland (which we are in the process of
selling) and Austria.

Š **_Highly diverse telecommunications business._** We are a diverse company in terms of product
offerings, customer base and geography. In our key geographic markets, we are present in almost
every major area of the telecommunications sector; for example, we offer landline telephony,
broadband, mobile telephony and cable TV in Denmark. Our diversity in product offerings reduces
our exposure to technological substitution and technology and platform migration. For example,
although the Danish fixed line market has been affected by fixed-to-mobile substitution, our mobile
MOU have increased as a result of this substitution trend. Similarly, our strong market presence in
broadband and cable TV allows us to mitigate the decline in fixed voice usage by offering our
broadband customers VoIP as an alternative to PSTN services. Our wide range of product offerings
also affords us opportunities for synergies across platforms, allowing us to bundle and cross-sell
products and services and to tailor business solutions to our customers’ particular needs. We benefit
from a diverse customer base that consists of retail and wholesale customers and residential and
business customers from a wide range of industries. We also benefit from geographic diversity
through our operations in Switzerland, the Baltic region and other Northern and Central European
markets, which reduces our exposure to economic downturns in any one country.

Š **_Extensive network infrastructure._** We have the most extensive telecommunications network
infrastructure in Denmark, where our network has been fully upgraded to digital. We operate our own
networks in Switzerland, the Nordic countries, Lithuania, Latvia and Hungary. Our access network
reaches almost 100% of Denmark’s population and our DSL network can deliver speeds of at least
512 Kbps to 98% of Danish households and businesses and at least 4 Mbps to 90% of Danish
households and businesses. We expect to be able to deliver 8 Mbps DSL service to 85% of the Danish
population by the end of 2006. We view our access to such a high number of end users and locations
as a key advantage in marketing and selling our products. Our integrated network structure provides
us with the ability to cross-sell mobile, fixed line, cable TV and internet services and to capitalize on
strong brand awareness in Denmark and strong product offerings across our business lines, which may
result in reduced subscriber acquisition costs, increased ARPU and reduced churn.

Our extensive network allows us to provide wholesale services to our fixed line retail competitors, as
they often use our network. Our position as a network access provider in the Danish wholesale market
provides a stable source of revenue as in most cases we have retained the wholesale component of any
business that we have lost to competitors at the retail level. We also own and operate a backbone
network in the Nordic region, which is one of Europe’s fastest broadband networks for data, internet
and voice traffic. We believe our past investments in network infrastructure will lower our present
operating costs and will lower our capital expenditures in the future.

Š **_Strong financial performance and high cash flow generation._** Despite a relatively high level of
competition in Denmark in both the fixed and mobile business areas in recent years, we delivered
organic growth in EBITDA before special items of 4.0% in 2005. We have also steadily reduced our
costs, in particular labor costs in Denmark, and have disposed of assets, where reasonable and
profitable. As a result of our increased revenue, successful operating cost management and disciplined
capital expenditure, we have significantly increased our operating cash flow and cash flow before debt
service. We generated cash flow from operating activities of DKK 8,691 million (€1,165 million) for
the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. We intend to continue to create value through active
portfolio management.

Š **_Experienced management team and strong equity sponsorship._** Our management team of industry
professionals has significant experience in the mobile, fixed line, cable TV and internet services markets
in Denmark and abroad and has a proven track record in growing our businesses, including our Chief
Executive Officer, Henning Dyremose, who has held his current position since 1998 and was previously
the Minister of Finance in Denmark, and our Chief Financial Officer, Hans Munk Nielsen, who has held
his current position since 1991. As one of the longest serving and highly regarded telecommunications
management teams in Europe, our management team has demonstrated its ability to grow the business
and increase EBITDA before special items in both favorable and adverse market conditions.

Our principal shareholders are a group of investment funds, each of which is respectively advised or
managed directly or indirectly by Apax Blackstone KKR Permira or Providence all leading

**Our Business Strategy**

The key components of our strategy are as follows:

Š **_Maintain position as market leader in Denmark and seek to benefit from regulatory changes in_**
**_Switzerland._** We intend to build on our position as the incumbent provider of integrated telephony,
broadband and cable TV services in Denmark and to benefit from regulatory changes that may
enhance our position in Switzerland as the leading alternative to the incumbent operator. We seek to
achieve this by cross-selling mobile, fixed line, cable TV and internet services, and capitalizing on
strong brand awareness in Denmark and Switzerland. In Denmark, we will continue to strengthen our
market position through a full set of product and service offerings, including triple play service and
convergence products. We also intend to capitalize on our expansive network, access to content
expertise and content delivery technology from our cable TV business. We will seek to strengthen our
leadership by earning our customers’ long-term loyalty through retention programs and by offering
the best customer experience and value for money. We seek to drive technology transitions where
profitable and to invest in marketing to maintain and refresh brand awareness. We are encouraged by
the recent Swiss ULL legislation, and believe that, if ULL is deployed expeditiously and on
satisfactory terms, we will be in a good position to expand our customer base, geographical reach and
product and service portfolio in Switzerland.

Š **_Continue to increase efficiencies._** We seek to continue to increase operational and capital
expenditure efficiencies to improve operating margins and increase cash flows. We intend to continue
to reduce headcount in Denmark, particularly in our fixed line business. We will focus on a strict cost
management policy and intend to maintain a disciplined capital expenditure program. We currently
expect to reduce domestic headcount in the order of 5% per annum until the end of 2007.

Š **_Focus on selected growth opportunities in broadband and mobile services._** We seek to take
advantage of the growth in broadband and VoIP penetration in Denmark, in order to partially offset
the anticipated overall decline in traditional voice. The broadband market in Denmark is rapidly
growing and we expect penetration to increase from 54% in 2005 to 80% by 2010. To expand our
product offerings and to counter emerging technologies, we plan to offer broadband at high speeds
over cable and DSL with full triple play service, an area in which we have expertise. We also intend to
strengthen our mobile business by offering innovative products such as data services (mobile
broadband) via the UMTS network (3G), and increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty, which we
believe will lead to a moderate increase in our subscriber base, a decline in churn and an increasing
usage of services. As we have done with our UMTS roll out to date, we intend to continue our policy
of entering the market for new products only at a stage where we consider they are sufficiently mature
for profitable investment.

Š **_Increase focus on core activities._** We will increasingly focus on our core activities and markets, and
intend to review our activities across the board to determine the most attractive businesses for organic
expansion and further investments, where reasonable and justified by expected returns, or,
alternatively, for divestiture. For instance, we believe that our comprehensive fixed line Nordic
network acquired through the Song Networks acquisition (now TDC Song) gives us a low-cost
opportunity to serve our customers on a pan-Nordic basis, improve our market position, presence and
cost structure and challenge competitors by leveraging opportunities offered by technology transitions
and customer orientation. TDC Song’s IP-VPN business in the Nordic region provides a strong
platform from which to further our growth. We will continue to review our existing holdings of
minority interests and non-core businesses to determine whether to continue to maintain these going
forward or, where suitable, to make disposals.

Š **_Focus on de-leveraging._** We intend to implement the above strategies with a focus on cash flow
generation in order to reduce our debt levels going forward. We seek to achieve this through further
organic growth in our business, further reduction of cost of employees, discipline in our capital
expenditures, increasing our efficiencies and active management of our portfolio of assets. We will
continue to evaluate the future potential of each of our assets with a view to either dispose of them at a
profit, or to build on their current positions. We believe that these measures and the above strategies
will enable us to maximize our cash flow and margin and deliver our capital structure.


-----

Over the past ten years, we have evolved from a provider of traditional landline telephony services and
cable TV to a provider of integrated telecommunications solutions with both traditional and substitution
technology offerings. We have expanded our business lines to include internet services and bundled products. We
have built a digitalised network that reaches almost 100% of Denmark’s population.

We were founded by the Danish State as Tele Denmark A/S in November 1990. In April 1994, we made a
public offering of ordinary shares, the majority in the form of American Depositary Receipts, reducing the
ownership of the Danish State in our share capital to 51%. In January 1998, our shareholders completed our
privatization by repurchasing and canceling the Danish State’s remaining shares in Tele Denmark A/S. In 2000,
Tele Denmark A/S changed its name to TDC A/S. In December 2005, the Purchaser, a direct wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Issuer, initiated the Tender Offer and subsequently acquired 88.2% of our capital stock. For a
description of the Acquisition and related Transactions, see “The Acquisition and Related Financings.”

Through a series of acquisitions and investments, we have expanded geographically from a mainly
Danish telecommunications business into a Danish-based European provider of communications solutions. In the
beginning of 2001, we established our Swiss business line, TDC Switzerland, which operates under the
trademark sunrise. In 2001, sunrise merged with the Swiss mobile service provider diAx, making us the secondlargest communications provider in Switzerland. We have expanded into other parts of Europe through
acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Song Networks AB (now TDC Song), a leading Nordic
telecommunications operator, in September 2004. In recent years we have also divested certain of our non-core
businesses, including TDC Directories, our print and electronic web-based directory business that operated in
Denmark, Sweden and Finland, which we sold in 2005.

**_Overview of Our Activities by Service Area and Geography_**

Revenue, EBITDA and customer numbers by business line and geographic market are specified in the
table below. This revenue was generated by our various business lines operating in Denmark, Switzerland and
ten other countries in Europe. Since 2001, approximately half of our revenue has come from operations outside
of Denmark. See “Operating and Financial Review and Prospects.”

**_TDC Solutions_**

TDC Solutions offers a wide range of communications services in Denmark, the other Nordic countries
and Hungary. Through the companies TDC Solutions A/S, TDC Song, HTCC (in which we hold a 63.4%
interest), TDC Dotcom and NetDesign, TDC Solutions provides landline telephony services, data
communications and internet services, including broadband solutions, convergence products, triple play services,
security and hosting services, leased lines and sale of terminals and installation. Traditional landline telephony
continues to be our largest business area, but we expect that traditional landline telephony will become less
significant to our business as many of our customers switch to our mobile and VoIP telephony


-----

largest customer segments are landline and DSL. In 2005, TDC Solutions’ revenue was approximately DKK 21.6
billion (€2.9 billion), an increase of 16% from 2004. Landline telephony and data communications and internet
services are our two largest business areas, accounting for 71% of revenue in 2005. At year-end 2005, TDC
Solutions had 12,231 full-time employee equivalents.

**_Business Areas_**

_Landline telephony_

TDC Solutions’ landline telephony business consists of traditional landline telephony and IP telephony
for the residential and business markets. TDC Solutions also provides wholesale network access to domestic and
international telecommunications operators. With revenue of approximately DKK 10.5 billion (€1.4 billion) in
2005, traditional landline telephony represents the largest share of TDC Solutions’ revenue, corresponding to
48% of TDC Solutions’ revenue, compared with 52% in 2004. Approximately DKK 1.6 billion (€0.2 billion) of
its revenue was from TDC Song and HTCC.

Our product offerings for residential customers include traditional PSTN/ISDN telephony products,
“Duét” convergence products and IP telephony, which was launched in 2006. Our basic PSTN product, which is
a basic telephone subscription, is currently offered at a price of DKK 119 (€16) per month (including VAT) and
includes line rental. In addition, a charge per minute is added (for example, landline calls are charged at DKK
0.25 (€0.04) per minute in peak hours (including VAT) and DKK 0.125 (€0.017) per minute in off-peak hours
(including VAT). The basic PSTN product is also offered as an ISDN solution, with two telephone lines in one
subscription.

To counter migration toward mobile and IP-based telephony technologies and to meet the market’s
increased focus on flat rate products, TDC Solutions launched “TDC Samtale” in 2004, a telephone service
package giving unlimited landline minutes in off-peak hours at a flat monthly rate of DKK 159 (€21) (including
VAT). As a continuation of the success of TDC Samtale, TDC Solutions launched “TDC Samtale Døgn” in 2005,
extending the hours of unlimited national landline minutes to both day and night at a flat monthly rate of DKK
199 (€27) (including VAT). The number of customers having subscribed to these products has grown
significantly since they were launched and totalled 321,000 at year-end 2005.

Duét is a convergence product which bundles fixed line with a mobile subscription and is offered in
several feature packages. Duét offers among other features the ability to forward calls from the fixed line
telephone to the mobile phone at discount rates. We expect the Duét product to reduce churn resulting from
fixed-to-mobile substitution.

In 2006, we launched VoIP for residential customers. VoIP is an IP telephony product that provides voice
quality comparable to a PSTN network. Although we have not yet fully marketed our VoIP product, it is
currently offered as a flat rate product at a monthly price of DKK 109 (€15) (including VAT) and includes
unlimited national landline minutes in off-peak hours. As an alternative, VoIP with unlimited national landline
minutes day and night is offered at a monthly price of DKK 129 (€17) (including VAT). Subscribers of these
VoIP packages must pay an additional charge per minute for calls to international or mobile numbers.

TDC Solutions’ product portfolio for business customers consists of the traditional PSTN telephone
services ISDN products convergence products as well as IP telephony solutions The basic PSTN product


-----

In addition to traditional fixed line telephony, we offer business customers the convergence product
Plusnet Connect (“PNC”). PNC is a combined fixed line and mobile telephony product offered in one package in
cooperation with TDC Mobile International and is sold exclusively by TDC Solutions. PNC operates as a virtual
private network, enabling the customers’ employees to use the same internal telephone numbers for both landline
and mobile phones. PNC also offers discounts for all internal calls as well as advanced call-forwarding features.

TDC Solutions also offers IP telephony solutions to business customers and is currently the largest
supplier in the Danish business market.

_Data communications and internet services_

TDC Solutions’ data communications and internet services business consists mainly of broadband
subscription packages, private IP-based networks, dial-up solutions and data communications services. In 2005,
revenue from data communications and internet services was DKK 5.0 billion (€0.7 billion), corresponding to
23% of TDC Solution’s revenue, compared with 21% in 2004. TDC Solutions’ broadband customer base rose
from 549,000 in 2004 to 689,000 at year-end 2005, thereby achieving a broadband market share of approximately
45% based on the number of subscriptions. In 2005, dial-up internet subscriptions decreased by 24% to 307,000.

TDC Solutions’ broadband subscription packages are usually offered as a flat rate service with unlimited
uploads and downloads. The product range in DSL for residential customers spans from a connection with a
downstream bandwidth of 160 Kbps and an upstream bandwidth of 128 Kbps at a price of DKK 199 (€27)
(including VAT) per month to a connection with a downstream bandwidth of 8 Mbps and an upstream bandwidth
of 512 Kbps at a price of DKK 799 (€107) (including VAT) per month. At the end of 2005, 38% of our DSL
residential customers subscribed to a connection with a downstream bandwidth of 512 Kbps or less, 41%
subscribed to a connection with a downstream bandwidth of 1 Mbps and the remaining 22% subscribed to a
connection with a downstream bandwidth of 2 Mbps or more. TDC Solutions also offers a unit-priced broadband
service targeting low-volume users such as existing internet dial-up customers. Currently, this product is offered
with a downstream bandwidth of 2 Mbps and an upstream bandwidth of 128 Kbps at a price of DKK 99 (€13) per
month (including VAT) plus a volume-based tariff of DKK 0.75 (€0.10) per megabyte (including VAT).

For business customers, TDC Solutions offers DSL at downstream bandwidths ranging between 512 Kbps
and 8 Mbps and SHDSL which features symmetric upload and download speeds at bandwidths of up to 2 Mbps.
Furthermore, we offer DSL solutions for business customers which include DSL connections to the employees’
residences, allowing employees to work from home. At the end of 2005, 10% of our DSL business customers
subscribed to a connection with a downstream bandwidth of 512 Kbps or less, 54% subscribed to a connection
with a downstream bandwidth of 1 Mbps and the remaining 36% subscribed to a connection with a downstream
bandwidth of between 2 Mbps and 8 Mbps.

In addition to DSL and SHDSL products, TDC Solutions offers business customers a wide range of other
services including service level agreements and security packages, such as firewall and antivirus programs. For
some business customers, these services are delivered free of charge, which means that they are bundled with the
line product. Residential customers must pay an extra fee for these services.

In 2004, TDC was the first Danish operator to launch a nationwide network of wireless hotspots in
selected geographical areas, from where the internet can be accessed. At year-end 2005, TDC had 650 wireless
hotspots in Denmark.

In 2005, TDC Solutions launched the TVoIP product TDC TV, so that it is now possible to offer
customers triple play products. TDC TV is offered in two packages: Basic, at DKK 99 (€13) per month
(including VAT) and Family at DKK 199 €27 per month (including VAT). The Basic package includes 5
channels and the Family package includes 20 channels.

_Terminal equipment_

TDC Solutions’ terminal equipment business consists of the sale and installation of hardware ranging
from handsets and computers to large switchboards and the provision of related service agreements. With
revenue of approximately DKK 3.2 billion (€0.43 billion) in 2005, terminal equipment was the third-largest
contributor to TDC Solutions’ revenue, corresponding to a 15% share of TDC Solutions’ revenue compared with
14% in 2004.

Customer premises equipment (“CPE”) is the hardware required to handle telephony and data traffic for
both business and residential customers. We sell CPE designed for the residential market at our TDC Shops. Our
Business Centers sell CPE products and services to our business customers. TDC Shops and our Business
Centers are further described below


-----

business corporations, to single telephone apparatuses sold to residential or small business customers. Data CPE
consists mainly of routers, switches, DSL modems and other bridging equipment used for creating LAN and
WAN solutions.

Most CPE is sold to the customer while a small part of CPE is leased. We offer service agreements in
conjunction with equipment sales, pursuant to which we agree to make certain repairs to the subject equipment
within specified time limits.

_Leased lines_

The leased lines business offers domestic and international leased line services to businesses on a retail
basis and to other telecommunications operators on a wholesale basis and offers analog as well as digital circuits.
Leased lines can be used for transporting both telephony and data traffic. Revenue from leased lines was DKK
1,538 million (€207 million) in 2005, corresponding to 7% of TDC Solutions’ revenue compared to 6% in 2004.

TDC Solutions offers point-to-point connections with guaranteed bandwidth to its leased line customers.
Digital leased lines are offered with different bandwidths ranging from 64 Kbps to more than 1 Gbps. For
bandwidths up to 2 Mbps all prices are based on list prices approved by NITA, while prices for products above
2 Mbps are negotiated on commercial terms. Monthly subscription prices for a 2 Mbps connection range from
DKK 1,200 to 4,200 (€161 to €563) (excluding VAT) depending on the length of the leased line. For telephony
purposes, a bandwidth up to around 2 Mbps is sufficient while bandwidths above 2 Mbps are usually used for
high speed data communication.

**_Customers, Sales and Distribution_**

TDC Solutions has three sales divisions: TDC Residential, TDC Business and TDC Wholesale. These
three sales divisions also sell mobile and cable TV products and services offered by TDC Mobile International
and TDC Cable TV, respectively.

_TDC Residential_

TDC Residential targets sales to residential customers in Denmark, consisting of approximately
2.5 million households, and to businesses with a single employee (“SoHos”). There are approximately 190,000
SoHos in Denmark.

TDC Residential has three main sales channels: Sales and Support, TDC Butik (TDC Shops) and TDC
Online. These three sales channels account for almost all TDC Residential sales. Sales and Support generates
approximately 54% of total residential product sales, TDC Shops generates approximately 29%, TDC Online
generates approximately 12% and the remaining 5% are generated by other sales channels, such as TDC
Business.

Sales and Support, which operates 16 call centers throughout Denmark, generates sales through both
outbound telemarketing and inbound calls. Our Sales and Support division is further described in the section
“Business—Customer Care.”

TDC Shops targets residential consumers and to a lesser extent SoHos. TDC Shops has 58 shops, all
owned by TDC Solutions, located in major towns throughout Denmark. TDC Shops markets the full product
portfolios of TDC Solutions, TDC Mobil and TDC Cable TV. TDC Shops employs approximately 450
employees.

With approximately 1.7 million transactions every year and a nationwide retail chain consisting of stores
in high-exposure locations, TDC Shops plays a key role in strengthening awareness of our brand and product
offerings. TDC Shops also distributes catalogues of our products and services to approximately 2 million
households in Denmark, 19 times per year.

In cooperation with TDC’s Business Centers, TDC Shops has tested a new “Shop-in-Shop” sales concept
targeting business customers. This concept involves putting a designated sales and service desk for business
customers inside TDC Shops stores. Our Business Centers and TDC Shops intend to implement a concept similar
to the “Shop-in-Shop” pilot program in select stores across Denmark


-----

(excluding TDC Samtale). TDC Online was launched to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty while at the
same time reducing incoming call volumes to Sales and Support. TDC Online has 320,000 visitors every week.
There are 55 employees at TDC Online.

TDC Residential uses a variety of media for advertising including TV, magazines, sponsorships and
direct marketing. Besides improving sales, our marketing strategy aims at creating loyalty and strengthening the
TDC brand. The marketing department is divided into four sub departments, “Marketing Sales,” “Loyalty,”
“Production” and “Positioning.” TDC Shops also operates a marketing department that handles production of
sales catalogs. The sales force in the residential market consists of internally employed staff, some of which are
paid on commission.

TDC Solutions invoices its residential customers, and most of its business customers, quarterly.
Subscriptions are paid in advance each quarter, whereas traffic use is billed in the following quarter. As
broadband subscriptions are predominantly flat rate products, almost all broadband payments are made in
advance. We intend to maintain these payment policies, which are favorable to TDC.

_TDC Business_

In Denmark, TDC Business targets companies with more than one employee and the public sector. There
are approximately 123,000 companies with more than one employee in Denmark, and TDC currently serves
approximately 57% of these. In the Nordic region (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland), TDC Business has
started to target the approximately 3,200 corporations that have a presence in more than one Nordic country.

TDC Business segments its customers based on expected revenue streams from such customer:

Š _Key Account segment — Targets customers expected to generate revenue of more than DKK 10_
million (€1.3 million). Our Key Account team services 154 companies. Revenue from Key Account
customers totaled DKK 1.8 billion (€0.2 billion) in 2005. Key Account customers are served by a
dedicated team of account managers that typically handle 1 to 3 customers.

Š _Public Account segment — Targets all public sector companies in Denmark, and presently includes_
344 customers. Revenue from Public Account customers totaled DKK 1.2 billion (€0.2 billion) in
2005. Public Account customers are public organizations and are all managed under a framework
agreement.

Š _Large Account segment — Targets customers expected to generate revenue of more than DKK 500,000_
(€67,020). Presently, TDC services 735 Danish Large Account companies. In 2005, revenue from Large
Account customers amounted to DKK 760 million (€102 million). Large Account customers are handled
by account managers, who each on average handle 30 customers. Working closely with large customers
has proven relatively effective in maintaining customer satisfaction, which has improved for three
consecutive years.

Š _Business Center segment — Targets companies with more than two employees expected to generate_
revenue of more than DKK 30,000 (€4,021). Currently, the Business Center segment services
approximately 58,500 customers. Revenue from Business Center customers totaled DKK 2.3 billion
(€0.3 billion) in 2005.

In the first quarter of 2006, TDC Business established a new sales segment called Nordic Account,
targeting sales to pan-Nordic customers, which are customers with a presence in more than one Nordic country.
Selected customers from the four segments mentioned above will be moved into this new segment, which we
expect may include approximately 400 customers.

In addition to TDC Business account managers, TDC Business conducts sales and provides customer
service through call centers and TDC Business online services.

Business Center customers are targeted through nine shops, located throughout Denmark. We intend to
establish up to five new shops in 2006 in Denmark, located in areas with a high density of businesses.

The business sales force consists of approximately 550 persons who are partly paid on a commission
basis. The business marketing organization operates in parallel with the sales organization. Our marketing is
focused on increasing sales through TDC Business online services, as online sales are cheaper for us than sales
through our sales representatives


-----

Wholesale generated revenue of DKK 3,338 million (€447 million). TDC Wholesale has approximately 200 fulltime employee equivalents. In the domestic markets, our main wholesale landline products are service provisions
to PSTN and ISDN resellers (with revenue of DKK 687 million (€92 million) in 2005), leased lines, bitstream
access and ULL access (with revenue of DKK 940 million (€126 million) in 2005), and prefix and incoming
traffic (with revenue of DKK 725 million (€97 million) in 2005).

TDC Wholesale has contracts with 56 domestic operators in addition to its affiliated operators, TDC
Mobile International and TDC Cable TV. The top three external domestic customers based on revenue are Tele2,
Telia and Sonofon. Business with domestic operators is to a large extent regulated by NITA, with prices
determined by an LRAIC model and by cost documentation.

Our international carrier services conducted through our business line TDC Carrier Services operates
primarily in the European market with inbound international traffic (with revenue of DKK 260 million
(€35 million) in 2005), international transit traffic (with revenue of DKK 505 million (€68 million) in 2005) and
international capacity products (with revenue of DKK 108 million (€14 million) in 2005) as the major products.
TDC Carrier Services has contracts with 206 international operators. TDC Carrier Services’ top three
international customers are TeliaSonera AB, Cable & Wireless and MCI. The international market for carrier
services is characterized by economies of scale and is highly competitive with very low margins.

**_Customer Care_**

_TDC Residential._ Customer care at TDC Residential is mainly performed by the Sales and Support
division, which has approximately 920 full-time employee equivalents, including 822 employees working in its
16 call centers in Denmark. TDC Residential call centers handle more than 1.5 million calls a year. The call
centers consist of the following departments.

Š Customer Service handles customer complaints and billing requests.

Š Hotline is responsible for answering customer calls and e-mails relating to internet products such as
DSL lines and DSL equipment, VoIP and TDC TV.

Š Fault Reporting handles all fault reports received via inbound calls or e-mails from fixed line
customers. Fault Reporting conducts fault searching and line measuring as well as reservation of
technicians to repair faults.

Š The Save team is responsible for customer retention activities.

Š Outbound and Inbound Sales handles outbound telemarketing and incoming sales calls.

TDC Residential’s back office department, which is not part of our call centers, consists of specialists
who support our sales department.

The TDC Residential call centers operate with a service level of 80/20, meaning that 80% of all contacts
to a given incoming line will be answered within 20 seconds. This makes TDC one of the leading operators in
terms of call center service level and helps secure a high level of customer satisfaction. Customer service
performance is monitored on a daily basis and is reported to management. TDC has not outsourced any customer
care activities.

_TDC Business. Customer care at TDC Business is organized according to the following departments:_

Š Inbound Sales handles sales, consultancy and order registration resulting from inbound calls with
respect to business products. Inbound Sales representatives handle all calls in connection to sales
campaigns and try to retain customers seeking to terminate their subscription.

Š Customer Handling primarily handles the large customers in the Key Account, Public Account and
Nordic Account segments where each customer has a dedicated number to call and dedicated
employees in customer handling who have special knowledge of each customer’s lines and equipment.

Š Helpdesk/Fault Handling is responsible for handling customers calling to report faults, for monitoring
customer lines and equipment, directing fault messages to other parts of TDC, supporting of on-site
technicians and maintaining quality levels on error handling


-----

Š Concept Center handles some of our special business-related products such as hosting products and
DSL solutions sold to the employees of our customers.

TDC receives significantly fewer complaints in relation to its market share compared to its major
competitors. In 2005, approximately 60% of complaints filed against us with the Danish Telecommunications
Complaint Board were either decided in favor of TDC or rejected by the Danish Telecommunications Complaint
Board.

**_TDC Song_**

In the fall of 2004, TDC Solutions acquired TDC Song, a leading Nordic telecommunications operator
with an extensive pan-Nordic network. TDC Song offers a wide range of services in data communication and
telephony in Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark, with IP-VPN and internet access as its main services. We
have integrated TDC Song’s Danish network and operations into TDC Solutions.

TDC Song targets business and wholesale markets in Sweden, Norway and Finland, as well as the
residential market in Sweden. In the fourth quarter of 2005, TDC Song launched broadband services in the
Swedish residential market at speeds of up to 28 Mbps. Revenue in 2005 amounted to DKK 2,340 million
(€314 million), with 47% from traditional voice products while 35% came from IP-VPN and internet products.
EBITDA amounted to DKK 330 million (€44 million) in 2005.

TDC Song’s main competitive advantage is the ability to offer efficient and technically advanced
communications solutions in combination with quality customer service. Business customers are connected at
competitive prices to TDC Song’s fiber network, which offers the most extensive pan-Nordic coverage.

See “Business — Network” for more information on TDC Song.

**_HTCC (Hungary)_**

TDC holds 63.4% of the shares in HTCC, which, through its wholly-owned subsidiaries Hungarotel and
PanTel, provides telephony, ISDN, internet, broadband and other telecommunications services in Hungary. The
company owns and operates virtually all existing public telephone exchanges and local loop telecommunications
network facilities in the Hungarotel Operating Areas, covering 6.6% of the Hungarian population. HTCC was,
until the expiration of its exclusivity rights in 2002, the sole provider of non-cellular local voice telephone
services in these areas.

In addition HTCC offers data transmission and other value-added services, including broadband DSL
internet access and services, dial-up internet access and services as well as VoIP services for international calls.
HTCC offers its business customers high speed internet access, data transport services, including managed leased
lines, ATM services and frame relay services, virtual private networks and web hosting.

HTCC is also a wholesaler providing capacity and transport services on its network to other wireline and
wireless telecommunications providers and internet service providers. HTCC’s international network allows it to
transfer voice, data and internet traffic to and from Hungary.

As of December 31, 2005, HTCC had approximately 158,000 access lines in service within the
Hungarotel Operating Areas and provided Carrier Selection and CPS calling services to 19,000 active customers
outside the Hungarotel Operating Areas. Outside this area HTCC had an additional 34,000 access lines.

**_Competition_**

Since the full liberalization of the Danish telecommunications market in mid-1996, we have faced intense
competition in the market for domestic landline telephony services based primarily on price. Features of the
domestic landline market include a large number of operators, many new entrants and public regulation aimed
particularly at TDC. In the market for domestic and international long distance telephony services, competition
has been enhanced by regulations requiring us to permit other telecommunications companies to interconnect
with our network at rates controlled by NITA. These rates have been reduced numerous times over the past five
years, resulting in a continuous reduction of end user prices. New technology that enables VoIP has further
intensified competition


-----

further strengthened its position in the pan-Nordic market by acquiring Dotcom Solutions in Sweden and
introducing broadband solutions for residential customers in the Swedish market. In 2005, we also increased our
ownership share in the Hungarian company HTCC.

There are four key players in the Danish landline market. Tele2 covers around 65% of Danish households
and is our largest external wholesale customer. Telia has its own infrastructure and acts as a wholesaler and
retailer and provides fixed and mobile services under the Telia brand. Telia also offers cable TV and broadband
services under the Telia Stofa brand. Cybercity (acquired by Norwegian Telenor in May 2005) develops,
manages and sells broadband solutions with a particular focus on the small-to-medium enterprise (“SME”), home
office and high-end consumer markets. GlobalConnect, a privately owned backbone operator, has a fiber-optic
network which covers most parts of Denmark and Northern Germany.

Customer migration from dial-up internet to broadband solutions in Denmark continued in 2005, and the
broadband penetration of Danish households rose to approximately 54% in 2005. To counter the increasing
competition in the broadband market, TDC Solutions introduced a number of product and pricing promotions in
2005, including higher speeds for the same prices and reduced connection fees. In 2005, TDC Solutions also
doubled the maximum DSL speed for Danish residential customers with the launch of 8 Mbps.

Traffic volumes have declined steadily during the past years. This trend can be explained by fixed-tomobile substitution and increased competition. Furthermore, the emergence of competitively priced IP-VPN
solutions has made it possible for business customers with several branches to establish their own networks,
based on IP-VPN, allowing them to route traffic between branches within their own network instead of through
the public telephone network. The result of this is a sharp decline in billed MOU for business customers, which
has partly been offset by an increase in internet services and data communication revenue.

A number of our competitors such as Cybercity and Tele2 have introduced VoIP at very competitive flat
rate prices including all traffic with the exception of calls to mobile. We have launched IP telephony in
cooperation with TDC Cable TV using the cable TV network and a VoIP product using DSL in order to compete
for the customers who migrate towards VoIP. We estimate that the emergence of VoIP has not yet had a
significant impact on subscriber and traffic volumes, but we expect that migration to VoIP will cannibalize a
substantial part of our PSTN customers with a significant impact on our financial result.

In the Danish PSTN market, there is not much differentiation between products except through the
packaging of different combinations of features. Accordingly, if a competitor in the PSTN market offers a
successful PSTN package, we believe we could offer a comparable product in a matter of weeks. For example,
one of our competitors in the PSTN market offered a successful flat rate product and we were able to offer a
comparable product within weeks.

For more information on TDC’s competitors and our competitive position in the Danish
telecommunications market, see “Industry.” For more information on the impact of regulations on our business,
see “— Regulatory Environment.”

**_TDC Mobile International_**

TDC Mobile International (“TMI”) is the leading provider of mobile telecommunications services in
Denmark, the second-largest provider in Lithuania, the third-largest provider in Latvia and an MVNO in Germany
with a 4.3% market share. TMI’s activities include mobile voice telephony, sale of handsets, mobile data services as
well as wholesale services to MVNOs in Denmark, Lithuania and Austria. In Denmark, TMI provides mobile
telecommunications services through its domestic subsidiaries, TDC Mobil, a mobile network operator, and the
MVNO Telmore, which, offering mobile products online through a self-service website, represents a new business
model for us which we call the “Telmore Concept.”

Our international mobile businesses include the wholly-owned subsidiaries Talkline in Germany, which
owns an 80% stake in the easyMobile business in Germany, which is based on the Telmore Concept, and Bité, a
mobile network operator in Lithuania and Latvia. TMI also holds a 19.6% stake in Polkomtel, a Polish mobile
operator (which is in the process of being sold), and a 15% stake in the Austrian mobile operator, One. TMI also
holds 88.9% of the share capital of Telmore International, the subsidiary we established to conduct the
easyMobile business in the UK, and possibly in other European countries. We decided to discontinue our
easyMobile operations in The Netherlands in March 2006


-----

compared to 2004 in the domestic, German and Baltic markets (approximately 15%, 3% and 44%, respectively),
but TMI also experienced lower prices. In 2005, TMI had outgoing voice traffic volume of approximately 5.1
billion minutes, of which 2.4 billion outgoing minutes were generated in Denmark, an increase of 20% from
2004.

At year-end 2005, TMI had 7.4 million customers, an increase of 32.7% from 2004. Customer growth in
TMI in 2005 was driven by its international operations, with Talkline etc. having 844,000 more customers by
year-end 2005 representing an increase of 33% compared to year-end 2004, and Bité having 796,000 more
customers representing an increase of 86% compared to year-end 2004. At year-end 2005, TMI had 2,434 fulltime employee equivalents.

**TDC Mobile International** **TDC Mobile International Business Area**
**Revenue at year-end 2005** **Customers at year-end 2005**

Revenue from mobile telecommunications services primarily comes from voice traffic volumes, including
incoming and outgoing calls, international calls and international inbound and outbound roaming. TMI’s
residential customers are served with both post-paid and pre-paid products. Customers using our pre-paid
products pay an upfront fee for a set amount of services and receive a SIM card that can be replenished either
online or offline. The mobile network operators TDC Mobil and Bité, as well as the MVNO Telmore, gain
revenue from both incoming and outgoing traffic, whereas MVNO Talkline benefits from outgoing traffic only.

**_Domestic Operations (TDC Mobil and Telmore)_**

The domestic operations of TMI primarily include TDC Mobil and Telmore. In 2005, revenue from
domestic operations was DKK 7,151 million (€959 million), corresponding to 44.6% of TMI’s revenue,
compared with DKK 6,503 million (€872 million) in 2004. TDC Mobil is engaged in both retail activities,
including mobile voice and data transmission and the sale of handsets, and wholesale activities, such as selling
network access to MVNOs. In 2005, revenue from these areas was as follows: 47% from retail, of which 67%
came from mobile telephony, 18% from handsets and 14% from subscriptions, 52% from wholesale and 1% from
other activities. As noted above, Telmore sells mobile products and services to retail customers via self-service
websites. Transactions with our affiliates accounted for 49% of our wholesale revenue in 2005.

_Products and services_

_TDC Mobil._ TDC Mobil’s main post-paid product family is MobilExtra, a portfolio of mobile service
plans. This portfolio includes MobilExtra, MobilExtra 100 (minimum usage of DKK 100 (€13) per month),
MobilExtra 200 (minimum usage of DKK 200 (€27) per month) and MobilExtra 400 (minimum usage of
DKK 400 (€54) per month). Tariffs are charged for any additional minutes. The more expensive packages have
more favorable prices for minutes and higher handset subsidies. MobilTid, another one of our major mobile
products, is a pre-paid mobile service package, featuring a free subscription but higher traffic tariffs. MobilTid
users also have the added benefit of anonymity.

MobilFlexConnect is our main product in the business market and is targeted at companies with more
than 10 mobile subscriptions. With voice, SMS and data access, it links employees together through short
number codes MobilFlexLet is a web-based product marketed primarily to SoHos


-----

residential customers. At year-end 2005, TDC Mobil’s UMTS network had approximately 217 base stations and
covered 27% of the Danish population with commercial services, including the four largest cities in Denmark
and selected business areas. All TDC Mobil customers with 3G handsets or a mobile broadband card
automatically have access to the 3G network and any speed upgrades on the 3G network. Via a mobile broadband
card from TDC Mobil, our customers with a laptop PC can surf the internet via our 3G network with speeds up to
approximately seven times faster than what they are used to from the 2G mobile network. Our mobile customers
are typically charged for these services per megabyte downloaded.

Following the introduction of UMTS, data transmission prices halved and contributed to a doubling of
data traffic volumes from 2004 to 2005. The UMTS launch is expected to result in continued strong growth in
data traffic and increased revenue from TDC Mobil’s content services in the years ahead. Telmore also launched
UMTS services for its customers in the fourth quarter of 2005, using TDC Mobil’s UMTS network.

We launched FLY in 2004. FLY is a mobile phone portal offering information, services, entertainment
and games including video clips, music, emails and multiplayer games. Through the launch of the 3G network in
the fourth quarter of 2005, we have increased the speed for accessing these services significantly, which has
stimulated consumer use.

We believe further growth has been and will continue to be achieved by developing new services and
products. In 2005, the trend toward increased use of consumption-independent flat rate pricing for SMS messages
and voice traffic as offered by our competitors contributed to a decline in our share of the wholesale and retail
markets. In response, TDC Mobil launched the consumption-independent product MaxSMS and the
supplementary services Fri SMS and Fri Tale for MobilExtra subscribers, which have stimulated consumption. In
2005, MOU increased as a result of customers migrating from landline to mobile telephony. SMS and MMS
traffic also rose significantly.

TDC Mobil also offers its network services to MVNOs on a wholesale basis. Wholesale products consist
of voice, SMS and data transmission access, and the MVNOs carry out the sales, distribution, billing and
customer care effort to the ultimate customer. Our wholesale customers include a large number of independent
MVNOs, with Debitel being the largest.

_Telmore._ Through our Danish subsidiary, the MVNO Telmore, we sell our mobile products and services
online via self-service websites. Telmore is the current market leader in Denmark for the online mobile selfservice segment. More than one in every ten persons living in Denmark is a Telmore customer, and Telmore is
Denmark’s largest e-business company. In addition to relatively low prices, customers are offered a wide array of
mobile plan options such as automatic top-up, children’s budget and detailed call specification, which can be
selected in a very simple way online.

The Telmore Concept is essentially a simple and transparent pricing and self-service concept, based on no
subscription fees, a simple pre-paid tariff structure, and an easy to use web-based customer interface. The
concept focuses on lean operations, no high street shops and limited marketing budgets. At the end of 2005,
Telmore had 555,000 customers. Telmore’s customers contribute about one quarter of all Danish payments via
the internet by Dankort (the Danish debit card system).

_Customers, sales and distribution_

TDC Mobil sells its products and services to residential customers through TDC Shops, dealer shops,
websites, telemarketing and, since 2005, mass distribution channels such as supermarkets and large electronics
retail stores. Sales to business customers are carried out through TDC Mobil’s own sales force and through TDC
Solutions’ sales force, along with distribution through dealer shops.

TDC Mobil’s residential customer base is equally split between post-paid customers and pre-paid
SIM-card users. TDC Solutions’ convergence product Duét is targeted at the family segment. Telmore targets
internet users with a simple and customer friendly service offering.

TDC Mobil runs a premium pricing strategy for all customer segments relative to its main competitors.
The price premium is justified by reliability, good network quality and good customer service.

_Customer care_

Members of TDC Mobil’s customer care staff communicate with TDC Mobil’s customers through
inbound and outbound calling, SMS contacts and emails. TDC Mobil’s call center is the main department within
TDC Mobil responsible for customer service. The TDC Mobil call center handles orders, problem solving,
inquiries regarding invoices, number portability and technical support via telephone inquiries from TDC Mobil

features. Our customer care team participates in developing marketing strategy, marketing campaigns and our
go-to-market strategy. Presently, our customer service team is developing from a traditional cost center operation
to one focused on nurturing and expanding customer relationships, aiming to increase customer loyalty and
spending.

TDC Mobil’s customer service team focuses on providing our customers with assistance in a cost
efficient and effective manner. This includes directing non-value creating calls to our self-service portal on the
internet, implementation of an interactive voice response system focusing on premium service to the best
customers and automation of sales support activities.

_Competition in the Danish mobile market_

In 2003 and to some extent 2004, intense price competition was fuelled by Telmore and the other main
no-frills MVNO, CBB Mobil. However, consolidation in the Danish mobile market has reduced the pace of price
reductions in 2005.

In the market for residential customers, handset prices and traffic tariffs are important criteria for
customer preferences. In the mobile market, low-to-medium usage customers are targeted with low-priced
minutes and medium-to-high usage customers are targeted with semi-flat rates and full flat rates. TDC Mobil
offers handset subsidies to certain post-paid subscribers. In Denmark almost all mobile residential customers
have six month contracts, which is the maximum fixed subscription period permitted by regulation.

In the market for business customers, network quality and reliability and traffic tariffs are important
criteria for customer preferences. Free internal traffic within customers’ corporations is becoming increasingly
common. Additionally, the ability to offer pan-Nordic solutions is increasing in importance. TDC Mobil is
currently establishing a presence in Norway to meet this need. In both the residential customer market and the
business customer market, TDC Mobil maintains premium prices.

**_Talkline etc._**

Talkline etc. includes the MVNO Talkline in Germany, its 80% owned subsidiary easyMobile Germany
and the 88.9% of Telmore International that is owned by TMI. Revenue from Talkline etc. was approximately
DKK 7.7 billion (€1.0 billion) in 2005, corresponding to 48% of TMI’s revenue, compared to 51% in 2004.

_Talkline (Germany)_

Talkline is a MVNO and sells mobile service plans, handsets, pre-paid SIM cards and mobile
subscriptions in cooperation with mobile network providers in Germany. Talkline offers both UMTS and GSM
services. Talkline is the third largest German MVNO based on revenue. TMI owns 100% of Talkline which in
turn owns 80% of easyMobile Germany, an MVNO operating under its own brand name using T-Mobile’s
network.

As a result of strong growth in its customer base, Talkline increased market shares in 2005. At year-end
2005, the company had approximately 3.4 million mobile customers, up 31.3% from year-end 2004. The
expanded customer base is due mainly to Talkline’s success with its primary distribution channels in 2005.


-----

Talkline buys wholesale products, including minutes, SMS, MMS, 3G datacards, Blackberry service and
value-added services (such as mobile music and mobile TV) from the mobile network operators operating in
Germany, packages these into its own products, such as mobile tariffs and mobile plans, and sells these products
to retail customers. Talkline has agreements with T-Mobile, Vodafone and E-Plus for the use of their networks.
An agreement with the fourth and last mobile network operator O2, has been made and distribution of their
network services will be launched during the second quarter of 2006.

_Customer, sales and distribution_

Talkline’s sales channels include direct as well as indirect sales channels. Talkline is in the process of
opening Talkline brand stores in 94 German outlets of the largest German department store chain “Karstadt.”
Furthermore, numerous stores owned through a large Talkline dealer are branded Talkline stores.

Talkline also has sub-brands such as “unicomdirect” and “Tiefpreishandy.de,” an online shop. Also, the
company sells through indirect specialist dealers. Talkline has agreements with numerous mid-sized to major
retail chains that in total have several hundred distribution partners. Finally, cooperative relationships with
partners such as banks, automobile clubs, soccer clubs and automotive manufacturers have been implemented.

Through different sales channels including direct marketing channels and cooperation with well-known
brands such as soccer clubs, Talkline addresses certain customer segments that are not targeted by the mobile
network operators. Talkline operates on the basis of service delivery to its customers and strong sales
partnerships with its different sales channels. Talkline focuses on cost efficiency by utilizing self-service portals
for customer sales and services and electronic billing. A key strategic challenge for Talkline is competition for
sales channels given an increasingly saturated market.

_Subscription periods and handset subsidies_

In Germany, mobile service packages, including Talkline’s, generally include subsidized handsets. The
size of the subsidies depends on the value of the tariff which is combined with the handset. The duration of the
customer contracts are 24 months, allowing for the prepayment of the handset. For a mainstream handset of good
quality, the customer will pay up to €100 (DKK 746).

_Customer care_

Talkline focuses on retention and prevention activities and is very successful in identifying customers
with a high margin contribution and rewards these customers by offering special incentives.

At year-end 2005, Talkline had increased the number of customers receiving only electronic bills to more
than half of its contract customer base or 1 million, thereby realizing cost savings.

_Competition_

Competition in Germany is intensifying through declining prices triggered by no-frills players. The price
level in Germany saw an overall decrease in 2005 and this development is expected to continue through 2006.
Furthermore, flat fees for voice and data are increasingly common in the market.

We expect subsidies of handsets will continue and the availability of sales channels will remain a key
factor in growth. As the market matures, competition for existing customers will intensify and retaining
customers and preventing churn will increase in importance. Sale of 3G handsets will be important as a means to
increase usage and ARPU. However, the emergence of no-frills players who do not provide handsets and
typically offer lower tariffs might impact ARPU negatively, as high volume customers will have an incentive to
switch to no-frills providers.

In early 2006, T-Mobile and Vodafone launched subsidies of notebooks with an integrated UMTS module
with a SIM card slot. They have recently launched new mobile high speed data technology increasing download
bandwidth from 384 Kbps to 1.8 Mbps.

O2 has announced that they will move from a mobile company to an integrated telecommunications
company for mobile, fixed net and internet. O2 is expected to launch aggressive DSL pricing for bundled
products O2’s DSL product is based on the Telefonica’s IP-network


-----

Telmore International is the parent company of the easyMobile operations in the UK, which work closely
with easyMobile in Germany. TMI owns 88.9% of Telmore International and has an 80% stake in the German
business of easyMobile through Talkline.

In March 2005, we launched easyMobile UK, the first mobile operator under the easy brand, and in the
fourth quarter of 2005, easyMobile was launched in Germany and The Netherlands. Pursuant to an exclusive
brand license agreement with easyGroup of August 2004, we have the option of using the easy brand in a number
of additional European countries. However, due to disappointing sales in The Netherlands, we decided to close
the easyMobile operation in The Netherlands in March 2006.

The easyMobile companies provide mobile telephony following the Telmore Concept. As a supplement
to internet sales, easyMobile UK introduced off-net distribution offering bundled handsets and minutes in March
2006. easyMobile does not own its own network, but in the UK and Germany, it has concluded an MVNO
agreement with the mobile operator T-Mobile. At the end of 2005, easyMobile had 33,000 customers and
revenue of DKK 20 million (€3 million).

Some competitors have launched similar products in Germany and the UK. In the UK, the market for
internet-based services has proven to be smaller than expected. As this market develops, the total market share of
easyMobile is expected to increase.

**_Bité — Bité Lithuania and Bité Latvia_**

Bité is a mobile operator that is 100% owned by TMI, and operates in the Latvian and Lithuanian
markets. Bité Lithuania is the second-largest mobile operator in Lithuania with revenue of approximately DKK
1.1 billion (€148 million) in 2005. Bité Lithuania offers a wide range of mobile, internet content and data
services for business and residential customers and has its own network infrastructure, including GSM and
UMTS networks. Bité views the two countries as one market with a total population of 6 million people.

Bité’s revenue is generated primarily by mobile telephony. Bité generates 55% of its mobile revenue from
post-paid services and 17% from pre-paid services. The rest of its mobile revenue is generated from roaming,
sales of handsets and other activities.

Bité experienced a 44% increase in voice traffic in 2005 due to strong growth of 86% in its customer base
to 1.7 million customers. The growth rate primarily reflected an increased focus on the pre-paid segment and the
launch of SMS consumption-independent flat rate pricing for the pre-paid segment. However, this increase
should be seen in the context of declining retail prices and fewer average MOU per customer.

Bité provides a full range of mobile voice, data and internet services for the residential and business
markets in Lithuania and a full range of mobile communication services for residential users in the Latvian
market. Bité offers mobile internet access using its GSM network, which has been updated to 2.5 G using EDGE
technology and also offers landline internet access to business customers. In addition, Bité was the first mobile
operator in Lithuania to offer wholesale products to MVNOs. Bité’s main product in the Lithuanian residential
market is LABAS, a pre-paid mobile service package.

Bité has rolled out GSM 1800 and 900 networks in Lithuania and to a smaller extent in Latvia. In early
2005 an EDGE network in Lithuania was launched Bité was granted a UMTS license in Latvia in 2005 and in

the population is covered, whereas the population coverage in Latvia is approximately 63%.

**_Associates_**

_Polkomtel (Poland)_

TMI holds a 19.6% stake in Polkomtel, a leading Polish mobile operator in the business customer market,
with more than 9 million customers at year-end 2005 and a one-third share of the mobile market in Poland.

Pursuant to the change of control provisions in Polkomtel’s bylaws and the shareholder agreement among
Polkomtel’s shareholders, as a result of our recent change of control, TDC is required to offer to sell its 19.6%
ownership share to the other shareholders of Polkomtel. In February 2006 TDC offered its shares for a price of
€214.04 per share. On March 10, 2006, the Polish shareholders in Polkomtel entered into an agreement with TDC
whereby, subject to certain conditions including the outcome of the Vodafone litigation described below, they
agreed to exercise their right to purchase their pro rata share of 14.8% of the share capital of Polkomtel for an
aggregate price of €650.5 million. The remainder of TDC’s shareholding in Polkomtel, 4.8%, has been offered to
Vodafone, the only shareholder of Polkomtel who has not entered into the purchase agreement with TDC.
Vodafone has claimed that the offer procedure is invalid and that the offer price determined by TDC does not
reflect the market value of the Polkomtel shares. Vodafone also maintains that the price at which TDC’s shares in
Polkomtel should be offered for sale to Vodafone and the other shareholders should be determined in arbitration.
Legal proceedings are pending in the Polish Courts and the International Arbitral Center in Vienna. Upon
Vodafone’s motion, the District Court in Warsaw, Poland has issued an injunction, which prohibits TDC to
transfer any of its shares in Polkomtel. Vodafone has initiated arbitration against TDC. We believe that there is
no legal justification for the injunction and that the agreed price reflects the market value of the shares as of the
date of the agreement.

_One (Austria)_

TMI owns 15% of One, the third-largest mobile operator in Austria. Mobile phone penetration is 106% in
Austria and people in Austria are among the highest spenders in terms of mobile telecommunications in Europe.
In 2005, One’s customer base increased 15% to 1.8 million customers due partly to the successful launch of its
pre-paid no-frills concept Yesss!

In December 2003, One began a soft launch of UMTS services, which services include downloading of
music files and video telephony. A more comprehensive mass market launch was initiated in spring 2005. By the
end of 2005, the UMTS network covered 51% of Austria’s population. The UMTS roll out has until now been
concentrated on the most densely populated areas in Austria. We believe it is likely that further UMTS roll out
will be required to close coverage holes in already partially covered areas. Further, we expect One to establish
wireless hotspots in order to meet corporate customer needs.

**_TDC Cable TV_**

TDC Cable TV is the largest TV distributor in Denmark and it provides TV signals to approximately 40%
of all Danish households. TDC Cable TV offers TV programming, broadband services (cable modem) and IP
telephony.

In the past few years, TDC Cable TV has continued its growth in customer numbers, revenue and
margins. At year-end 2005, the number of cable TV customers was approximately 1 million, up 5% from
year-end 2004, and the number of customers with broadband rose 35% to 251,000. The number of telephony
customers was 9,900 at year-end 2005 (of which approximately 3,600 were VoIP customers). The TV customer
base grew at a CAGR of 5% in the period 2002-2005. In 2005, TDC Cable TV’s revenue was approximately
DKK 2.1 billion (€0.28 billion), an increase of 19% from 2004. By December 31, 2005, TDC Cable TV had
1,030 full-time employee equivalents.


-----

_Television_

TDC Cable TV’s core business is analog TV. TDC Cable TV currently offers analog TV in three standard
packages (basic, medium and full) to individual household customers and organized customers, representing 30%
and 70% of our business respectively. Organized customers include antenna co-operatives and housing
associations. Our analog TV transmissions do not require a receiver or set-top box. As a result, our customers can
view a different channel from each TV set in their residence. This gives us a competitive advantage over our
DTH competitors who can only provide single channel viewing for each set-top box employed.

The channels in the cable TV packages are selected with a view to customer preferences. TDC Cable
TV’s basic package, with approximately 170,000 customers, contains free channels from the state broadcasting
services. The medium package, with approximately 80,000 customers, contains some of the most popular pay
channels, including Viasat’s channels. The majority of our customers prefer the full package, which includes the
same channels as the medium package plus some foreign channels and has approximately 630,000 customers.
The current monthly list price for these packages is DKK 147 (€20), DKK 219 (€29) and DKK 290 (€39),
respectively (including VAT). Organized customers are subject to different monthly rates which are typically less
than the rates paid by individual household customers. Some organized customers, namely large antenna
co-operatives who represent an additional 150,000 households and housing associations are agency customers
who buy individually customized content packages from TDC Cable TV.

In 2006, we expect to begin the migration of the analog TV packages toward digital packages. Our entire
cable backbone network is digital. Approximately 4% of TDC Cable TV’s TV customers are digital customers
and therefore own or lease a digital set-top box, also known as the Selector. TDC Cable TV acquires the digital
set-top boxes from a third-party supplier, Sagem, and sells them to the customer at a discounted price. It is not
possible for Selector customers to use alternative set-top boxes than the ones supplied by TDC Cable TV, as
customized software is used. Selector customers choose either a medium or full package in digital format and can
supplement their package with a variety of further content packages, at prices in the range of approximately DKK
40-240 (€5-€32) per month. In addition, digital customers are offered Near Video On Demand services with pay
per view movies. In the second quarter of 2006, we expect to launch VoD and we plan to introduce a new and
improved set-top box with digital return path and HD capability in 2006.

_Broadband_

During the last five years, TDC Cable TV has invested in its cable network to make the majority of the
network broadband accessible (return path upgrade). At year-end 2005, TDC Cable TV had 251,000 broadband
customers, or 30% of the accessible customers. The broadband customer base has grown at a CAGR of 59% in
the period 2002-2005. TDC Cable TV’s broadband products are based on a flat rate concept, whereby the
customer is invoiced a fixed monthly subscription regardless of its IP-traffic consumption. Currently, broadband
speeds up to 4 Mbps are offered to customers.

TDC Cable TV expects to continue to grow its broadband activities. Our relatively strong position in the
broadband market has, to a large extent, been achieved through small changes in pricing and low-speed
connections of 256 Kbps or less. However, our large customer base and the unexploited capacity in the coaxial
network ensure that TDC Cable TV can easily adapt to future market trends.

_Telephony_

In 2005, TDC Cable TV launched a VoIP product offering. With the introduction of VoIP telephony,
TDC Cable TV can now offer its customers triple play solutions including TV, broadband and telephony. TDC
Cable TV offers high quality VoIP telephony with Quality of Service to ensure a clear and constant voice flow
similar to the voice flow in regular telephony. VoIP is offered as a pre-paid, flat rate, self-service product, where
ordering, management and payment are handled via a website.

**_Customers, Sales and Distribution_**

TDC Cable TV’s customer base consists of a combination of individual households and organized
customers (mainly antenna co-operatives and housing associations). Individual households have a direct
customer relationship with TDC Cable TV, whereas each organized customer handles matters such as billing
directly with the individual households it represents. It is common for organized customers to own and maintain
the last mile of the cable network. Broadband and VoIP products are almost entirely sold directly to the
individual household, regardless of whether the household is an individual customer or represented by an
organized customer


-----

a competitive advantage over the majority of our competitors who have only just begun to target the organized
customer market with broadband and telephony products. Once TDC Cable TV enters into a TV contract with an
organized customer for the provision of products or services, there is potential for sales of add-on products such
as digital TV, broadband and VoIP directly to each individual household represented by the organized customer.

**_Customer Care_**

TDC Cable TV bills its customers in advance of the billing period, thus contributing significantly to TDC
Cable TV’s cash flow and working capital. Under our cable service contracts, approximately 60% of our
organized customer base may terminate their subscriptions by giving two or more years notice, while individual
household customers are entitled to terminate the subscription by giving three months notice.

TDC Cable TV’s broadband and TV churn rates are relatively low. Annual broadband churn was 10.7%
(excluding churn due to change of address, including which broadband churn would be 14.8%) and annual TV
churn was 4.2% in 2005.

TDC Cable TV’s call center is the main sales channel for cable TV products. Our website is the main
sales channel for broadband and VoIP. The majority of incoming web orders require no manual handling due to
backend integration with our main IT systems. Finally, individual household customers, especially buyers of
set-top boxes, are served by TDC Shops and two external retail chains, which combined, cover all major cities in
Denmark. Retailers earn a commission on all sales. Organized customers are served through the organized
customer service. Individual household customers are primarily serviced through TDC Cable TV’s in-house call
center. Individual customers are also served through our website.

**_Content Providers_**

Historically, TV content prices have been relatively high in Denmark and TV distributors (both cable and
DTH) pay for most of their content other than content provided by the Nordic state owned broadcasting services.
TDC Cable TV’s most important suppliers are content providers such as TV2 (TV2 Zulu, TV2 Charlie and TV2
FILM), Viasat (TV 3, 3+ and Viasat Sport) and SBS (Kanal 5, The Voice TV and Canal Plus). We have strong
relationships with our largest content providers. Approximately 85% of total viewer ratings in Denmark are
domestic channels. We believe this fact and our large customer volume makes it crucial for Danish broadcasters
to have their channels included in our TV packages and gives TDC Cable TV strong bargaining power with
domestic content providers, which in turn lead to favorable discounts.

Our contracts with content providers typically run for two or three years. The fees we pay for content are
usually based upon subscriber numbers, although a few such contracts include minor scale discounts with
gradually declining fees per subscriber.

**_TDC Switzerland_**

TDC Switzerland offers mobile telephony, landline and internet services. In 2005, it acquired Ascom’s
communications solutions unit, renamed sunrise business communications, which has considerably strengthened
the provision of LAN products and services for TDC Switzerland’s business customers. TDC Switzerland’s
revenue was approximately DKK 9.6 billion (€1.3 billion) in 2005, a decrease of 1.1% from 2004.

TDC Switzerland has maintained its position as the second-largest telecommunications provider in the
Swiss market, a market characterized by fierce competition, decreasing mobile and fixed line prices and a
regulatory environment currently favorable to Swisscom. TDC Switzerland does not have its own access
network. Recently, the two Chambers of the Swiss Parliament agreed on legislation that would require Swisscom
to provide us with access to their local loop based on regulated prices. At year-end 2005, TDC Switzerland had
approximately 2.2 million customers. TDC Switzerland’s total customer base is relatively stable, with declining
traditional landline voice and dial-up services being partly offset by growth in mobile users and broadband.


-----

At year-end 2005, TDC Switzerland had 2,454 full-time employees, with 254 directly related to the
acquisition of sunrise business communications.

_TDC Switzerland Mobile_

Mobile telephony represents the major share of revenue in TDC Switzerland and was approximately
DKK 5.7 billion (€0.76 billion) in 2005. Mobile telephony contributed approximately 60% of TDC Switzerland’s
revenue in 2005. The number of mobile customers of TDC Switzerland at year-end 2005 was approximately
1.3 million, an increase of approximately 6.5% compared to 2004.

Our Swiss mobile business includes a retail and a wholesale section. Our Swiss retail business offers postpaid and pre-paid services as well as PC cards, and sells mobile handsets. By the end of 2005, approximately
50% of TDC Switzerland’s mobile subscriptions were pre-paid.

Our portfolio of retail mobile product service plans is called sunrise Relax. Our Relax plans are available
for both post-paid and pre-paid customers. The customer is billed per call (up to one hour) for on-net mobile calls
and calls to fixed net. Off-net mobile calls and international calls are billed at a per minute rate. Relax consists of
four different price packages suited to different usage levels. In addition to Relax, we offer six subscription
packages tailored for post-paid customers, who have a relatively constant usage pattern. Each of these
subscriptions include a certain amount of voice and/or SMS minutes, for example, the subscription product
“sunrise minute 60” with a monthly subscription that includes 60 minutes per month. The pricing for each
product depends on the monthly minimum MOU the user expects to consume.

In order to compete with the no-frills packages offered by our competitors, TDC Switzerland has
launched the brand yallo. Yallo offers simple and transparent pricing and no subscriptions along the lines of the
Telmore Concept. Initially launched as an online-only offer, TDC Switzerland now sells yallo through our direct
and indirect distribution channels.

TDC Switzerland also offers a wide portfolio of value-added services and data services, such as sunrise
live portal, which includes music downloads, games and video telephony. In 2005, TDC Switzerland launched a
UMTS/EDGE network and our outdoor population coverage at the end of 2005 for GSM/GPRS was 99%, for
EDGE 78% and for UMTS 57%.

TDC Switzerland also offers bundled mobile, fixed line and broadband products, which enable customers
to take advantage of discounts by purchasing both mobile and fixed voice or voice and internet from TDC
Switzerland.

In the mobile wholesale area, we currently have agreements with companies such as Cablecom and Tele2.

_Landline telephony_

Revenue from landline telephony in TDC Switzerland was approximately DKK 3.1 billion (€0.4 billion)
in 2005. Landline telephony contributed 32.1% of revenue of TDC Switzerland in 2005, compared with 32.4% in
2004. At the end of 2005, TDC Switzerland had 527,000 landline customers.

Our landline telephony business in Switzerland covers retail and wholesale markets. Retail voice includes
pre-fix and pre-select PSTN plans, with or without a contract, as well as VoIP. The main family of PSTN price
plans is called “Sunrise Select,” and includes a choice of a charge by the minute plan, a charge by the call plan or
a plan with included minutes. Sunrise Select plans also offer additional options like discounted international calls
or discounted calls within a user group. Business customers also benefit from data solutions such as IP-VPN and
leased lines and, as of July 1, 2005, network integration solutions which combine voice and data in one network


-----

traffic and, to a smaller extent, data and internet services.

TDC Switzerland offers twelve month customer contracts with fixed numbers of minutes included or
fixed hourly rates for a flat fee or with telephone service bundled with other services, such as mobile or DSL. For
international calls, special contracts offering fixed low prices are in place. We face the challenge of managing an
effective transition from PSTN to VoIP, without losing customers and without having the cost of maintaining two
technologies in parallel for too long.

_Internet services_

In 2005, the internet services business contributed approximately DKK 792 million (€106 million) of
revenue, or approximately 8.3% of the revenue of TDC Switzerland. The broadband penetration rate was 48% at
the end of 2005. At the end of June 2005, TDC had an 11% market share in the broadband segment and a 28%
market share in the dial-up segment. TDC Switzerland had 204,000 dial-up and 182,416 DSL customers at
year-end 2005.

TDC Switzerland’s internet services business offers dial-up and three different DSL products. ADSL plus
is a flat rate product with up to 5 Mbps downstream charged at a flat fee. In 2005, TDC Switzerland introduced
ADSL Flex, which was the first consumption-based DSL product in Switzerland. For this product, the customer
pays a subscription fee which covers a certain amount of megabytes and additional usage is billed per megabyte.
In 2006, we introduced ADSL Free which is purely consumption-based.

The growing broadband market in Switzerland is the driver for the continuous DSL customer growth of
TDC Switzerland. As access to the local loop on a regulated basis has not yet been introduced in Switzerland, we
currently resell Swisscom’s DSL products with small gross margins and little room for product differentiation
other than through pricing. We expect to have ULL access by 2007 and, as a result, we expect margins to grow.
Churn in the DSL business is low, but is expected to grow once the market becomes more saturated.

The dial-up internet access business is declining and is expected to be entirely substituted by broadband
services within the next few years. TDC Switzerland is currently focusing its DSL acquisition programs on
migrating its dial-up customers to one of the sunrise DSL products.

**_Customers, sales and distribution_**

TDC Switzerland divides its business customers into three segments. The corporate segment consists of
approximately 1,500 companies that each have more than 200 employees. In the SME segment the market
consists of approximately 17,000 companies that each have 20-200 employees. Finally, in the SoHo segment, the
market consists of approximately 279,000 companies that each have up to 19 employees.

Our Swiss marketing activities are organized in two units, one of which is focused on wireline (voice and
internet) and the other on mobile. We have approximately 150 full-time employees in total in the two units. Each
unit has dedicated teams for the residential and business customer markets. The activities within these units cover
marketing communications, product management and development, segment management and customer
relationship management, process management and market intelligence, as well as new business partner
management.

The sales organization for residential customers has approximately 200 full-time employees and focuses
primarily on our own shops, and the management of external partners and sales channels. The remuneration of
external partners and sales channels is primarily based on sales commissions. The sales organization for business
customers has approximately 200 full-time employees. Commission-based incentives are an integrated part of
remuneration of both our own sales force and external sales channels. See section “— Distribution” below.

_Advertising._ TDC Switzerland follows a single brand advertising strategy which is a cornerstone in its
efforts to become a convergent service provider. An exception to our single brand strategy is yallo. Yallo was
launched last year to compete with the no-frills and low price mobile offers that are entering the Swiss market.

TDC Switzerland’s marketing team utilizes a variety of medias to advertise our products. Our style of the
advertising aims to be humorous and informative. All campaigns are however supported by a call to action in the
form of an attractive product offer

concert organizer, is used as a platform to retain customers and create loyalty. The music sponsoring is also an
integral part of sunrise’s online music offering “Music World.”

In the business market, the communication is more targeted. Segment specific communication channels
such as trade journals or trade fairs are used.

All communication activities to new and existing customers are based on segmentation. For targeted
cross- and up-selling to existing customers segmentation is used on a one-to-one basis (e.g. segment specific
direct marketing activities, such as bill inserts and direct mailings.)

Within our telephony and internet operations, this year’s business marketing focus is to significantly
increase brand awareness and position the sunrise brand to become number one in VoIP in the Swiss business
market. For the first time in Switzerland, this marketing strategy is supported by a dedicated testimonial
campaign targeting key decision makers on TV and in the business press in collaboration with Cisco and Nortel
featuring CEOs of recognized Swiss companies that are satisfied users of our services.

In addition to mobile and fixed line carrier services, we market, design, build and maintain complete
business telephony and data solutions to enterprises in various industry branches including financial services,
healthcare, logistics and transportation through our newly acquired sunrise business communications division.

For the corporate and SME segments, our marketing efforts tend to be customized for each buyer,
including dedicated account management, customer specific presentations and local events.

We use innovative marketing approaches such as door opener campaigns to target select customer groups.
As part of our communication efforts, we advertise in the professional and general press, publish our own
business magazine and e-newsletter, participate in major business events and sponsor the Swiss football league
and major classical and pop concerts.

_Distribution._ Distribution of our products and services is through our own direct sales organization as
well as via selected distribution partners. Distribution for the residential segment focuses on internal channels
(our shop network, e-shop and direct sales through customer care) and external channels. We own 23 sunrise
shops and operate 16 shops inside supermarkets. One third of the post-paid activations and about half of the
contract extensions are generated through our own sales channels.

For external channels, we use both specialized and non-specialized channels. Specialized channels
include Mobile Zone and Phone House, which include chains that sell mobile subscriptions for all three major
mobile operators in Switzerland. Non-specialized channels include Fust and Interdiscount which are major
electronics dealers in Switzerland, and Migros which is the largest retail chain in Switzerland. Remuneration of
external sales channels is based on a basic commission per customer and certain bonuses.

In selling to customers, we distinguish between pull channels, where the customer initiates contact, and
push channels, where we contact the customer. The pull channels include TDC Switzerland’s call center
(inbound calls), sunrise branded shops and the sunrise online shop and retail chains. The push channels include
door sales (outsourced to door-to-door organizations), TDC Switzerland, call center (outbound calls) and three
external Swiss-based call centers.

To serve our business customers, we use internal and external channels. A regional direct sales force is
the most important channel in the corporate segment, whereas the SME segment is served both through our own
direct sales force as well as partners. In the residential segment and the SoHo segment we primarily use external
partners, as described above.

For all segments and channels, there is a strong focus on cross-selling wireline products to TDC
Switzerland mobile customers and vice-versa.

The sunrise brand is used both in the residential and business segments. The marketing of residential
wireless services focuses on voice and internet access services. We focus on net growth by substantially
increasing our footprint in the SME and SoHo segments through sales of mass market capable standard solutions
and broadband and application services.

TDC Switzerland is positioning itself in the business market with best value for money offerings for the
SoHo and SME segments


-----

A primary focus of customer care is customer life cycle management, including sales, retention, billing
enquiries and technical support. Customer care is a low cost acquisition and retention channel, and the customer
loyalty generated by this channel is higher than other channels.

The customer care organization manages all of TDC Switzerland’s customer relationships. There are four
physical locations across Switzerland which support four languages (German, French, Italian and English). The
front office number of full-time employee equivalents is approximately 440 and the back office number of fulltime employee equivalents is approximately 140. Technical support is open twenty four hours a day whereas
opening hours for billing inquiries and other information is shorter.

**_Competition_**

_Fixed Line_

The total market for landline voice traffic in Switzerland declined in 2005 primarily due to migration
from landline to mobile telephony. As voice products typically consist only of a choice of price plans, there is
little room for differentiation between our products and those of our competitors beyond price.

TDC Switzerland’s fixed line business, initially successful with a market share of over 20% in 2002, has
experienced a decline in market share to 15%, as a result of a lack of regulation and competition from new
operators such as Cablecom. However, the anticipated introduction of ULL is expected to put TDC Switzerland
in a position to offer better prices and product offerings. TDC Switzerland is also well prepared for future
challenges such as VoIP, as we have already introduced our own VoIP solution. Swisscom benefits from the lack
of regulation and in 2005 was able to maintain its market share of 60% in fixed line. However, Swisscom’s
customer base is decreasing as a result of fixed-to-mobile substitution. Tele2, which had a market share of 14%
in 2005 in fixed line, is increasingly pressured as its price leadership strategy is being challenged by Cablecom.

Cablecom had a market share of 6.2% in fixed line at the end of 2005. Cablecom can offer cheaper prices
than resellers, as the company owns the cable network direct to households. However, Cablecom only had a
market share of 61% in the Swiss cable market in 2005, as there are approximately 250 other regional cable
providers, however, most of these do not offer telephony products.

_Broadband_

TDC Switzerland is continuing to migrate its dial-up customer base to DSL. TDC Switzerland’s broadband
market share was approximately 11% in 2005. We expect to grow the market share with VoIP and ULL. Swisscom
had a market share of 42% in 2005, and announced that it expects to launch TVoIP in 2006 and introduce triple play
services to compete with the Cablecom threat. Tele2’s DSL offering mainly targets residential customers and
competes on the basis of pricing. Its broadband market share was below 10% at the end of 2005.

Cablecom offers higher bandwidth than Swisscom DSL and uses aggressive pricing and promotions.
Cablecom has a triple play strategy and is the predominant provider of digital TV in Switzerland. While
Cablecom can challenge Swisscom because Cablecom is not suffering from lack of last mile regulation,
Cablecom does not have access to the whole Swiss population. Cablecom’s market share for broadband was
21.3% at the end of 2005.

_Mobile_

TDC Switzerland has a stable market position with 19% market share at the end of 2005 and, after
decreasing the prices of Relax in 2006, TDC Switzerland became the price leader in the pre-paid and post-paid
segment.

In 2005, the first MVNOs and resellers entered the Swiss market. Migros uses the Swisscom network and
Coop uses the Orange network. Tele2 has its own GSM network in the Zurich region, and in addition has a
roaming agreement with TDC Switzerland. Cablecom has an MVNO agreement with TDC Switzerland. We
expect intense price competition as a result of the entrance of these players in the Swiss mobile market.

In the post-paid segment, Swisscom is positioning itself as an innovative leader by offering advanced
content and HSDPA. Swisscom’s mobile market share was 63% at the end of 2005, while Orange had a market
share of 18% in 2005.

With the brand yallo, TDC Switzerland is offering a no-frills product, similar to M-Budget and Coop
Mobile. Approximately 49.7% of TDC Switzerland’s customer base is in the pre-paid segment. In 2005,
Swisscom was able to grow its customer base in the pre-paid segment with M-Budget, which is challenging TDC
Switzerland’s low price strategy. Like Swisscom, Orange was able to grow its customer base in 2005 within the
pre-paid segment with Coop Mobile, which is offering the same prices as M-Budget and is based on the same
concept.

We operate the most extensive telecommunications network in Denmark. Our telecommunications
backbone network has high-capacity transmission capabilities and is fully digitalized. Our access network
reaches almost 100% of Denmark’s population. We operate our own networks in Switzerland, the Nordic region,
Lithuania, Latvia and Hungary. We own and operate a backbone network in the Nordic region, which is one of
Europe’s fastest broadband networks for data, internet and voice traffic. We believe our past investments,
particularly in Danish network infrastructure, will allow us to lower our operating costs and lower capital
expenditures in the future.

**_Our Landline Network_**

Our Danish landline network is a fully developed modern telecommunications network covering almost
100% of the Danish population. The landline network includes a fully invested PSTN/ISDN network, an MPLS
capable IP backbone network and DSL coverage of approximately 98% of potential customers at 512 Kbps
downstream speed, which is high compared to the European average of approximately 94%. Our DSL network,
which we consider to be one of the most advanced in Europe, can deliver 4 Mbps and 8 Mbps to 90% and 55%,
respectively, of the Danish population. We expect to be able to deliver 8 Mbps DSL service to 85% of the Danish
population by the end of 2006.

_Transport Network._ In Denmark, a key element of our landline network is a fiber-based transport
network. The transport network is used for PSTN/ISDN services and data services (IP, Ethernet and ATM). It is
also used by TDC Mobil and TDC Cable TV. The transport network in Denmark consists of:

Š 19,205 kilometers of fiber cable, which connect all of our central offices to the fiber transport network
and all 1,347 of our nodes,

Š DSLAM equipment in all of our central offices and nodes,

Š wavelength division multiplex systems to increase capacity per fiber, and

Š a leased line platform delivering fixed capacity connection speeds with bandwidths up to 2 Mbps in
Denmark.

_Fixed Access Network._ TDC Solutions’ fixed access network, or PSTN/ISDN network, consists of
twisted copper pairs and optical fiber. The PSTN/ISDN network in Denmark covers 100% of the population and
is used to deliver both basic and advanced telephony services. This network consists of:

Š 228,000 kilometers of twisted copper pair cable in Denmark that connect 2.43 million PSTN and
0.33 million ISDN2 customers,

Š 4,319 kilometers of optical fiber cable in Denmark that connect 3,145 customers, and

Š 149 central offices (including 120 local exchanges, 10 transit exchanges, 2 international exchanges, 8
IN service contact points, 2 speech servers, 2 servers for directory assistance and 5 exchanges for
testing purposes).

The PSTN customer base is declining in Denmark, which has been creating free capacity on our PSTN/
ISDN network. As a consequence, we expect that the need for investment in the PSTN/ISDN network in the
future will be limited. We have a high port utilization in our DSLAM equipment for DSL and IP because we
employ a just-in-time port build-out. As a result, the current customer take-up cannot be sustained without
investing in additional port capacity. We increase our customer capacity by cost-effectively increasing the port
capacity of the existing DSLAM equipment.

_The Data Networks._ Our data networks in Denmark and the Nordic region include our ATM and IP
networks. The ATM network (only in Denmark) is the platform for aggregated DSL-based broadband access
services. The ATM network also delivers a range of data connection services including frame relay and ATM
services. The ATM network covers Denmark with 137 POPs.

The IP network consists of an MPLS-based IP core network, IP EDGE networks and IP aggregation
networks. The IP network delivers internet access services, pan-Nordic MPLS-based IP-VPN services, VoIP
services and content services such as TVoIP. MPLS plays a key role in delivering the necessary Quality of
Service for VoIP. Routers are a key component of the reliability of the MPLS-based IP core network, as each
POP is supported by two routers in order to prevent interruptions in the flow of traffic on the network. The
separated IP cores in the Nordic countries are currently being integrated to a unified Nordic IP core


-----

extends to 154 POPs in Denmark and TDC Song extends that network to a further 295 POPs. The IP aggregation
networks include DSL networks providing DSL and SHDSL based services and IP/Ethernet networks providing
100 Mbps and 11 Gbps Ethernet access services to the IP network. Our IP network extends to 1,582 DSL POPs
with 691,000 customers in Denmark and TDC Song extends that network to a further 578 DSL POPs with 13,500
IP-VPN customers and 34,300 internet access customers. We also have 650 wireless hotspots throughout
Denmark.

Due to expected traffic growth, the traffic capacity limits on the ATM DSLAM platform may be reached
on certain parts of the network. As a result, in 2006, we plan to start to roll out a new IP/Ethernet network, and
install new DSLAMs for DSL services in all central offices and nodes connected to the local copper loop. The
new network will make it possible to improve high speed DSL coverage using remote DSLAMs. The
introduction of remote DSLAMs is currently in the planning phase. We believe that we will achieve cost savings
by moving from an ATM to an Ethernet based network.

We designed our network to be compatible with the network equipment and platforms of multiple
vendors. With the exception of the ATM platform, we have a dual vendor strategy, which makes us less
dependent on one vendor for key supplies, repairs and upgrades. By moving from ATM to Ethernet technology
for DSL services, we aim to decrease our dependency on specific ATM vendors.

_Pan-Nordic Network (TDC Song)._ TDC Song’s network consists of a fiber-based transport network, as
well as a PSTN/ISDN network and, as discussed above, IP/Ethernet network. TDC Song’s PSTN/ISDN network
is primarily used to serve business and wholesale customers. TDC Song’s long-haul transport network consists of
approximately 19,000 kilometers of fiber cable and a pan-Nordic Synchronous Digital Hierarchy network
delivering fixed point-to-point capacity of up to 10 Gbps. TDC Song’s fixed access network (MAN) consists of
2,325 kilometers of optical fiber cable that connects fiber directly to 4,630 customers. Apart from customers that
we connect directly to our fiber network, TDC Song relies on DSL over unbundled copper to provide local
access. The coverage of the Nordic network primarily covers the cities and larger towns in Sweden, Norway and
Finland. Currently, there are 635 central offices connected to the TDC Song network of which 375 are located in
Sweden, 110 in Norway and 150 in Finland. In 2005, we began to offer DSL services to residential customers in
Sweden at a bandwidth of either 1Mbps, 8Mbps or 28Mbps. In 2006, we will continue to integrate TDC
Solutions’ existing network in the Nordic region with the network of TDC Song. The TDC Song network also
consists of wavelength division multiplex systems to increase capacity per fiber.

The following table shows the location of our ULL central offices and the residential and business DSL
coverage that our network has.

_TDC Carrier Services._ Under the name TDC Carrier Services, TDC operates extensive transport and IP
networks outside the Nordic region. The international transport network includes 75,000 kilometers of fiber
connections covering Eastern and Central Europe, with submarine extensions to the United States.

**_Our Mobile Network_**

_GSM Network._ TDC Mobil has rolled out GSM 1800 and 900 networks in Denmark. The number of
GSM base stations in Denmark is approximately 1,840. In Denmark, close to 100% of the population and
geography is covered. The utilization of the network has increased by 30% over the last three years. According to
industry surveys conducted by a prominent Danish telecommunications research company, 76% of all business
telecommunications customers and 86% of our customers in Denmark believe TDC Mobil has the best GSM
network in Denmark and that our network quality is better than or on par with competitors.

Nokia and Ericsson provided the hardware and software for TDC Mobil’s GSM radio network. The core
network consists of 15 mobile and software switching centers and 6 home location registers that were
manufactured by Ericsson. Our GSM network consists of approximately 4,400 GSM 900-cells and 2,850 GSM
1800-cells and 40 base station controllers.

TDC Mobil’s network includes platforms for voicemail, SMS, Wireless Application Protocol, MMS, a
platform for content delivery, and the mobile portal FLY and an Intelligent Network platform for a large number
of services, including pre-paid services. We have bundled our mobile broadband access offer with the TDC
wireless hotspots, of which we have 650 in airports, hotels, conference centers, cafés and Statoil petrol stations
and rest areas along the main transport roads across Denmark.


-----

population coverage at a speed of 12.4 Kbps by 2008, with a geographic coverage of approximately 13%. We
will upgrade network speed in accordance with customer demand and cater for special customer needs for
coverage through a focused VIP-program. We plan to upgrade 12% of the base stations in our 3G network to
higher bit rates using HSDPA technology at the end of 2007, and to make a further HSDPA roll out according to
market needs from 2008.

**_Our Cable Network_**

TDC Cable TV has a fully digitalized network. It is operated from one central super-head-end in
Copenhagen that serves as play-out for the entire network. This super-head-end also serves as a basis for TDC
Solutions’ TVoDSL and central VoD servers, and has the capacity to supply TV to hand-sets (DVB-H and 3G).
Moreover, the super-head-end provides cable modem provisioning and network management control servers for
IP-products. TV is transmitted digitally by TDC Solutions’ domestic backbone network to 47 remote hubs, from
where the three standard packages are converted to analog transmission. Additional channels are transmitted
digitally and the customer is required to have a set-top box to receive these channels. From the hubs to the
households, transmission is distributed by a HFC network, the majority of which is owned by TDC Cable TV. The
last few hundred meters of customer premise cable network, however, is frequently owned by landlords or
organized customers. In total, TDC Cable TV’s network covers almost 50% of Danish households.

As with TV transmission, IP traffic terminates via TDC Solutions’ IP backbone to the same 47 hubs,
partly by lines leased from TDC Solutions. The network owned by TDC Cable TV is almost completely returnpath upgraded. Approximately two-thirds of customer-owned network is upgraded by TDC Cable TV. The
coaxial cable offers vast capacity, which is presently only marginally exploited. All modems are Docsis 1.1 and
are ready for Docsis 2.0. However, TDC Cable TV is contemplating a complete Docsis 3.0 roll out, which would
enable up to 100 Mbps end user connections throughout the network.

**_Our Swiss Network_**

TDC Switzerland has built and operates its own mobile, fixed and ISP networks. As a result, TDC
Switzerland offers integrated services and is able to meet the high market demand for quality and reliability of
and easy access to telecommunications services. Due to recent legislation requiring Swisscom to provide us with
access to its ULL network, we expect that we will be able to obtain direct access to additional end users in
Switzerland.

_Mobile Network_

Despite difficult topographical circumstances and stringent environmental obligations, especially in the
non-ionizing radiations area, which limits radiation from mobile antennas, sunrise has achieved competitive
coverage and quality with the GSM network. In addition, sunrise is further developing and expanding its mobile
network based on EDGE and UMTS technology. TDC Switzerland’s main coverage objective for its UMTS
network is to achieve 384 Kbps indoor service in major cities such as Zurich, Basel, Bern, Lausanne, Geneva,
Luzern, Chur and Lugano, and then to enlarge the 128/384 Kbps service to greater urban areas. TDC Switzerland
Mobile had 2,200 GSM/GPRS sites, 800 EDGE sites and 470 UMTS sites as of year-end 2005.

_Fixed Network_

TDC Switzerland’s fixed network consists of a SDH/DWDM backbone (our own fiber-optic network
measuring more than 7,000 kilometers), 1,608 connected sites and direct interconnection with all interconnect
points of the Swiss incumbent operator and several international carriers.

_ISP Network_

The TDC Switzerland ISP network is fully redundant with two independent sites and provides a range of
internet services.

**_Network Operation_**

Routine maintenance, inspections and tests are conducted on a daily basis including tests of network
performance. The performance of our network is monitored separately for each of our technologies. In addition,
TDC constantly monitors all network events through one common alarm handling system at the Network
Operations Center in Copenhagen TDC is presently implementing a new network alarm system which will


-----

system can also be initiated by our customers. Triggering the network alarm system initiates fault handling and
maintenance procedures, which might include on-site maintenance.

As part of our maintenance operations, TDC has entered into service and support agreements with
technology vendors. These agreements normally involve escalation procedures on system faults. The procedures
could be initiated as part of the daily fault handling or as part of the performance monitoring of the networks.
Our service and support agreements also include provisions for the service and repair of spare parts. We also
have agreements with local companies for on-site repair and spare parts handling.

TDC Switzerland’s central network operations center monitors the entire TDC Switzerland network 24
hours a day and performs fault management procedures. TDC Switzerland has a field crew that operates in 11
locations and performs first line maintenance, preventive maintenance and implementation of site safety and
security.

**Billing, Information Technology and Procurement**

**_TDC Services_**

In general, our subsidiary, TDC Services, is responsible for billing, IT and procurement services for the
majority of our domestic operations, including TDC, TDC Solutions, TDC Mobil and TDC Cable TV. TDC
Services is also responsible for a number of operational tasks for these domestic operations, including logistics,
facilities management and management of accounts payable. Our international operations, as well as certain of
our domestic operations (e.g. Telmore and Song Denmark), generally handle their own billing and IT. However,
in the future, TDC Services will start to provide selected services to our Nordic and other European operations.
Although TDC Services mainly supports our internal operations, TDC Services provides limited services to thirdparty customers and generated revenue of approximately DKK 106 million (€13 million) in 2005 from the
provision of such services. As discussed in more detail below, TDC Services is also responsible for handling
certain of our procurement task requirements across Europe.

**_Billing_**

_TDC Services._ TDC Services is responsible for all domestic billing activities, as well as reminder
procedures (except for TMI), billing complaints and debt collection. Billing is the most frequent and closest
encounter we have with our customers. By proactively developing our billing processes and ensuring that the
bills are delivered in the correct frequency, layout and language, we aim to ensure high satisfaction and loyalty
among our customers.

TDC Services produces and distributes approximately 18 million invoices and call specifications
annually. Most customers receive quarterly invoices. Electronic billing is a particular focus area, as it can
simultaneously improve customer satisfaction and reduce administrative costs. TDC Services has started
increasing the number of bills distributed electronically and has introduced various electronic billing solutions. In
the fourth quarter of 2005, 3.6% of all bills were distributed electronically. Our strategic goal is to increase this
percentage substantially and realize associated cost savings.

In the second half of 2006, TDC Mobil and TDC Solutions expect to implement a new customer exposure
system, which will monitor credit and fraud risks. On a daily basis, the system will monitor all customers of TDC
Solutions and TDC Mobil for changes in usage and payment behaviour with the purpose of automatically
generating alerts if the aforementioned changes break predefined limits. The alerts will be investigated and, if
necessary, actions will be taken to reduce our exposure to customer credit risk. TDC intends to investigate
whether the customer exposure system should be implemented for our other business lines.

_TDC Switzerland._ TDC Switzerland produces and distributes approximately one million invoices
monthly, 93% to residential customers and 7% to business and wholesale customers and dealers. All services can
be included on one invoice. The main payment methods are “over the counter” payments at bank branches or
post offices. To a lesser extent, bills are paid by means of e-banking and transfers. TDC Switzerland has
launched electronic billing and payment for its residential customers.

**_IT Solutions_**

Our IT services unit works with our internal business units and at times with our customers to deliver IT
projects.

In order to minimize our total IT costs and increase our efficiency, we outsource certain IT tasks. In
recent years, the maintenance, development and operation of several IT activities have been outsourced, in part
utilizing off-shore resources


-----

Š operation, maintenance and development of certain legacy systems in June 2003 to CSC, including
Tandem and IBM OS/390 mainframe platforms;

Š development of TDC Mobil’s self-service applications in January 2005 to Capgemini;

Š support and desktop management in January 2005 to CSC; and

Š development and maintenance of enterprise resource planning applications in June 2005 to IBM.

**_Procurement across Europe_**

TDC Services is responsible for attending to our procurement needs across Europe. Within TDC Services,
the corporate procurement department is responsible for conducting negotiations with our suppliers with a view
to using our buying power to obtain favorable prices and terms. For example, the corporate procurement
department renegotiated contracts relating to EDGE and 3G equipment for all of our business lines and not each
division individually, leveraging our buying power and leading to cost savings of approximately DKK
100 million (€13 million) in 2005 and more than DKK 800 million (€107 million) in the contract period. It also
aims to hire people with significant experience in procurement and provides inhouse procurement training. TDC
Services also focuses on strengthening cooperation between our European operations in order to consolidate our
procurement activities.

**_Research and Development_**

Our research and development activities are currently focused on developing next-generation services and
network platforms in the landline and mobile business areas. This includes development of broadband
applications and services, as well as IP-based and UMTS network platforms and wireless LAN capabilities.
Furthermore, we participate in international programs, including standardization efforts, and cooperate with
independent research organizations. Although we expect our research and development efforts to contribute to
future revenue growth, we believe our results of operations and cash flows are not dependent upon the success of
such efforts.

**_Intellectual Property_**

In August 2004, TDC signed an exclusive license agreement with easyGroup, which allows us to use the
easy brand when offering mobile telephony in up to 11 European countries. At present we have operations in the
UK and in Germany using the easy brand. However, the operations are still at a very early stage in their
development. See “Business — Talkline etc.”

Apart from our leading brands, we do not believe that we are dependent on any other intellectual property
right including any individual brands.

**_Property, Plant and Equipment_**

TDC Services manages the majority our office premises and floor space in Denmark. However, certain of
our Danish operations, such as Telmore, manage their own premises. We believe we have sufficient leased space
and real property to conduct our business activities effectively.

Our principal properties consist of numerous telecommunications installations, including exchanges of
various sizes, transmission equipment, cable networks, base stations for mobile networks and equipment for
radio communication, the majority of which are located in Denmark. We also have numerous computer
installations, which are primarily located in Copenhagen and Aarhus.

The total area of our domestic properties was approximately 972,000 gross square meters as of
December 31, 2005, of which approximately 60% was owned by us and approximately 40% was leased. As of
December 31, 2005, telecommunication installations (exchanges and base stations) represented 38% of our total
property plant and equipment and other installations represented 4% of our total property plant and equipment

In 2005, the new Zurich headquarters of TDC Switzerland, the sunrise Tower, opened and we relocated a
majority of TDC Switzerland’s staff to the headquarters. As a result, certain of our other office spaces are
currently empty. Efforts are underway to sublet or assign these empty office spaces.

The main office buildings in Switzerland are:

**_Employees_**

**_Overview_**

We place a high priority on training our employees. We have established an extensive management training
program. Approximately 200 of our managers participate in this program. We believe that the management training
program has enhanced the skill base of our managers. As a result, even as the skills we need to operate our business
evolve, in 2005 we have been able to recruit 75% of all candidates for managerial positions internally and to retain
approximately 90% of the existing managers. In addition, we have an incentivized salary system. Approximately
2,500 managers and specialists participate in our bonus plan. In addition, approximately 550 sales employees get
paid on a commission basis.

We monitor employee satisfaction each year by conducting an employee survey. After receiving the
results of the survey, we engage in dialogue with our employees to identify ways to improve the work
environment for our staff.

We have recently begun to reduce our domestic workforce. Customers are switching from traditional
landline telephony to mobile and IP-based broadband solutions, which are less labor intensive than traditional
landline telephony.


-----

through our redundancy programs and partly from attrition. In 2004, 494 employees were covered by the
redundancy programs and 630 employees in 2005. In 2005, we reduced the number of domestic full-time
employees from 14,437 to 13,876. However, our domestic workforce reduction has been offset by the addition of
employees in our international operations as a result of our international acquisition activity and our recruitment
of new employees with sought after skills. At year-end 2005, we had 20,225 full-time employee equivalents
compared with 19,497 in 2004. The after-tax cost related to the redundancy programs was DKK 410 million (€55
million) in 2004 and DKK 320 million (€43 million) in 2005. We plan to reduce the domestic workforce by
approximately 720 full-time employees in 2006, of which we expect 150 to terminate their employment through
natural attrition or internal replacements. We plan to carry out our redundancy programs with respect to up to
570 employees through voluntary resignations in accordance with our agreements with certain unions involving
voluntary termination, as described below in “Business—Unions.” The total costs related to workforce reductions
in 2006 are estimated at DKK 342 million (€46 million) after tax.

**_Unions_**

We estimate that more than 70% of our employees are members of unions. We believe that we have a
good relationship with our unions.

We have in place collective labor agreements with the telecommunications department of the Danish
Metal Workers Union (Dansk Metal) (“DMWU”), the Association of Managers and Employees in Special
Positions of Trust in TDC (Lederforeningen i TDC, LTD) (“AME”), the Danish Confederation of Professional
Associations (AC-organisationerne) (“DC”), 3F and Radiotelegrafistforeningen. Our agreement with AME
prohibits striking and other industrial actions.

We have entered into “Borgfredsaftaler,” collective agreements, with each of DMWU, AME and DC
(collectively, the “Borgfredsaftale unions”). In these Borgfredsaftaler we have agreed to follow certain
procedural guidelines in connection with the implementation of reductions in our workforce including providing
redundant employees with training that would make them suitable for reassignment within TDC in certain
circumstances. Pursuant to our Borgfredsaftale with DMWU, the parties have agreed to enter into dialogue
within 24 hours of an imminent conflict in order to prevent industrial action. The Borgfredsaftaler expire at the
end of 2007, however they may be terminated by us or the unions subject to three months notice in the event the
assumptions behind the agreements lapse or change.

We also have entered into collective agreements with the Borgfredsaftale unions regarding the terms and
conditions of voluntary resignations by employees as an incentive to encourage voluntary resignations. These
agreements may be terminated by either party subject to two months notice.

**_Pension schemes_**

Our workforce consists of (i) former civil servants covered by defined benefit plans, (ii) employees with
pension rights in TDC-related pension funds (which are defined benefit plans) and (iii) employees with ordinary
pension plans (which are defined contribution plans)


-----

retained their right to a civil service pension in accordance with the Danish Act on Pensions to Civil Servants.
Our employees who are former civil servants also retain their right to special severance pay in the amount of
three years’ salary (Rådighedsløn) in the event of dismissal due to insufficient workload (stillingsnedlæggelse).
The pension is paid by the Danish state pursuant to an agreement with the Danish State in 1994.

The pension terms of the members of the TDC-related pension funds are also similar to those provided by
the Danish Civil Servants Plan. However, some of these employees have a right to special severance pay in the
amount of three years’ salary (Rådighedsløn) or three months full salary and four years and nine months and two
thirds of a month salary (Ventepenge).

The number of employees that participated in each of our pension plans as of March 15, 2006 is given

**_Employment agreements_**

Pursuant to their employment agreements with us, in the event of a change of control of us, and for a
period of 24 months thereafter, certain of our top managers have a right to a prolonged notice period from us,
ranging from 24 months to 36 months. For the same period after a change of control, any proposal for a
deterioration of the managers’ position or responsibilities may be considered a notice of dismissal from
the company.

**_Legal Proceedings_**

The TDC Group is a party to certain pending lawsuits and cases pending with public authorities and
complaint boards.

TDC’s stake in Polkomtel is currently being disposed of and certain legal proceedings are pending in
relation to this disposal, as described in “— TDC Mobile International — Associates — Polkomtel (Poland).”

At the EGM held on February 28, 2006, the Purchaser proposed that TDC seek to delist its shares and
ADSs from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and from the NYSE, respectively, and subsequently seek to
deregister all securities from the U.S. Exchange Act. The Purchaser also proposed the introduction of a new
clause into the articles of association of TDC permitting the compulsory acquisition of the shares of minority
shareholders. These proposals attained an affirmative vote of over 90% of the share capital of TDC represented at
the EGM (although less than 90% of the share capital of TDC) and such resolutions were declared passed by the
EGM. Subsequently, the DCCA ruled that it would not register the new articles of association. Further, ATP, a
Danish pension fund holding 5.5% of the shares in TDC, has filed a writ with the Copenhagen City Court (which
has been passed on to the Eastern High Court) against both TDC and the Purchaser seeking an acknowledgment
of the invalidity of both the squeeze-out provisions in the articles of association and the authorization to delist
from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and the NYSE granted at the EGM. On April 5, TDC and the Purchaser
announced that they would challenge the DCCA’s ruling in the Danish courts. TDC has proceeded with its
intention to delist its ADSs from the NYSE, which delisting occurred on April 19, 2006. If ATP succeeds in its
litigation, we will be unable to proceed with the compulsory acquisition. In addition, ATP may seek an award of
damages against us or other relief. In the legal proceedings instigated by ATP against the Purchaser and TDC,
ATP has reserved the right to challenge authorizations proposed for adoption at the annual general meeting of
TDC on April 26, 2006, as illegal, in particular authorizations (i) to issue warrants to management and others and
(ii) to repurchase shares. Furthermore, ATP claims that the reference date with regard to the redemption price of
ATP’s shares should only be decided as of when the redemption may actually be completed. Finally, ATP claims
that the Purchaser should pay interest on the redemption price. TDC and the Purchaser have not yet responded to
these claims by ATP.

**_European Union_**

In March 2002, the EU passed a number of directives designed to promote competition in the European
telecommunications market that were subsequently implemented into Danish law in 2003. In accordance with
this legislation, NITA performs market analyses on 18 specifically defined submarkets with respect to landline
telephony, mobile telephony, leased lines, unbundled access, broadband and television and radio transmission. In
a particular submarket NITA may designate a dominant telecommunications operator as having Significant
Market Power (“SMP”) in the relevant submarket. If imperfections in the relevant submarkets are identified,
NITA may impose remedies against the operator having SMP in order to promote competition. In the wholesale
market, such measures may include the acceptance of a reasonable request for interconnection, nondiscrimination, reference offers, transparency, accounting separation, specific cost accounting obligations and
price control methods. NITA has so far issued decisions on fourteen out of eighteen submarkets. Final decisions
for all the submarkets, except the submarket for television and radio transmission, are expected during the first
half of 2006. Until market analyses of the relevant submarkets have been completed and NITA has decided
whether to adopt new regulative measures or revoke former measures, the current regulation will be maintained
in each relevant submarket.

**_Denmark_**

_SMP Designation_

We have been designated as having SMP by NITA in almost all of the submarkets in Denmark, except for
Market 15 (the wholesale market for mobile access) and Markets 5 and 6 (the retail markets for national traffic
and international traffic for business customers, respectively). As a result of our SMP designation, we are subject
to additional regulatory burdens, which are summarized below. In addition, NITA has been considering whether
to create an additional submarket for cable TV networks. If NITA creates a cable TV submarket, it is likely we
would be designated as having SMP in the cable TV submarket and might be required to provide third parties
with access to our cable network. There can be no assurance that NITA will not impose additional regulatory
burdens on us as a result of our current SMP status or designate us as having SMP in additional markets.

_Retail markets._

As a result of our SMP status, the larger part of our retail offerings of leased lines must comply with a
rule of cost orientation. As a result, we are required to calibrate leased-line prices annually to ensure that they
exactly match the corresponding cost plus a mark-up set by NITA.

_Wholesale markets._

In the wholesale markets in which we have SMP status, the majority of our prices are regulated as a result
of our SMP designation. Until 2002, interconnection prices were regulated mainly on the basis of historical cost
analyses and best-practice benchmarking against corresponding international prices. Since January 1, 2003,
NITA has set the prices we charge for switched interconnection traffic, interconnection capacity, shared access
and ULL (also known as raw copper) as well as related co-location. NITA calculates these prices once a year in
accordance with the LRAIC model and evaluates and updates the LRAIC model once every three years. Only
minor price adjustments were implemented in 2004 and 2005. In early 2006, the LRAIC model was adjusted and
the prices for ULL, switched interconnection traffic and interconnection capacity were decreased considerably.
The prices for TDC’s other interconnection products are based on historical costs according to a formula set by
NITA. Furthermore, the telecommunications law was amended with effect from January 1, 2006, resulting in
changes in calculation principles for depreciation, amortization and interest payments. The amended law also
gives NITA increased power to stipulate specific terms and conditions for TDC’s interconnection agreements.

NITA’s decision on the submarket for broadband access requires us to discontinue our geographical
differentiation of bitstream access prices unless we also differentiate our retail prices for broadband.
Discontinuation of geographical differentiation of prices for bitstream access will strengthen our competitors in
remote areas, where production of bitstream access is very costly for us. Alternatively, we may decide to let the
current differentiation of wholesale prices affect our end user prices. The decision also requires us to offer
wholesale broadband solutions (bitstream access) without compulsory landline subscriptions, which will improve
our competitors’ conditions for offering broadband solutions combined with IP telephony. We have appealed the
decision for this market and some of the other decisions to the Telecommunications Complaints Board.

The authorities have announced that they intend to intervene in the pricing of traditional landline
subscriptions for customers who also have broadband subscriptions in order to address the so-called “excess cost
recovery problem” The formulation of such intervention is uncertain


-----

However, price regulation has been introduced only for TDC, Sonofon and TeliaSonera whose average price
(including call set-up fee) must be reduced by approximately 35% over the next two years.

On October 31, 2005, NITA concluded that TDC abuses its dominant position in Denmark by requesting
wholesale customers to pre-pay certain quarterly charges for certain wholesale products, and to require these
customers to provide guarantees for their contractual obligations. We believe that we have not abused our
dominant position, and have appealed NITA’s decision to the Danish Competition Appeal Tribunal, where the
matter is currently pending. Based on the ruling by the NITA, Tele2 has filed a claim for payment of damages,
which the court has postponed until the summer of 2006, when the Competition Appeal Tribunal is expected to
conclude our appeal to the NITA decision. Based on a legal assessment of the possible outcome of Tele2’s claim,
as well as the other lawsuits and cases that are currently pending, management is of the opinion that these will
have no significant adverse effect on TDC Group’s financial position.

Decisions have also been made on four retail submarkets for telephony traffic, the retail market for leased
lines, the wholesale markets for fixed connections, unbundled access and shared use including co-locations, as
well as for fixed termination. None of the decisions include significant changes in relation to existing regulation
with the exception of regulations relating to extended access related to co-location and extended requirements to
guarantee the line quality against disturbances.

_Anti-terror measures._

As part of the anti-terrorism action plan passed by the Danish government in November 2005, the
government has proposed a bill requiring telecommunications operators to use or install communication
interception equipment and to establish databases for mandatory retention of traffic passing through their
networks in order to assist law enforcement agencies in tracking terrorist activity. If such measures are adopted,
we may have to make additional investments on technical equipment and we may incur operational costs as a
result.

_EU Universal Service Obligation (USO) directive._

Pursuant to the EU USO directive and Danish USO regulation, which are designed to ensure that all end
users have access to certain basic telecommunications services regardless of their geographical location at an
affordable price NITA has designated us as the Universal Service Provider (USP) in Denmark. In the past NITA
fixed the prices that we could charge to our Danish customers who use PSTN Services (“USO customers”) for
PSTN services, but these price caps were lifted at the end of 2005.

_EU Roaming Charge Regulation._

The EU Commission is currently considering new regulations designed to decrease international roaming
charges. It is unclear what would be the outcome of the regulation if imposed.

**_Switzerland_**

_Regulations_

Prompted by a preliminary decision by the Swiss competition authority regarding abuse of market power
by Swisscom, the Swiss incumbent, in 2005, Swisscom reduced its prices for terminating mobile calls, putting
heavy pressure on other Swiss mobile operators, including TDC Switzerland, to reduce their tariffs as well. The
Swiss competition authority is continuing its review of the level of competition in the mobile call termination
market and is currently investigating whether the Swiss mobile operators, including TDC Switzerland, have a
dominant position and, if so, abuse such position. Consequently, TDC Switzerland faces the possibility that the
Swiss competition authority will require Swisscom and/or TDC Switzerland to make further price reductions for
terminating mobile calls. Such price reductions, if imposed on TDC Switzerland, may have a material adverse
effect on the earning and profit margins of our Swiss operations. In addition, there can be no assurance that the
Swiss competition authority will not impose a material fine upon TDC Switzerland if the Swiss competition
authority determines that TDC Switzerland has a dominant position in the mobile call termination market and has
abused such position.

Swisscom announced on April 10, 2006 that it had received a draft ruling from the Swiss competition
authority recommending that it pay a CHF 489 million (€310 million) fine for misuse of mobile termination
rates. Swisscom reported that the competition authority considered that all Swiss mobile carriers had a monopoly
on incoming calls within their network, but only Swisscom Mobile misused its dominant position on the market
in the period between April 1, 2004 to May 31, 2005 by demanding excessively high termination fees. Swisscom
reported that the investigation into the period following the reduction of fees is to be continued and will also
cover the other Swiss mobile carriers, including TDC Switzerland. Swisscom has said it will argue against the
ruling


-----

the interconnection tariffs as set by ComCom in court. In the second half of 2006, the Federal Supreme Court in
Switzerland is expected to issue a final ruling on the matter. If Swisscom’s appeal is sustained and their higher
interconnection rates are confirmed by the Federal Supreme Court, TDC Switzerland may have to pay higher than
expected prices to use Swisscom’s landline network.

Our business plan and earnings forecasts, particularly in relation to expected broadband and triple play
sales, anticipate that the Swiss legislature will enact legislation requiring Swiss telecommunications operators to
open their ULL networks to other operators. Such regulations would allow TDC Switzerland to lease network
capacity on Swisscom’s ULL and gain access to Swisscom’s customers. A revised telecommunications law
providing for such opening of ULL networks was passed by the Swiss Parliament on March 24, 2006. A 100-day
referendum period expires on July 13, 2006. If there is no referendum and the ordinances implementing the new
law are finalized, the new law enters into force. Although unlikely, it is possible that organizations opposed to
the law could force a public vote, which would further delay enactments by at least a year and could potentially
result in enactment being prevented.

**_Licenses - Denmark and Switzerland_**

We are licensed by NITA to provide mobile telecommunications services in Denmark and by the Swiss
regulator to provide mobile telecommunications services in Switzerland. For example, we have UMTS licenses to
provide 3G services in Denmark and Switzerland, three GSM licenses in Denmark (including licenses for
DCS1800, DC56 and GSM) and one GSM license in Switzerland. Our Danish and Swiss UMTS licenses are valid
until October 31, 2021 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our Danish GSM licenses are valid until June 12,
2007, January 1, 2011 and March 1, 2012, respectively, and our Swiss GSM license is valid until May 31, 2008.
There can be no assurance that NITA or the Swiss regulator will not withdraw our existing licenses if we can not
meet license conditions, including obtaining the regulator’s consent in the event of a change of control. After their
respective expiration dates, we will have to reapply for a new Danish UMTS license and new Swiss GSM and
UMTS licenses. There can be no assurance that any application for renewal of such licenses will be successful. The
three Danish GSM licenses will be extended automatically for periods of 10 years unless NITA, at its discretion,
issues a decision not to extend such licenses which decision must be made one year before the scheduled expiry
date.

Š the performance of the internal audit function and oversight of the performance of the independent
registered public accounting firm.

The Board of Directors now effectively fulfills these functions.

**Aggregate Compensation of Directors and Officers**

In 2005, compensation to the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee amounted to DKK
9 million (€1.3 million) and DKK 22 million (€2.9 million), respectively, aggregating DKK 31 million (€4.2
million). The compensation to the Board of Directors included special compensation to the Board of Directors of


-----

extraordinary workload in connection with the Acquisition.

Performance based bonuses have been paid to the Executive Committee and are included in the above
amount. Approximately 300 top managers participate in a bonus program called the Top Managers’
Compensation Program, and approximately 2,200 managers and specialists participate in a bonus program called
the Managers’ Compensation Program.

The bonus programs are based on specific, individual annual targets, including personal, financial and
operational targets. These targets depend on the individual employee’s organizational position within TDC and
are weighted in accordance with specific rules. All targets must support improved profitability and business
development at TDC.

Bonus payments are calculated as the individual employee’s basic salary times the bonus percentage
times the degree of target fulfillment. The bonus percentage achieved when targets are met is called the on-target
bonus percentage. For the Top Managers’ Compensation Program, this percentage is fixed in the contract of
employment with the individual employee and usually varies within a range of 10-25%. The on-target bonus
percentage is somewhat lower for the Managers’ Compensation Program. The bonus could be a maximum of
200% of the on-target bonus.

The bonus program for the members of the Executive Committee is based on the same principles as those
for other managers.

In 2005, 52,040 options to purchase our shares were granted to members of the Executive Committee at
an average exercise price of DKK 292 (€39.1) per share. This brought the total number of outstanding options
held by members of the Executive Committee to 340,742 with an average exercise price of DKK 298 (€39.9) per
share. One third of the options vest annually and consequently each grant vests fully in three years. Share options
may, however, be exercised in the event of change of control of TDC whether they are vested or unvested. The
options expire 10 years after the date of grant. In connection with the Tender Offer and conditional on the
completion thereof, TDC gave the members of the Executive Committee an offer to exercise existing share
options and offered to buy certain existing share options. The members of the Executive Committee accepted
both offers for all their share options. Consequently, they currently do not hold any share options. Since 2003,
members of the Board of Directors have not received share options.

**Employment Agreements for Members of the Executive Committee**

The contracts of the members of the Executive Committee provide for notice periods of 12-18 months in
the event of termination by TDC; the employment agreement of the Chief Executive Officer cannot be
terminated by TDC before March 31, 2008. In the event of a change of control of TDC, and for a period of 24
months thereafter, members of the Executive Committee are entitled to a prolonged termination notice of 36
months with full rights to salary and pensions, as well as compensation for benefits, bonuses and share options.
The members of the Executive Committee also have the right to voluntarily terminate their employment in a
period between three and six months following the first change of control of TDC after November 30, 2005
(which occurred in connection with the completion of the Tender Offer) and receive the benefits of the prolonged
termination period.

**Share Purchase and Option Plans**

TDC had a revolving share-option program for employees in TDC’s Danish enterprises until the
Purchaser acquired control of TDC. TDC’s revolving share-option program covered about 200 managers
employed in Denmark and stationed in TDC’s foreign enterprises. After the earnings release for the year was
published, share options were granted to participants in accordance with contracts of employment. The number of
options was based on an agreed percentage of the employee’s basic salary and a calculated price per option
(number of options = basic salary times option percentage divided by price per option). The option percentage
varied for the different employees within a range of 20-35%. In addition, share options were granted on an
individual basis in special cases. The price per option to be used only to calculate the number of options to be
granted was calculated at the time of granting using the Black-Scholes formula. The exercise price of each option
was determined as TDC’s share price on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange on the day of granting.

In connection with the Tender Offer, TDC gave participants in TDC’s revolving share-option program an
opportunity to exercise their options and offered to buy certain existing share options. The offers were accepted
by most option holders, including the members of the Executive Committee. For share-option holders who did
not accept the offers the share options granted before 2005—in total 201 065—continue unchanged


-----

options. The offers were accepted by most option holders. If employees did not accept either offer, their share
options lapsed.

The share-option program has now been discontinued. The TDC Board of Directors has proposed that the
annual general meeting to be held on April 26, 2006 authorize the Board of Directors, without any preemption
rights for the shareholders of TDC, to issue warrants to managers of TDC or its subsidiaries and the chairman
and vice-chairman of TDC entitling the holders to subscribe for TDC shares for a nominal value of up to
DKK 49,593,790 (€6,647,623), and to implement the capital increases relating to the warrants. However, no
decision has yet been taken as to the form of any option program at TDC or elsewhere. ATP has announced that
it may challenge the resolution to authorize the grant of such warrants on the basis that these may be used by the
Purchaser to complete a squeeze-out of TDC’s minority shareholders.

**Subscription and Shareholders Agreement**

The Investors, the Equity Investors, Nordic Telephone Company Investment ApS, Nordic Telephone
Company Administration ApS, Nordic Telephone Company Finance ApS, the Issuer and the Purchaser have
entered into a subscription and shareholders agreement. For details on the subscription and shareholders
agreement, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions — The Shareholders Agreement.”


-----

(1) The equity interests in Nordic Telephone Company Investment ApS are indirectly owned by the
Consortium and by certain co-investors. The Consortium consists of investment funds and entities
advised or managed, directly or indirectly by the Investors. The Investors and the Equity Investors have
entered into a subscription and shareholders agreement. For details on the subscription and shareholders
agreement and certain other co-investors, see “Certain Relationships and Related Party Transactions —
The Shareholders Agreement.”
(2) TDC has borrowed €6,506 million under the Senior Credit Facilities, including the €4,765 million
borrowed in connection with the Debt Pushdown. The Senior Credit Facilities are guaranteed by the
Issuer and secured by a first-ranking pledge over the shares of the Purchaser and will also be secured by
first-ranking security over certain assets of TDC and its subsidiaries. See “Description of Other
Indebtedness — Senior Credit Facilities.” The Revolving Credit Facility in the amount of €700 million
included in the Senior Credit Facilities may be drawn by the Issuer for, among other things, the service of
interest under the notes and Bridge Facility, until January 30, 2008. It may also be drawn by TDC until
December 31, 2012.
(3) Amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility will be discharged with the proceeds of the notes. An
additional €269 million will be available under the Bridge Facility until May 30, 2006. The Bridge
Facility is secured by a second-ranking pledge of the shares of the Purchaser, ranking equally with the
pledge securing the notes.
(4) The notes will have the benefit of security in the form of a second-priority pledge of 100% of the shares
of the Purchaser, ranking equally with the pledge securing the Bridge Facility.
(5) Approximately 0.3% of the tendered shares were owned by TDC employees and must be returned if the
compulsory acquisition does not occur. If the Purchaser returns these shares, it will own 87.9% of the
share capital of TDC.


-----

_The Tender Offer._ On February 1, 2006, the Purchaser acquired approximately 88.2% of the outstanding
share capital of TDC. The share capital was acquired pursuant to the Tender Offer, combined with open market
purchases made at the same time by the Purchaser, for all TDC Shares and all TDC ADSs, each representing one
half of one TDC Share, at a price of DKK 382 (€51) per TDC Share and DKK 191 (€25.50) per TDC ADS.

_The Debt Tender and Redemption._ In conjunction with the Tender Offer, the Issuer invited the holders
of certain series of TDC’s EMTNs, excluding a series of notes due on April 24, 2006, to offer to sell such
EMTNs to the Issuer or another entity designated by the Issuer. In March 2006, TDC assumed the Issuer’s
obligations in respect of the Invitations and acquired or redeemed €1,770 million of the EMTNs pursuant to the
Invitations, leaving €1,284 million of the EMTNs (excluding the EMTNs due in April 2006) outstanding. On
April 24, 2006, TDC will redeem the €685 million of EMTNs due on that date with cash and amounts drawn
under the Senior Credit Facilities. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

_Financings._ In connection with the Tender Offer, the Purchaser received a cash equity contribution of
DKK 16.4 billion (€2,197 million) and the Issuer entered into the Senior Credit Facilities and the Bridge Facility.
TDC has acceded to the Senior Credit Facilities as a borrower and a guarantor. The Senior Credit Facilities
include the Term A Facility drawn in an amount of €1,576 million, the Term B Facility drawn in an amount of
€2,465 million and the Term C Facility drawn in an amount of €2,465 million, each used, among other things, to
finance the Tender Offer, the Debt Tender and the Redemption, refinance indebtedness, pay fees and fund the
Debt Pushdown. The Senior Credit Facilities also include the Revolving Credit Facility of up to €700 million, the
proceeds of which may be used to, among other things, finance our working capital requirements and capital
expenditures and finance the payment of interest on the indebtedness of the Issuer.

The Bridge Facility consists of a term loan facility drawn in an amount of €2,031 million. The proceeds
from the issuance of the notes will be used to repay the amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility. Following
this repayment, approximately €269 million will be available under the Bridge Facility until May 30, 2006. The
Senior Credit Facilities permit us under certain circumstances to apply asset sale proceeds to repay any amounts
under the Bridge Facility. The Bridge Facility contains certain negative undertakings and covenants that are
substantially similar to those under the Senior Credit Facilities. After the offering is completed, the Bridge
Facility covenants will be conformed to be substantially similar to those included in the notes. “Use of
Proceeds,” “Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

_Extraordinary General Meeting._ At the EGM held on February 28, 2006, the Purchaser elected new
board members and proposed that TDC seek to delist its shares and ADSs from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange
and from the NYSE, respectively, and subsequently seek to deregister all securities registered under the U.S.
Exchange Act. The Purchaser also proposed the introduction of a new clause into the articles of association of
TDC permitting the compulsory acquisition of the shares of minority shareholders. These proposals attained an
affirmative vote of over 90% of the share capital of TDC represented at the EGM and such resolutions were
declared passed by the EGM. Subsequently, the DCCA ruled that it would not register the new articles of
association. Further, ATP, a Danish pension fund holding 5.5% of the shares in TDC, has filed a writ with the
Copenhagen City Court (which has been passed on to the Eastern High Court) against both TDC and the
Purchaser seeking an acknowledgment of the invalidity of both the squeeze-out provisions in the articles of
association and the authorization to delist from the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and the NYSE granted at the
EGM. On April 5, TDC and the Purchaser announced that they would challenge the DCCA’s ruling in the Danish
courts. TDC has proceeded with its intention to delist its ADSs from the NYSE, which delisting occurred on
April 19, 2006. If ATP succeeds in its litigation, we will be unable to proceed with the compulsory acquisition.

_Debt Pushdown._ On April 11, 2006, the amounts originally drawn by the Issuer under the Senior Credit
Facilities were repaid with amounts received by the Purchaser from TDC by way of extraordinary dividend (and
in turn paid to the Issuer by way of dividend). To finance part of this dividend (together with a pro rata dividend
paid to remaining minority shareholders in TDC), TDC drew down €4,765 million under the Senior Credit
Facilities.

transfers are restricted to certain affiliates, subsidiaries, controlling parties, syndicatees, transfers permitted by
certain financing documents and transfers approved by the Investors. Any transfer to any person who is primarily

transfers, shall be subject to the right of each other Investor to make an offer to purchase such equity securities
on the same terms.

which remains available under Term A Facility until July 30, 2006 for the purpose of financing the payment of
principal and accrued interest in respect of the purchase and redemption of any EMTNs.

As of the closing of this offering, TDC will have drawn amounts under Term A Facility, Term B Facility

Š to finance the redemption of EMTNs pursuant to the Invitations;

Š to finance the redemption of the remaining 2010 EMTNs and the 2011 EMTNs;

Š to finance the redemption of the TDC EMTNs due on April 24, 2006; and

Š to finance dividend payments pursuant to the Debt Pushdown referred to below.

The Revolving Credit Facility is available to TDC and any of its subsidiaries which may accede to the
Senior Facilities Agreement as an additional borrower for financing the working capital requirements and the
general corporate purpose of the TDC group. The Revolving Credit Facility is also available to the Issuer until
January 30, 2008 for the purpose of, among other things, financing interest payments due under the notes.

The Cash Bridge Facility A and Cash Bridge Facility B have been repaid or, as the case may be, cancelled
in full.

**_Debt Pushdown_**

Certain of the facilities originally available under the Senior Facilities Agreement were drawn by the
Issuer and applied towards financing the consideration payable for the Tender Offer (including the payment of


-----

dividend). The dividend paid to the Purchaser was partly financed with amounts drawn under the Senior Credit
Facilities by TDC.

**_Ancillary facilities_**

An ancillary facility is a funding facility ancillary to the Senior Credit Facilities that can be drawn upon
by the borrower by way of (i) an overdraft or other current account facility; (ii) a guarantee, bonding,
documentary or stand-by letter of credit facility; (iii) a short-term loan facility; (iv) a derivatives facility; (v) a
foreign exchange facility or any other borrower; or (vi) certain other facilities or accommodations required in
connection with the business of the Group. The Issuer and a Lender may agree bilaterally for the Lender to
provide to a borrower all or part of such Lender’s unutilized commitment under the Revolving Credit Facility, by
way of ancillary facilities, subject to certain conditions and up to a maximum aggregate amount equal to €500
million.

**_Repayment_**

Any amounts drawn down under Term Facility A must be repaid in installments by making a payment of
a minimum stipulated amount on each repayment date for Term Facility A. Any amount of Term Facility A still
outstanding on the termination date will be due in full immediately on that date. The last scheduled repayment
date of Term Facility A is December 31, 2011.

Any amounts drawn down under the remaining Term Facilities (Term Facility B and Term Facility C)
must be repaid in full on their respective termination dates. Term Facility B and Term Facility C terminate on
December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2014, respectively.

Any amount drawn down under the Revolving Credit Facility (other than any revolving capex loan drawn
under the Revolving Capex Facility) must be repaid on the last day of the applicable Interest Period. Any
revolving capex loans drawn under the Revolving Capex Facility must be repaid in installments by making a
payment of a minimum stipulated amount on each repayment date for revolving capex loans. Any amount under
the Revolving Credit Facility still outstanding on the termination date will be due in full immediately on that
date. Any amounts repaid under the Revolving Credit Facility (other than any revolving capex loan drawn under
the Revolving Capex Facility) may be re-borrowed unless the termination date for the Revolving Credit Facility
has been reached. The Revolving Credit Facility terminates on December 31, 2012.

**_Interest rates_**

The interest rate on each Loan under the Senior Credit Facilities for each Interest Period is the percentage
rate per annum, which is equal to the aggregate of the applicable (a) Margin (as set forth below), (b) the
appropriate IBOR and (c) any Mandatory Cost. Subject to certain exceptions, interest accrues daily from and
including the first day of any Interest Period and is payable on the last day of each Interest Period.

The Margins for Term A Facility, Term B Facility, Term C Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility are
2.125%, 2.375%, 2.875% and 2.125%, respectively. From January 30, 2007, there is a margin adjustment
mechanism in relation to the Margin applicable to Term A Facility, Term B Facility and the Revolving Credit
Facility. This is triggered in the event that the last four quarterly consolidated management accounts (or, as the
case may be, the annual audited accounts) of the Group delivered to the Facility Agent show that, for the 12
month period ending on the date of the most recently delivered quarterly financial statements (or, as the case may
be, the annual audited accounts), the ratio of the Consolidated Total Net Debt to Consolidated EBITDA is below
certain thresholds set forth in the Senior Credit Facilities.

**_Security for the Senior Credit Facilities_**

The Issuer has provided a guarantee and direct security for its own obligations and for obligations of other
obligors under the Senior Facilities Agreement by a first ranking pledge over its shares of the Purchaser in favor
of the Security Agent. The Issuer may be required to provide further security over certain of its assets in favor of
the Security Agent. TDC has provided, and certain of its subsidiaries will provide, a guarantee in respect of
obligations of the Group under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Certain of those guarantors will provide first
ranking security over certain of their respective assets in support of such guarantee.

**_Undertakings_**

The Senior Credit Facilities contain certain negative undertakings that, subject to certain customary and
other agreed exceptions, limit the ability of the Group to, among other things:

Š enter into any amalgamations demergers mergers consolidation or corporate reconstruction;


-----

Š acquire a company or acquire (or acquire an interest in) shares or equity securities or a business or
undertaking;

Š enter into a joint venture;

Š incur or allow to remain outstanding further debt obligations or permit to subsist any security over any
assets or enter into other arrangements which would create a quasi-security interest;

Š sell, lease, transfer or otherwise dispose of any asset;

Š enter into any transaction with any Connected Person (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement)
except on arm’s length terms;

Š make any loans or grant any credits;

Š give any guarantee or indemnity in respect of any person;

Š declare, make or pay any dividends or make any distribution or pay any other amounts in respect of or
redeem our share capital or pay a fee to a Connected Person; and

Š issue share capital.

The Senior Facilities Agreement also requires the Group to observe certain affirmative undertakings
subject to materiality and other customary and agreed exceptions. These affirmative undertakings, include, but
are not limited to, undertakings related to (i) obtaining and renewing all necessary consents, filings and
authorizations; (ii) insurance; (iii) taxes; (iv) intellectual property rights; (v) corporate existence and obtaining all
required consents or otherwise complying with all applicable laws and regulations relevant to the business;
(vi) pari passu ranking of all payment obligations under the Senior Credit Facilities documentation with other
unsecured unsubordinated payment obligations; (vii) compliance with the relevant laws, rules and regulations
relating to the environment; and (viii) the maintenance of and funding of pension schemes.

**_Financial covenants_**

The financial covenants under the Senior Facilities Agreement require, among other things:

Š maintenance of a minimum ratio of Consolidated Cashflow to Net Debt Service of 1.00:1;

The Senior Facilities Agreement contains an “Equity Cure” provision that allows us to cure a failure to
comply with any of the ratio requirements referred to above (but not a failure to comply with the restriction on
annual aggregate Capital Expenditure) by raising cash by means of a share subscription or a shareholder loan.

**_Prepayments_**

A borrower may prepay all or part of any loans made under the Term Facilities or any revolving capex
loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility, in whole or in part, provided that the Facility Agent has received
not less than three business days’ prior notice and any partial payment is in a minimum base currency amount of
€10 million. The Issuer may select which loans the prepayment is to be applied to and to what extent.

A borrower may prepay any Revolving Loan made under the Revolving Credit Facility, in whole or in
part, provided that the Facility Agent has received not less than three business days’ prior notice and any partial
payment is in a minimum base currency amount of €5 million.


-----

together with interest or any other fees accrued will be required.

If Excess Cashflow of the Group exceeds €30 million at the end of any financial year commencing after
December 31, 2005, the Group will be required to apply 50% of the amount by which €30 million is exceeded
toward the prepayment of the Senior Credit Facilities (until such time as the ratio of Consolidated Total Net Debt
to Consolidated EBITDA, taking into account any such prepayment, is less than 3.75:1).

**_Events of default_**

The Senior Credit Facilities sets out certain events of default customary for senior debt of this magnitude,
the occurrence of which would allow the Lenders to accelerate all outstanding loans and terminate their
commitments.

**Bridge Facility**

The Bridge Facility was made available to the Issuer pursuant to a Bridge Facility Agreement dated
November 30, 2005 (as subsequently amended, the “Bridge Facility Agreement”) and entered into, among others,
the Issuer and Barclays Capital plc, Credit Suisse International, Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, J.P. Morgan
plc and The Royal Bank of Scotland plc as arrangers, the several original lenders named therein, J.P. Morgan
Europe Limited as facility agent and J.P. Morgan Europe Limited as security agent.

The drawings under the Bridge Facility were used to finance the Tender Offer and pay related fees and
expenses and to refinance certain indebtedness originally incurred by a parent company of the Issuer to finance
the Tender Offer. Approximately €269 million of commitments under the Bridge Facility remain available until
May 30, 2006.

The Bridge Facility accrues interest at a rate per annum based on the aggregate of three month reserveadjusted EURIBOR plus an initial spread of 6.75%. The spread will increase by 0.50% in the event the Bridge
Facility is not refinanced within six months of the Completion Date, with a further increase of 0.50% at the end
of each three-month period thereafter (subject to a maximum cash interest rate of 11.50% per annum and a
maximum total interest rate of 12.50% per annum). In the event that equity minorities of TDC remain after the
date falling 18 months after the Completion Date, the maximum cash interest rate will be increased to
12.00% per annum and the maximum total interest rate will be increased to 13.50% per annum.

The initial maturity date is 18 months after the Completion Date, with the final maturity date falling 10
years after the Completion Date. The initial maturity date will be automatically extended until the tenth
anniversary of the Completion Date if the Issuer is not subject to bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings.
The Bridge Facility will be repaid with the proceeds from the issuance of the notes.

The Bridge Facility is secured by a second-ranking pledge over the shares of the Purchaser, ratably with
the notes. The Bridge Facility contains certain negative covenants that are substantially similar to those under the
Senior Credit Facilities. Following the issuance of the notes, such negative covenants will be amended so as to be
substantially consistent with the notes.

**Intercreditor Agreement**

To establish the relative rights of certain of their creditors under the new financing arrangements, the Issuer,
Nordic Telephone Company Finance ApS and the Purchaser entered into an intercreditor agreement dated
November 30, 2005 (the “Intercreditor Agreement”), with the Senior Lenders, the creditors under the hedging
documents (the “Hedge Counterparties”), the Trustee for the Notes (the “Notes Trustee”) (upon accession), the
Security Agent and the Senior Agent. The Bridge Lenders and their representatives are also parties to the
Intercreditor Agreement. The additional entities that are borrowers and/or guarantors under the Senior Credit
Facilities have acceded or will accede to the Intercreditor Agreement. The Issuer and its subsidiaries are known as
the “Group” for the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement; the Issuer and any future obligors are each known as
an “Obligor.”

**_Order of priority_**

The Intercreditor Agreement provides for the following order of priority to apply to the satisfaction of the
obligations of the Group, other than the Issuer:

Š First the Senior Debt and the Hedging Debt (pari passu without any preference between themselves);


-----

Facility; and

Š Third, certain liabilities between members of the Group (“Intercompany Debt”).

The Intercreditor Agreement ranks debt at the Issuer level in the following order:

Š First, the Senior Midco Revolving Debt, the Notes Debt, the Bridge Facility Debt, guarantees of the
Senior Debt and any guarantee of the Hedging Debt, pari passu between themselves; and

Š Second, certain liabilities owed to Nordic Telephone Company Finance ApS (the “Investor Debt”) and
Intercompany Debt due, owing or incurred by the Issuer.

The Parties to the Intercreditor Agreement acknowledge that the Notes are senior obligations of the Issuer
and payments on the Notes by the Issuer are not restricted by or subject to the Intercreditor Agreement (save as
expressly stated in relation to turnover of amounts received in violation of the Intercreditor Agreement).

The Intercreditor Agreement provides that if at any time Notes have been or are to be issued by the Issuer
and any Senior Midco Revolving Debt remains outstanding or is available for utilisation, the Issuer will, as soon
as reasonably practicable after any request from the Senior Revolving Facility Lenders, execute Security in
favour of the Security Agent (for and on behalf of the Senior Revolving Facility Lenders) over any cash balance
retained by it from time to time on terms such that, prior to the Acceleration Date, its release will be automatic
provided that it is used for a purpose not prohibited under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Any such Security
shall be granted on terms such that it will be released on the date on which the Senior Midco Revolving Debt is
fully paid or discharged and all commitments in respect thereof have been cancelled.

**_Hedging Debt_**

The Intercreditor Agreement restricts the Issuer and the Hedging Banks from taking certain enforcement
and other actions in relation to its hedging obligations.

**_Restrictions on Investor Debt, Intercompany Debt, Notes Guarantee Debt, Notes On-Loan Debt and_**
**_Subordinated Debt_**

_Investor Debt_

Nordic Telephone Company Finance ApS may not, except with the prior consent of: (a) an Instructing Group and

pay, prepay, redeem, purchase, defease or otherwise acquire any Investor Debt, except as permitted by the
applicable facilities agreement; or (ix) exercise its voting rights as shareholder of the Issuer so as to permit or
require the declaration or payment by the Issuer of any dividend or distribution on or in respect of the share
capital of the Issuer or the redemption, repayment, reduction, repurchase, cancellation or other extinguishment of
any share in the capital of the Issuer (except where permitted to do so by the Intercreditor Agreement). Until the
Senior Discharge Date and for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt and Bridge Facility Debt only, no
Obligor or Investor shall (except with the prior consent of: (a) an Instructing Group and (b) if the Instructing
Group does not include or consists solely of the Notes Trustee and provided that no consent shall be required
where any such action is not prohibited by the covenants in the Notes Indenture, the Notes Trustee) amend or
give any waiver or consent under any provision of any Investor Document unless: (i) any amendment, variation,
novation or supplement which is of a minor or technical nature; (ii) as expressly permitted or required pursuant to


-----

which is not otherwise prohibited under the Intercreditor Agreement.

the Notes Major Terms or the Notes Guarantee Maturity Provisions unless previously approved by the Senior

**_Permitted Payments_**

The Intercreditor Agreement contains the following provisions:

(xii) an amount equal to €5,000,000 in aggregate in any financial year.

_Permitted Investor Payments_

subordination on insolvency, the relevant Obligor may pay, and the relevant investor may receive and retain
payments in respect of, any Investor Debt or dividends or distributions on or in respect of share capital of the
Issuer or in respect of any redemption, repayment, reduction, repurchase, cancellation or other extinguishment of
any shares in the capital of the Issuer, in each case to the extent permitted in accordance with the applicable
facilities agreement and the Notes Indenture.

_Permitted Intercompany Payments_

Subject to the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to suspension of payments and
subordination on insolvency, the relevant intercompany borrower may pay, and the relevant intercompany lender

facilities agreement provided that no such payment is made to the Issuer other than to the extent permitted in
accordance with the applicable facilities agreement.

**_Suspension of Payments_**

_Suspension of Permitted Notes Guarantee Payments and Permitted Notes On-Loan Payments_

There are presently no guarantees of the Notes, or on-loans of the proceeds of the Notes. However, to the
extent that guarantees are granted by Obligors in future in favor of the Notes, or such on-loans are created, the
following provisions will apply to them.


-----

Guarantor may make, and no Notes Finance Party or Noteholder may receive, any Permitted Notes Guarantees
Payment (other than Permitted Junior Securities and Notes Trustee Amounts); and (ii) no Notes On-Loan
Borrower may make, and the Notes On-Loan Lender may not receive, any Permitted Notes On-Loan Payment,

if, in each case:

(A) a Senior Payment Default is continuing; or

(B) a Material Senior Default, other than a Senior Payment Default, is continuing from the date
which is one Business Day after the date on which the Senior Agent delivers a Notes Stop Notice to a
Responsible Officer of the Notes Trustee and to the Notes Issuer until the earliest of:

1. the date falling 179 days after delivery of that Notes Stop Notice;

2. if a Notes Standstill Period is in effect at any time after the relevant Senior Default giving
rise to delivery of that Notes Stop Notice, the date on which that Notes Standstill Period expires;

3. the date on which the relevant Senior Default has been remedied or waived in accordance
with the Senior Facilities Agreement;

4. the date on which the Senior Agent delivers a notice to the Notes Trustee and the Notes
Issuer cancelling the Notes Stop Notice;

5. the date on which the Security Agent or the Notes Trustee takes Enforcement Action
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement in respect of the Notes Guarantee Debt; and

6. the Senior Discharge Date.

Unless the Notes Finance Parties, Noteholders and the Notes On-Loan Lender waive this requirement:
(i) a new Notes Stop Notice may not be delivered unless and until 360 days have elapsed since the delivery of the
immediately prior Notes Stop Notice; and (ii) no Notes Stop Notice may be delivered in reliance on a Senior
Default more than 45 days after the date the Senior Agent received notice of that Senior Default.

The Senior Agent may only serve one Notes Stop Notice with respect to the same event or set of
circumstances. Subject to the above paragraph, this shall not affect the right of the Senior Agent to issue a Notes
Stop Notice in respect of any other event or set of circumstances.

This provision: (i) acts as a suspension of payment and not as a waiver of the right to receive payment on
the dates such payments are due; (ii) will not prevent the accrual or capitalisation of interest (including default
interest) in accordance with the Notes Finance Documents; (iii) will not prevent the payment of any Notes
Trustee Amount; (iv) will not prevent the payment of: (A) audit fees, directors’ fees, taxes and any other proper
and incidental expenses required to maintain existence; and (B) amounts required to comply with obligations
under the Notes Finance Documents (but not any payment in respect of interest and principal or other monies to
the Notes Finance Parties or Notes On-Loan Lender and, without limitation to the generality of the foregoing, not
any payment in connection with any redemption, purchase or defeasance of the Notes), including fees to the
extent arising under the Fee Letters (as defined in the Senior Facilities Agreement) and costs and expenses (if
any) related to public reporting and ongoing administration of the Notes Finance Documents.

_Suspension of Permitted Investor Payments_

Until the Senior Discharge Date (and for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt only) and subject to the
provisions relating to subordination on insolvency, no Obligor may make, and no Investor may receive, any
Permitted Investor Payment if: (a) a Senior Declared Default or a Bridge Facility Declared Default is continuing;
or (b) a Suspension Event occurs and is continuing at the time it is to make or receive such a payment.

_Suspension of Permitted Intercompany Payments_

Until the Senior Discharge Date (and for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt only) and subject to the
provisions relating to subordination on insolvency, no Intercompany Borrower may make, and no Intercompany
Lender may receive, any Permitted Intercompany Payment: (a) if a Senior Declared Default or Bridge Facility
Declared Default is continuing; or (b) in relation to any Intercompany Debt due, owing or incurred, or to be
advanced, to the Notes Issuer only, a Suspension Event is continuing at the time it is to make or receive such a
payment.


-----

_Turnover_

Subject to applicable law and to the rights of creditors mandatorily preferred by law applying to
companies generally, until the Senior Discharge Date (and, for the purpose of clause (d) below only, the Notes
Discharge Date) if: (a) any Hedge Counterparty receives or recovers any recoveries in respect of hedging except
for any Permitted Hedging Payments; (b) any Notes Finance Party or Noteholder receives or recovers any
recoveries in respect of Note Guarantees except for any Permitted Notes Guarantees Payments; (c) any Notes
On-Loan Lender receives or recovers any recoveries in respect of a Notes On-Loan except for any Permitted

such payment was received or recovered from any person (directly or indirectly) which had benefited from an
amount received or recovered in violation of the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement; (e) any Investor receives
or recovers any recoveries in respect of Investor Debt except for any Permitted Investor Payments; and (f) any
Intercompany Lender receives or recovers any recoveries in respect of Intercompany Debt except for any
Permitted Intercompany Payments, (save in any case for any amount received by the Notes Trustee and paid to
the Noteholders where at the time of such payment the Notes Trustee has no actual knowledge that such receipt
or recovery falls within paragraph (d) above), that party (or Noteholder) shall:

(i) within three Business Days notify details of the receipt or recovery to the Security Agent;

(ii) hold any such assets and moneys received or recovered by it on trust for the Security Agent for
application in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to order of
application; and

(iii) within three Business Days of demand by the Security Agent, pay an amount equal to such
receipt or recovery (net of costs and expenses reasonably incurred in receiving or recovering such
payment) to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement relating to order of application.

**_Subordination on Insolvency_**

_Subordination events_

If: (a) any order is made or resolution passed for the suspension of payments, a moratorium of any
indebtedness, winding-up, dissolution, administration or reorganisation (by way of voluntary arrangement, scheme
of arrangement or otherwise) of any Obligor or Intercompany Borrower; (b) any Obligor or Intercompany Borrower
enters into any composition, assignment or arrangement with its creditors generally; (c) any liquidator, receiver,
administrator, administrative receiver, compulsory manager or other similar officer is appointed in respect of any
Obligor or Intercompany Borrower or any of its assets; or (d) any Security over any assets of any Obligor or
Intercompany Borrower is enforced, or any analogous event occurs in any jurisdiction, except in any case above as
part of a Permitted Reorganisation, the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement will apply.

In any such circumstances: (i) the Notes Guarantee Debt and the Notes On-Loan Debt will be subordinate
in right of payment to the Senior Debt and the Hedging Debt; and (ii) the Intercompany Debt and the Investor
Debt will be subordinate in right of payment to the Senior Debt, the Hedging Debt, the Notes Debt, the Notes
Guarantee Debt and the On-Loan Debt.

In the event that any of the circumstances mentioned above occur in relation to the Issuer, the Investor
Debt as to which the Issuer is an obligor will be subordinate in right of payment to the Notes Debt.

_Filing of claims_

In any of the circumstances mentioned above, until the Senior Discharge Date, the Security Agent may
and is irrevocably authorized on behalf of each secured party, Notes Finance Party, Notes On-Loan Lender and
subordinated party to: (i) demand, claim, enforce and prove for the Junior Debt; (ii) file claims and proofs, give
receipts and take any proceedings in respect of filing such claims or proofs and do anything which the Security
Agent considers (acting reasonably) necessary or desirable to recover the Junior Debt; and (iii) receive all
distributions of the Junior Debt for application in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement
relating to order of application.

If and to the extent that the Security Agent is not entitled, or elects not, to take any of the actions
mentioned above, each Junior Creditor (other than the Notes Trustee) shall do so promptly on request by the
Security Agent.


-----

_Distributions_

Subject, in the case of the Notes Trustee, to certain exceptions, in any of the circumstances mentioned
above, until the Senior Discharge Date, each Junior Creditor will: (a) hold all payments and distributions in cash
or in kind received or receivable by it in respect of the Junior Debt on trust for the Security Agent for application
in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to order of application; (b) within three
Business Days of demand by the Security Agent, pay an amount equal to any Junior Debt owing to it and
discharged by set-off or otherwise to the Security Agent for application in accordance with the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement relating to order of application; (c) promptly direct the trustee in bankruptcy, liquidator,
assignee or other person distributing the assets of the relevant Obligor or Intercompany Borrower or their
proceeds to pay distributions in respect of the Junior Debt directly to the Security Agent; and (d) promptly use its
reasonable efforts to undertake any action requested by the Security Agent to give effect to these provisions, save
that, in each case, the Notes Finance Parties and the Noteholders shall be entitled to receive and retain Permitted
Junior Securities (and payments funded from the proceeds of the issue of Permitted Junior Securities) and the
Notes Trustee shall be entitled to receive and retain any Notes Trustee Amounts.

_Voting_

In any of the circumstances mentioned above, until the Senior Discharge Date: (i) the Security Agent
may, and is hereby irrevocably authorized on behalf of each senior secured party, the Notes On-Loan Lender and
Subordinated Party to, exercise all of such parties’ powers of convening meetings, voting and representation in
respect of the senior security documents; and (ii) each such party other than the Notes Trustee shall promptly
execute and/or deliver to the Security Agent such forms of proxy and representation as it may require to facilitate
any such action. If and to the extent that the Security Agent is not entitled, or elects not, to exercise a power
under this paragraph, each such party shall: (i) exercise that power as the Security Agent (acting on the
instructions of an Instructing Group) directs; and (ii) not exercise that power so as to impair the ranking and/or
subordination contemplated by the Intercreditor Agreement.

Nothing in these provisions entitles the Security Agent (or an Instructing Group) to exercise or require
any such Junior Creditor referred to in paragraph (i) above to exercise a power of voting or representation to
waive, reduce, discharge, extend the due date for repayment of or reschedule any Junior Debt of Junior Creditor.

**_Ranking of Security_**

Except as otherwise provided in the Intercreditor Agreement, all Security created pursuant to: (i) the
Senior Security Documents will secure on a first ranking basis the Senior Debt and the Hedging Debt pari passu
(subject to any limitation on the Debt which may be secured under the terms of the Senior Security Document)
between themselves and ahead of any Notes Guarantee Debt and Security for the Notes Debt irrespective of the
order of execution, creation, registration, notice, enforcement or otherwise; and (ii) the Documents and the
Bridge Facility Security Documents will secure on a second-ranking basis the Notes Debt and any Notes
Guarantee Debt and the Bridge Facility Debt pari passu irrespective of: (A) the order of execution, creation,
registration, notice, enforcement or otherwise; (B) any provision ranking the Notes Debt or the Bridge Facility
Debt in right and priority of payment pari passu with the Senior Midco Revolving Debt; (C) the date on which
the Senior Debt or Hedging Debt arose; (D) whether a Senior Finance Party or Hedge Counterparty is obliged to
advance any Senior Debt or Hedging Debt; or (E) any fluctuation in the amount, or any intermediate discharge in
whole or in part, of any Senior Debt or Hedging Debt. Notwithstanding these provisions, only Security permitted
in accordance with the Notes Major Terms shall secure the Notes Debt and Notes Guarantee Debt. Any Notes
On-Loan Debt, the Investor Debt and Intercompany Debt, is and shall remain unsecured by the Security
Documents. The proceeds of enforcement of Security ranked by these provisions shall be applied in accordance
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to order of application of proceeds.

**_Restrictions on enforcement_**

The Intercreditor Agreement contains certain restrictions on enforcement by Hedging Counterparties. It
also contains the following restrictions:

_Restrictions on enforcement by the Notes On-Loan Lender and/or the Notes Security Documents_

Until the Senior Discharge Date, except with the prior consent of or as required by the Senior Agent
under the Senior Facilities Agreement: (a) the Notes On-Loan Lender shall not take any Enforcement Action in


-----

require the enforcement of, the Notes Security Documents; and (c) the Notes Finance Parties and Noteholders
shall not take or require the taking of any Enforcement Action in relation to the Notes Guarantees unless such
action is consistent with, and such Notes Guarantees comply with, the Notes Guarantee Maturity Provisions,
except as permitted by the Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that no such action required by the
Senior Agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement need be taken except to the extent the Senior Agent under
the Senior Facilities Agreement otherwise is entitled under the Intercreditor Agreement to direct such action.

_Restrictions on enforcement by the Investors_

Until the final discharge date, no Investor shall, except with the prior consent of or as required by an
Instructing Group, take any Enforcement Action in relation to any Investor Debt. If required by an Instructing
Group to take Enforcement Action, each Investor will apply any proceeds from that Enforcement Action in
accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to turnover.

_Restrictions on enforcement by the Intercompany Lenders_

Until the Senior Discharge Date and for the benefit of the holders of Senior Debt only, no Intercompany
Lender shall, except with the prior consent of or as required by an Instructing Group, take any Enforcement
Action in relation to any Intercompany Debt. If required by an Instructing Group to take Enforcement Action, the
Intercompany Lenders will apply any proceeds from that Enforcement Action in accordance with the provisions
of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to turnover.

_Permitted Notes On-Loan, Notes Guarantee and Notes Security Documents enforcement_

Subject to the below, the restrictions on enforcement set out above will not apply in respect of the Notes
Guarantee Debt and Notes On-Loan, if: (i) a Notes Default (the “Relevant Notes Default”) is continuing; (ii) the
Senior Agent has received a notice of the Relevant Notes Default specifying the event or circumstance in relation
to the Relevant Notes Default from the Notes Trustee; (iii) a Notes Standstill Period has elapsed; and (iv) the
Relevant Notes Default is continuing at the end of the relevant Notes Standstill Period. Promptly upon becoming
aware of a Notes Default, the Notes Trustee may by notice (a “Notes Default Notice”) in writing notify the
Senior Agent of the existence of such Notes Default.

In relation to a Relevant Notes Default, a Notes Standstill Period shall mean the period beginning on the
date (the “Notes Standstill Start Date”) the Notes Trustee serves a Notes Default Notice on the Senior Agent in
respect of such Relevant Notes Default and ending on the earlier to occur of:

(a) the date falling 179 days after the Notes Standstill Start Date;

(b) the date the Senior Finance Parties take any Enforcement Action in relation to a particular
Notes Guarantor provided, however, that:

(i) if a Notes Standstill Period ends pursuant to this paragraph (b), the Notes Finance Parties
and the Noteholders may only take the same Enforcement Action in relation to the Notes Guarantor
as the Enforcement Action taken by the Senior Finance Parties against such Notes Guarantor; and

(ii) Enforcement Action for the purpose of this paragraph (b) shall not include action taken to
preserve or protect any Security as opposed to realise it;

(c) the date of an event as described in the provisions related to subordination on insolvency in
relation to a particular Notes Guarantor; and

(d) the expiry of any other Notes Standstill Period outstanding at the date such first mentioned
Notes Standstill Period commenced.

The Notes Finance Parties and Noteholders or the Notes On-Loan Lender, as applicable, may take
Enforcement Action under these provisions in relation to a Relevant Notes Default even if, at the end of any
relevant Notes Standstill Period or at any later time, a further Notes Standstill Period has begun as a result of any
other Notes Default.

_Enforcement on behalf of Notes Finance Parties_

If the Security Agent has notified the Notes Agent that it is enforcing Security created pursuant to a
Permitted Enforcement Sale, no Notes Finance Party may take any action referred to above against any Obligor
while the Security Agent is taking all reasonable commercial steps to implement a Permitted Enforcement Sale


-----

If the Notes Finance Parties are permitted to give instructions to the Security Agent to require the
enforcement of the Security Interest constituted pursuant to any Notes Security Document in accordance with
these provisions, such Enforcement Action must require the realisation of the relevant Security Interest by way of
a Permitted Enforcement Sale and such realisation may only be implemented by way of a Permitted Enforcement
Sale.

_Permitted Investor enforcement_

The restrictions set out above on enforcement by the Investors) will not apply if an Insolvency Event is
continuing, except that the Investors may only exercise the rights set out in paragraph (a)(i) and, with the prior
consent of an Instructing Group, paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of Enforcement Action described below in
relation to the relevant entity.

_Permitted intercompany enforcement_

The restrictions set out above on enforcement by the Intercompany Lenders will not apply if an
Insolvency Event is continuing, except that the Intercompany Lenders may only exercise the rights set out in
paragraph (a)(i) and, with the prior consent of an Instructing Group, paragraph (a)(ii) of the definition of
Enforcement Action described below in relation to the relevant entity.

**_Application of Recoveries_**

_Order of application_

Subject to the rights of creditors mandatorily preferred by law applying to companies generally, the
proceeds of enforcement of the Security conferred by the Security Documents, all recoveries by the Security
Agent under guarantees of the Debt and all other amounts paid to the Security Agent pursuant to the Intercreditor
Agreement shall be applied in the following order:

relation to any unpaid fees, costs, expenses and liabilities incurred in respect of any litigation by or
on behalf of any Notes Finance Party or Noteholder against any of the Senior Finance Parties);

(b) second, pari passu to (i) in or towards payment to the Senior Agent for application towards any

(g) sixth, after the final discharge date, in payment of the surplus (if any) to the relevant Obligor
or other person entitled thereto.

**_Enforcement of Security_**

_Enforcement instructions_

Subject to the below, until the Senior Discharge Date, the Security Agent shall: (i) exercise any right,
power, authority or discretion vested in it as Security Agent in accordance with any instructions given to it by the
Senior Agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement (or, if so instructed by the Senior Agent under the Senior
Facilities Agreement, refrain from exercising any right, power, authority or discretion vested in it as Security
Agent); and (ii) not be liable for any act (or omission) if it acts (or refrains from taking any action) in accordance
with an instruction of the Senior Agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

Where: (i) the Notes Finance Parties are permitted to take Enforcement Action in relation to the Notes
Security Documents as specified above; and (ii) the Senior Finance Parties are not instructing the Security Agent
to take all reasonable commercial steps to implement a Permitted Enforcement Sale against an Obligor having
regard to the circumstances, which circumstances might be reasonably likely to adversely affect such Permitted
Enforcement Sale or the amount of proceeds to be derived therefrom, the Security Agent shall (but only as long
as the Senior Finance Parties are not so instructing the Security Agent) (i) exercise any right, power, authority or
discretion vested in it as Security Agent in accordance with any instructions given to it by the Notes Trustee (or,
if so instructed by the Notes Trustee, refrain from exercising any right, power, authority or discretion vested in it
as Security Agent); and (ii) not be liable for any act (or omission) if it acts (or refrains from taking any action) in
accordance with an instruction of the Notes Trustee subject to liability on the part of the Security Agent for gross
negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud.

After the Senior Discharge Date and until the Notes Discharge Date, the Security Agent shall: (i) exercise
any right, power, authority or discretion vested in it as Security Agent in accordance with any instructions given
to it by the Notes Trustee (or, if so instructed by the Notes Trustee, refrain from exercising any right, power,
authority or discretion vested in it as Security Agent); and (ii) not be liable for any act (or omission) if it acts (or
refrains from taking any action) in accordance with an instruction of the Notes Trustee subject to liability on the
part of the Security Agent for gross negligence, wilful misconduct or fraud.

Any instructions given in accordance with the above will be binding on all the Secured Parties and the
Noteholders.

The Security Agent may refrain from acting in accordance with any instructions given in accordance with
the above until it has received such security as it may require for any cost, loss or liability (together with any
associated VAT) which it may incur in complying with the instructions. In the absence of instructions given in
accordance with the above, the Security Agent may act (or refrain from taking action) as it considers to be in the
best interest of the Senior Finance Parties and, as the case may be, the Noteholders having regard to the other
parts of these provisions. The Security Agent is not authorized to act on behalf of a Secured Party or a
Noteholder (without first obtaining that party’s consent) in any legal or arbitration proceedings relating to any
Senior Finance Document, any Hedging Document, any Notes Finance Document or the Intercreditor
Agreement.

Following an acceleration, the Security Agent will act on the directions of the Majority Senior Creditors
(being the requisite majority of the Senior Lenders and the Hedge Counterparties) in connection with the
enforcement of the Transaction Security in situations where otherwise it would be obliged to act on the
instructions of the Senior Agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

Each of the Senior Creditors, the Senior Subordinated Creditors and the Security Agent is only permitted to
take Security Enforcement Action with respect to a Notes On-Loan in a manner that disposes of such asset to a third
party (other than the Security Agent (or its agent or nominee) in its capacity as such) if it does so concurrently with,
and in accordance with, the completion of a Permitted Enforcement Sale of the shares of a holdco.

Until after the Senior Discharge Date, no Creditor may enforce, or instruct the Security Agent to enforce,
any Security Interest granted over the shares of a holdco or any Security Interest over a Notes On-Loan in a
manner that disposes of such asset to a third party (other than the Security Agent (or its agent or nominee) in its
capacity as such) except in connection with a Permitted Enforcement Sale (except as may otherwise be provided
in the Notes Indenture)


-----

If, pursuant to or for the purpose of any Enforcement Action taken or to be taken by the Security Agent in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement, the Security Agent requires any release of any guarantee or
Security for the Senior Debt or the Hedging Debt granted by any member of the Group or (subject to the
conditions set out in the Intercreditor Agreement) of any Notes Guarantee or the Notes Security Documents, each
party shall promptly enter into any release and/or other document and take any action which the Security Agent
may reasonably require.

If in connection with any Enforcement Action: (i) the Security Agent (or any receiver) sells or otherwise
disposes of (or proposes to sell or otherwise dispose of) any asset under any Security Document; or (ii) a member
of the Group sells or otherwise disposes of (or proposes to sell or otherwise dispose of) any asset at the request of
the Security Agent or an Instructing Group, the Security Agent may, and is hereby irrevocably authorized on
behalf of each Party to: (A) release the Security created pursuant to the Security Documents over the relevant
asset; and (B) if the relevant asset comprises all of the shares in the capital of a member of the Group pledged in
favour of the Senior Finance Parties, release that member of the Group and any Subsidiary of it from all its past,
present and future liabilities and/or obligations (both actual and contingent) as a borrower or guarantor of the
whole or any part of the Debt (including any liability to any other member of the Group by way of guarantee or
contribution) and release any Security granted by that member of the Group or any Subsidiary of it over any asset
under any Security Document, provided that, in each case, the below conditions are satisfied.

It is a further condition to the release of the Notes Guarantees, Notes Security Documents and the whole
or any part of the Notes On-Loan Debt described in the preceding paragraph, that either: (i) any Notes Trustee
under the Indenture confirms to the Security Agent that the Noteholders have approved the release by the
requisite majority; or (ii) where the shares or asset of an Obligor or the shares of any direct or indirect Holding
Issuer of such Obligor (other than shares in a holdco as contemplated in clause (iii) of the next paragraph) are
sold that: (A) the sale is either made pursuant to a public auction, pursuant to any process or proceedings
approved or supervised by or on behalf of any court of law, or is otherwise made for fair market value (taking
into account the circumstances giving rise to the sale); (B) immediately prior to or concurrently with the
completion of such sale or disposal the relevant Obligor (or the Holding Company of such Obligor) in the case of
a sale of shares or the relevant asset, in the case of any disposal of assets, is simultaneously and unconditionally
released from all of its obligations in respect of the Senior Debt and the Notes Debt (except if and to the extent
the rights in respect of the Senior Debt and/or the Notes Debt are transferred to the purchaser or one or more of
its Affiliates); and (C) the net cash proceeds are applied in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor
Agreement relating to application of recoveries; or (iii)where the shares sold are those of a Relevant Holdco
pursuant to a Permitted Enforcement Sale that: (A) the Notes Finance Parties have a second ranking Security
Interest over the Disposed Entity (or an equivalent interest or claim) which entitles them to receive any surplus
net cash proceeds arising from the sale of the Disposed Entity upon completion of the Permitted Enforcement
Sale after the Senior Debt has been discharged in full (the “Surplus Proceeds”); or (B) if the requirements of
clause (iii)(A) of this paragraph are not satisfied, the terms of the Permitted Enforcement Sale require that if (but
only if) there are Surplus Proceeds, an amount equal to the lesser of the Surplus Proceeds and the amount of the
then outstanding Secured Debt is paid upon completion of the Permitted Enforcement Sale to the Security Agent
for application in accordance with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to application of
recoveries.

The net cash proceeds of sale or disposal shall be applied in or towards payment of Debt in accordance
with the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement relating to application of recoveries and, subject to applicable
law, all proceeds (if any) for the benefit of the Notes Debt shall have been, or contemporaneously with any such
release shall be:

(i) paid to Noteholders in repayment or redemption of their Notes;

(ii) deposited with the Security Agent or the Notes Trustee for the benefit of the Noteholders; or

(iii) deposited in an account in which a security interest has been perfected for the benefit of the
Noteholders.

Each Party shall promptly enter into any release and/or other document and take any action which the
Security Agent may reasonably require to give effect to the preceding paragraphs and in accordance with the
Intercreditor Agreement.

_Release of Security_

Each Secured Party and Notes Finance Party irrevocably authorises the Security Agent (and, to the extent
applicable the Note Trustee) to release in any manner whatsoever any Security and any guarantee (including any


-----

which is not pursuant to an Enforcement Action or Security Enforcement Action provided that such sale is in
compliance with the terms of the Finance Documents and the Security Agent (and to the extent applicable the
Note Trustee) shall as soon as reasonably practical execute any such release or take such other action as is
reasonably required to effect any such release at the expense of the Issuer.

**_Refinancing_**

The Senior Debt may, to the extent permitted under the Senior Finance Documents, be refinanced,
replaced, increased or otherwise restructured (a “Refinancing”) in whole or in part on terms that do not result in a
breach of any term of any agreement in respect of Junior Debt or the Indenture, and any obligations incurred by
the Group on such Refinancing in respect of the Senior Debt will, to the extent designated by the Issuer, rank
senior to the Junior Debt and otherwise benefit from the provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement on, mutatis
mutandis, the terms set out herein (and such obligations will constitute Senior Debt).

If a Refinancing occurs in accordance with the provisions set out above, then to the extent such
Refinancing is to benefit from any Security over assets secured on or shortly before the Refinancing in favour of
the Notes, then such Security in favour of the Notes may be required to be released by the Senior Agent and
replaced with new Security over such assets in favour of the Notes (ranking junior to any Security granted in
favour of the new Senior Debt) on substantially the same terms (including as to ranking) as before the
Refinancing; provided that following such release and replacement, no such new Security in favour of the Notes
is subject to any new hardening period (excluding any hardening period that existed prior to any such release and
replacement) which is not also applicable to the Security granted in favour of the new Senior Debt over the same
assets and is otherwise in compliance with the Notes Indenture.

**Debt Tender**

On December 21, 2005, in conjunction with the Tender Offer, the Issuer invited, subject to certain
conditions as set forth in an invitation memorandum of same date, the holders of any and all of the following
EMTNs to offer to sell them to the Issuer or another entity designated by the Issuer, and to consent to certain

1.28% notes due 2008, (c) €350,000,000 5.625% notes due 2009, (d) €1,000,000,000 5.20% notes due 2010 (the
“2010 EMTNs”), (e) €700,053,000 3.875% notes due 2011 (the “2011 EMTNs”) and (f) €750,000,000 6.50%
notes due 2012. Upon expiration of the Invitations on March 3, 2006, 53% or an equivalent of €1,615 million of
the EMTNs had been validly offered for sale.

On February 6, 2006, extraordinary meetings of the holders of the 2010 EMTNs and the 2011 EMTNs
resolved to disapply and delete most of the covenants and certain other terms contained in their respective trust
deeds and to add a new provision giving TDC the right to redeem all of the remaining 2010 EMTNs and 2011
EMTNs at any time upon not less than 10 days’ notice, at 99% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid
interest. On March 3, 2006, TDC assumed the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the Invitations and on March 10,
2006 acquired all of the EMTNs offered for sale pursuant to the Invitations. On March 20, 2006, TDC redeemed
the 2010 EMTNs and the 2011 EMTNs in full.

As of March 29, 2006, TDC had the following euro medium term notes outstanding, totaling €1,284
million (the “Outstanding EMTNs”): (a) DEM 500,000,000 5.00% notes due 2008, with €194 million equivalent
of notes outstanding; (b) JPY 3,000,000,000 1.28% notes due 2008, with €21 million equivalent of notes
outstanding; (c) €350,000,000 5.625% notes due 2009, with €345 million equivalent of notes outstanding;
(d) €750,000,000 6.50% notes due 2012, with €724 million equivalent of notes outstanding; and
(e) €1,350,000,000 5.875% notes due 2006, with €685 million equivalent of notes outstanding. The €685 million
of notes outstanding under the €1,350,000,000 5.875% notes due 2006 will be repaid by TDC upon maturity in
April 2006. All of the Outstanding EMTNs contain provisions customary in the Eurobond market. In particular,
they contain a negative pledge clause which limits our ability to secure certain types of indebtedness without also
securing the relevant Outstanding EMTNs. In addition, the €350,000,000 5.625% notes due 2009, the
€750,000,000 6.50% notes due 2012, and the €1,350,000,000 5.875% notes due 2006 may be redeemed at TDC’s
option at any time at the redemption price, as specified in the pricing supplements for the relevant notes. The
DEM 500,000,000 notes due 2008 are secured by certain subsidiaries of TDC.

**Danish Mortgage Loans**

As of March 29, 2006, TDC had four outstanding Danish mortgage loans granted by Nykredit Realkredit
A/S in April 2003 and totalling DKK 886 million (€118 7 million) These loans with final maturity in 2033


-----

loans have no instalment during the first 10 years and follow an annuity repayment schedule the following 20
years. These loans carry floating interest rate.

For each of TDC Services and TDC Solutions, a compulsory prepayment clause in the mortgage loans
documentation is triggered in the event that TDC does not control directly or indirectly at least 51% of the share
capital and the voting rights to such company.

**HTCC**

On February 9, 2005, HTCC entered into a €170 million Credit Facilities Agreement with Calyon and
Calyon Bank Hungary Rt. as Global Coordinators, Bookrunners and Mandated Lead Arrangers. The purpose of
the Credit Facilities Agreement was to refinance existing indebtedness and finance the acquisition of Pantel Rt.
The loans drawn under the Credit Facilities Agreement are to be repaid in semi-annual instalments, the last one
falling due on December 31, 2011. HTCC has provided security to the lenders in the form of a fixed and floating
charge over its assets, pledge of shares, receivables, properties and bank accounts. Furthermore, the Credit
Facilities Agreement imposes a series of financial and negative covenants, such as restrictions on acquisitions,
disposals and indebtedness. A compulsory prepayment clause in the Credit Facilities Agreement is triggered in
the event that TDC disposes of HTCC. The compulsory prepayment does not apply if HTCC’s Consolidated Net
Debt to Consolidated EBITDA, as defined in the Credit Facilities Agreement, has been less than 2.00:1.00 during
certain test periods or if TDC transfers all of its HTCC shares to an international recognised telecommunications
operator of similar standing to TDC and having a rating of BBB+ or higher by S&P or Baa1 or higher by
Moody’s.

**Hedging Agreements**

In order to document interest and exchange rate hedging transactions, TDC has entered into ISDA
Agreements with selected financial institutions. Such ISDA Agreements follow market standard terms and do not
require TDC to provide credit support.

**Contingent Liabilities Under Leasing Agreements**

In connection with capital sale and leaseback agreements, TDC has provided guarantees covering
intermediary leasing companies’ payment of the total lease commitments. TDC has made legally releasing
non-recurring payments to the intermediary leasing companies of an amount corresponding to the total lease
commitments. At December 31, 2005, the guarantees amounted to DKK 3,291 million (€441 million), compared
with DKK 3,030 million (€406 million) at December 31, 2004. The guarantees provided by TDC are
economically defeased by means of payment instruments issued by creditworthy obligors unrelated to TDC that
secure or otherwise provide for payment of the regular lease payments and purchase-option prices due from the
intermediary leasing companies. These instruments are lodged as security for payment of the regular lease
payments by the intermediary leasing companies.


-----

The Issuer will issue euro-denominated fixed rate notes ( Euro Fixed Rate Notes ), euro-denominated
floating rate notes (“Euro Floating Rate Notes”) and dollar-denominated fixed rate notes (“Dollar Notes,” and
collectively with the Euro Fixed Rate Notes and Euro Floating Rate Notes, the “Notes”) under an indenture to be
dated as of, 2006 (the “Indenture”), between itself, Deutsche Trustee Company Limited, as trustee
(the “Trustee”), Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as listing agent and principal paying agent, and Deutsche
Bank Luxembourg SA, as transfer agent, registrar and Luxembourg paying agent. Each of the Euro Fixed Rate
Notes, Euro Floating Rate Notes and Dollar Notes constitute a separate series of Notes but will be treated as a
single class of securities for all purposes under the Indenture, including for purposes of voting and taking all
other actions by holders of the Notes, except as otherwise specified herein.

The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, but this issuance of Euro Fixed Rate Notes is
limited to € million, the issuance of Euro Floating Rate Notes is limited to € million and the
issuance of Dollar Notes is limited to $ million. We may issue an unlimited principal amount of
additional Notes having identical terms and conditions as the Notes (the “Additional Notes”). We will only be
permitted to issue Additional Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the
covenant restricting the Incurrence of Indebtedness (as described below under “Certain Covenants — Limitation
on Indebtedness”). The Notes issued in this offering and, if issued, any Additional Notes will be treated as a
single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions
and offers to purchase, except as otherwise specified with respect to each series of Notes. Unless the context
otherwise requires, in this “Description of the Notes,” references to the “Notes” include the Notes and the
Additional Notes that are actually issued.

This “Description of the Notes” is intended to be an overview of the material provisions of the Notes, the
Indenture and the Security Document (as defined below). Since this description of the terms of the Notes is only
a summary, you should refer to the Indenture and the Security Document for complete descriptions of the
obligations of the Issuer and your rights. Copies of the Indenture are available as set forth under “Available
Information”.

You will find definitions of certain capitalized terms used in this Description of the Notes under the
heading “Certain Definitions”. For purposes of this Description of the Notes, references to (i) the “Issuer”, “we”,
“our”, and “us” refer only to Nordic Telephone Company Holding ApS, (ii) “Purchaser” refers to Nordic
Telephone Company ApS, (iii) “NTC Finance” refers to Nordic Telephone Company Finance ApS and

pledge of all of the shares of Purchaser, which shall be equally and ratably shared with any
Indebtedness outstanding under the Bridge Facility, and which will rank behind the security granted in
favor of the Senior Facilities Agreement (and may in future rank behind other security granted in
favor of other Indebtedness);

Š rank senior in right of payment to future Subordinated Shareholder Funding, if any;

Š rank equally in right of payment with any existing and future senior indebtedness of the Issuer,
including any indebtedness outstanding under the Bridge Facility, the guarantee of the Senior Credit
Facilities given by the Issuer, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility made by the Issuer
(and the Euro Floating Rate Notes, Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Dollar Notes rank equally with
each other);

Š be effectively subordinated to any existing and future secured Indebtedness of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries to the extent of the value of the assets securing such Indebtedness (unless such assets also
secure the Notes on an equal and ratable basis);

Š be effectively subordinated to any existing and future Indebtedness and obligations (including
obligations to trade creditors) of Subsidiaries of the Issuer;

Š mature on, 2016; and

Š be represented by one or more registered Notes in global form, but in certain circumstances may be
represented by Definitive Registered Notes See “Book-entry Delivery and Form ”


-----

The Issuer will issue € million in aggregate principal amount of Euro Fixed Rate Notes, €
million in aggregate principal amount of Euro Floating Rate Notes and $ million in aggregate principal
amount of Dollar Notes on the Issue Date. The Notes will mature on, 2016. The Euro Fixed Rate
Notes and Euro Floating Rate Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of €50,000 and in integral
multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof. The Dollar Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $75,000
and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

**Interest**

_Interest on the Euro Fixed Rate Notes and Dollar Notes_

Interest on the Euro Fixed Rate Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Dollar
Notes will accrue at the rate of % per annum. Interest on the Euro Fixed Rate Notes and Dollar Notes will:

Š accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was
most recently paid;

Š be payable in cash semi-annually in arrears on and, commencing on
, 2006; and

Š be payable to the holder of record of such Euro Fixed Rate Note or Dollar Notes, as applicable, on the
and immediately preceding the related interest payment date; and

Š be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Euro Fixed Rate Notes or Dollar Notes to receive the
payments of interest on such Euro Fixed Rate Notes or Dollar Notes are subject to applicable procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream or DTC, as applicable. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Euro Fixed
Rate Notes or Dollar Notes is not a Business Day at the place at which such payment is due to be paid, the
Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount due until the next succeeding Business Day at such
place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of any such delay.

**_Interest on Euro Floating Rate Notes_**

Interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes will accrue at a rate per annum (the “Applicable Rate”), reset
quarterly, equal to EURIBOR plus %, as determined by the calculation agent (the “Calculation Agent”), which
shall initially be Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch. Interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes will:

Š accrue from the date of original issuance or, if interest has already been paid, from the date it was
most recently paid;

Š be payable in cash quarterly on,, and,
commencing on, 2006; and

Š be payable to the holder of record of such Euro Floating Rate Note on the,,
and immediately preceding the related interest payment date.

The rights of holders of beneficial interests in the Euro Floating Rate Notes to receive the payments of
interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes are subject to applicable procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. If the due date for any payment in respect of any Euro Floating Rate Note is not a Business Day at the
place at which such payment is due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment on the amount
due until the next succeeding Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other
payment as a result of any such delay.

Set forth below is a summary of certain of the provisions from the Indenture relating to the calculation of
interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes.

“Determination Date,” with respect to an Interest Period will be the day that is two TARGET Settlement
Days preceding the first day of such Interest Period.

“EURIBOR,” with respect to an Interest Period, will be the rate (expressed as a percentage per annum)
for deposits in euros for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET Settlement Days after
the Determination Date that appears on Telerate Page 248 as of 11:00 a.m. Brussels time, on the Determination
Date. If Telerate Page 248 does not include such a rate or is unavailable on a Determination Date, the Calculation
Agent will request the principal London office of each of four major banks in the Euro-zone inter-bank market,
as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s offered quotation (expressed as a percentage per
annum) as of approximately 11:00 a m Brussels time on such Determination Date to prime banks in the Euro

-----

quotations are so provided, the rate for the Interest Period will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations. If
fewer than two such quotations are so provided, the Calculation Agent will request each of three major banks in
London, as selected by the Calculation Agent, to provide such bank’s rate (expressed as a percentage per annum),
as of approximately 11:00 a.m., London time, on such Determination Date, for loans in a Representative Amount
in euros to leading European banks for a three-month period beginning on the day that is two TARGET
Settlement Days after the Determination Date. If at least two such rates are so provided, the rate for the Interest
Period will be the arithmetic mean of such rates. If fewer than two such rates are so provided then the rate for the
Interest Period will be the rate in effect with respect to the immediately preceding Interest Period.

“Euro-zone” means the region comprised of member states of the European Union that adopt the euro.

“Interest Period” means the period commencing on and including an interest payment date and ending on
and including the day immediately preceding the next succeeding interest payment date, with the exception that
the first Interest Period shall commence on and include the Issue Date and end on and include, 2006.

“Representative Amount” means the greater of (i) €1,000,000 and (ii) an amount that is representative for
a single transaction in the relevant market at the relevant time.

“TARGET Settlement Day” means any day on which the Trans-European Automated Real-Time Gross
Settlement Express Transfer (TARGET) System is open.

“Telerate Page 248” means, the display page so designated on Bridge’s Telerate Service (or such other
page as may replace that page on that service, or such other service as may be nominated as the information
vendor).

The Calculation Agent shall, as soon as practicable after 11:00 a.m. (Brussels time) on each
Determination Date, determine the Applicable Rate and calculate the aggregate amount of interest payable in
respect of the following Interest Period (the ‘‘Interest Amount’’). The Interest Amount shall be calculated by
applying the Applicable Rate to the principal amount of each Euro Floating Rate Note outstanding at the
commencement of the Interest Period, multiplying each such amount by the actual amounts of days in the Interest
Period concerned divided by 360 and rounding the resultant figure upwards to the nearest available currency unit.
The determination of the Applicable Rate and the Interest Amount by the Calculation Agent shall, in the absence
of willful default, bad faith or manifest error, be final and binding on all parties. In no event will the rate of
interest on the Euro Floating Rate Notes be higher than the maximum rate permitted by applicable law.

**_Methods of Receiving Payments on the Notes_**

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on the Global Notes (as defined below) will be payable at the
specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents; provided that all such payments with respect to Notes
represented by one or more Global Note registered in the name of or held by a nominee of Euroclear,
Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
specified by the Holder or Holders thereof.

Principal, interest and premium, if any, on any certificated securities (“Definitive Registered Notes”) will
be payable at the specified office or agency of one or more Paying Agents in the City of London, the Borough of
Manhattan, City of New York, and Luxembourg, in each case, maintained for such purposes. In addition, interest
on the Definitive Registered Notes may be paid by check mailed to the person entitled thereto as shown on the
register for the Definitive Registered Notes. See “— Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes”.

**_Paying Agent and Registrar for the Notes_**

The Issuer will maintain a Paying Agent for the Notes in (i) the City of London, (ii) the Borough of
Manhattan, City of New York, and (iii) Luxembourg, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF and its
rules so require. The Issuer will also undertake, to the extent possible, to maintain a paying agent in a European
Union member state that will not be obliged to withhold or deduct tax pursuant to the European Union Directive
2003/48/EC regarding the taxation of savings income (the “Directive”). The initial Paying Agent will be
Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch.

The Issuer will also maintain one or more registrars (each, a “Registrar”) with offices in the City of
London and a transfer agent in each of (i) the City of London (ii) for so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro


-----

Bank Luxembourg SA. The Registrar and the transfer agent in Luxembourg and the transfer agent in London and
New York will maintain a register reflecting ownership of Definitive Registered Notes outstanding from time to
time, if any, and will make payments on and facilitate transfers of Definitive Registered Notes on behalf of the
Issuer. Each transfer agent shall perform the functions of a transfer agent.

The Issuer may change any Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer agent for any series of the Notes without
prior notice to the Holders of such Notes. However, for so long as Notes are listed on the Euro MTF and the rules
of the Euro MTF so require, the Issuer will publish notice of the change in a Paying Agent, Registrar or transfer
agent in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the d’Wort). The
Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent or Registrar in respect of any series of Notes.

**_Transfer and Exchange_**

The Notes will be issued in the form of several registered notes in global form without interest coupons,
as follows:

Š Each series of Notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule
144A under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form
without interest coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”).

– The 144A Global Notes representing Dollar Notes (the “Dollar 144A Global Notes”) will be
deposited upon issuance with a custodian for The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) and
registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC.

– The 144A Global Notes representing the Euro Fixed Rate Notes and Euro Floating Rate Notes (the
“Euro 144A Global Notes”) will, upon issuance, be deposited with and registered in the name of
the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear Bank S.A./N.V. (“Euroclear”) and
Clearstream Banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”).

Š Each series of Notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities
Act will initially be represented by one global note in registered form without interest coupons
attached (the “Regulation S Global Notes” and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global
Notes”).

– The Regulation S Global Notes representing Dollar Notes (the “Dollar Regulation S Global
Notes”) and the Regulation S Global Note representing the Euro Fixed Rate Notes and Euro
Floating Rate Notes (the “Euro Regulation S Global Notes”, and together with the Euro 144A
Global Notes, the “Euro Global Notes”) will, on the closing date, be deposited with and registered
in the name of the common depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Notes (“Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, or persons that may hold interests through such
participants. Ownership of interests in the Book-Entry Interests and transfers thereof will be subject to the
restrictions on transfer and certification requirements summarized below and described more fully under
“Transfer Restrictions.” In addition, transfers of Book-Entry Interests between participants in Euroclear,
participants in Clearstream or participants in DTC will be effected by Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as
applicable, pursuant to customary procedures and subject to the applicable rules and procedures established by
Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, and their respective participants.

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes denominated in the same currency only upon
delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the Securities Act.

Prior to 40 days after the date of initial issuance of the Notes, ownership of Reg S Book-Entry Interests
will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC or persons who hold interests
through Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, and any sale or transfer of such interest to US persons shall not be
permitted during such period unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities
Act. Subject to the foregoing, Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred to a person who takes
delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a written certification
(in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person who the
transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Transfer Restrictions” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other
jurisdiction.


-----

become a Book-Entry Interest in the Global Note to which it was transferred. Accordingly, from and after such
transfer, it will become subject to all transfer restrictions, if any, and other procedures applicable to Book-Entry
Interests in the Global Note to which it was transferred.

If Definitive Registered Notes are issued, they will be issued only in minimum denominations of €50,000
or $75,000 principal amount, as the case may be, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof or $1,000 in
excess thereof, as the case may be, upon receipt by the applicable Registrar of instructions relating thereto and
any certificates, opinions and other documentation required by the Indenture. It is expected that such instructions
will be based upon directions received by Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, from the participant
which owns the relevant Book-Entry Interests. Definitive Registered Notes issued in exchange for a Book-Entry
Interest will, except as set forth in the Indenture or as otherwise determined by the Issuer to be in compliance
with applicable law, be subject to, and will have a legend with respect to, the restrictions on transfer summarized
below and described more fully under “Transfer Restrictions.”

Subject to the restrictions on transfer referred to above, Euro Fixed Rate Notes and Euro Floating Rate
Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged, in whole or in part, in minimum
denominations of €50,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof and Dollar
Notes issued as Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred or exchanged in whole or in part, in minimum
denominations of $75,000 in principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. In connection
with any such transfer or exchange, the Indenture will require the transferring or exchanging holder to, among
other things, furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents, to furnish information regarding the
account of the transferee at Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, where appropriate, to furnish certain certificates and
opinions, and to pay any taxes, duties and governmental charges in connection with such transfer or exchange.
Any such transfer or exchange will be made without charge to the Holder, other than any taxes, duties and
governmental charges payable in connection with such transfer.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer is not required to register the transfer or exchange of any Notes:

(1) for a period of 15 days prior to any date fixed for the redemption of the Notes;

(2) for a period of 15 days immediately prior to the date fixed for selection of Notes to be redeemed in
part;

(3) for a period of 15 days prior to the record date with respect to any Interest Payment Date; or

(4) which the Holder has tendered (and not withdrawn) for repurchase in connection with a Change of
Control Offer or an Asset Disposition Offer.

The Issuer and the Trustee will be entitled to treat the Holder of a Note as the owner of it for all purposes.

**_Restricted Subsidiaries and Unrestricted Subsidiaries_**

Immediately after the issuance of the Notes, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be Restricted Subsidiaries
other than HTCC and its Subsidiaries. For 2005, HTCC, which prepares its financial statements in accordance
with U.S. GAAP, publicly reported revenues, adjusted EBITDA, cash and cash equivalents and long-term debt of
$110.2 million (€93.1 million), $50.6 million (€42.7 million), $15.1 million (€12.8 million) and $158.2 million
(€133.6 million), respectively, using the December 31, 2005 exchange rate of €1.00 = $1.1842. These figures are
not comparable with HTCC’s contribution to TDC’s results. In addition, in the circumstances described below
under “Certain Definitions — Unrestricted Subsidiary,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate Restricted
Subsidiaries as Unrestricted Subsidiaries. Unrestricted Subsidiaries will not be subject to any of the restrictive
covenants in the Indenture.

**Ranking**

The Notes are general obligations of the Issuer that rank senior in right of payment to all existing and
future Indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes rank equally in
right of payment with all existing and future liabilities of the Issuer that are not so subordinated, including any
indebtedness outstanding under the Bridge Facility, the guarantee of the Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities
Agreement given by the Issuer, and borrowings under the Revolving Credit Facility made by the Issuer (although
the Revolving Credit Facility will benefit from the right to receive certain enforcement proceeds prior to any
such payment to the Holders of the Notes) (and the Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the Euro Floating Rate Notes and the
Dollar Notes rank equally with each other). The Notes will be effectively subordinated to any future secured
Indebtedness of the Issuer secured by a first-priority interest in the Collateral or secured by other assets of the


-----

“Description of Other Indebtedness — Intercreditor Agreement.” The Notes have the benefit of the security as
described below under “Security.”

**Security**

**_General_**

The obligations of the Issuer under the Notes will be secured on a second-priority basis by a pledge of all
of the shares of Purchaser (the “Pledged Shares” or the “Collateral”).

The share pledge in respect of the Pledged Shares is referred to as the “Share Pledge” or the “Security
Document”.

Subject to certain conditions, including compliance with the covenant described under “Certain
Covenants — Impairment of Security Interest,” the Issuer is permitted to pledge the Collateral in connection with
future issuances of its Indebtedness or Indebtedness of its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Additional
Notes, in each case, permitted under the Indenture and on terms consistent with the relative priority of such
Indebtedness. In addition to the release provisions described below, the Security Interest (as defined below) in
the Collateral will be released upon the defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in “Defeasance” or
“Satisfaction and Discharge,” in each case, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture.

**_Priority_**

The relative priority between the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Bridge Facility
Agreement and the Trustee and the Holders under the Indenture with respect to the Collateral and the security
interest securing obligations under the Notes created by the Security Document (the “Security Interest”) is
established by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, the Indenture, the Security Document and the security
documents relating to the Senior Facilities Agreement, which provide that the obligations under the Senior
Facilities Agreement are secured by a first-priority interest in the Collateral and the obligations under the Bridge
Facility and the Notes are secured by a second-priority interest in the Collateral.

Please see the sections entitled “Description of Other Indebtedness — Intercreditor Agreement.” In
addition, pursuant to Additional Intercreditor Agreements entered into after the Issue Date, the Collateral may be
pledged to secure other Indebtedness. See “Certain Covenants — Impairment of Security Interest.”

**_Security Document_**

Under the Security Document, the Collateral will be pledged by the Issuer to secure the payment when
due of its payment obligations under the Notes and the Indenture. The Security Document will be entered into
among the Issuer and the Security Agent. When entering into the Security Document, the Security Agent will act
in its own name, but for the benefit of the Holders from time to time. Under the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Security Agent will also act on behalf of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement and the Bridge
Facility Agreement in relation to the security interest in favor of such lenders.

The Indenture will provide that, subject to the terms thereof and of the Security Document and the
Intercreditor Agreement, the Notes and the Indenture, as applicable, will be secured by the Security Interest in
the Collateral until all obligations under the Notes and the Indenture have been discharged. However, please see
the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Notes and the Offering”.

The Security Document provides that the rights with respect to the Notes and the Indenture must be
exercised by the Security Agent. Since the Holders are not a party to the Security Document, Holders may not,
individually or collectively, take any direct action to enforce any rights in their favor under the Security
Document. The Holders may only act through the Security Agent.

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interest created under the Security Document could be subject to potential challenges. If any
challenge to the validity of the Security Interest was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents. Please see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the
Notes and the Offering.”

In the event that the Issuer or its Subsidiaries enter into insolvency, bankruptcy or similar proceedings,
the Security Interest created under the Security Document could be subject to potential challenges. If any
challenge to the validity of the Security Interest was successful, the Holders may not be able to recover any
amounts under the Security Documents. Please see the section entitled “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the

in the event and for so long as all holders of Senior Indebtedness (including the lenders under the Senior
Facilities Agreement) have released their lien on the applicable Collateral or (b) following a Default under the
Indenture or a default under any other Indebtedness secured by the applicable Collateral, pursuant to an
Enforcement Sale meeting certain criteria, including as to public auction or the following of specified procedures
for the Enforcement Sale. See “Description of Other Indebtedness — Intercreditor Agreement — Limitations on
Enforcement.” In addition, the Security Interest created by the Security Document will be released (a) in
accordance with the Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (b) if the applicable
Subsidiary of which such Capital Stock is pledged is redesignated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance
with the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants — Limitations on Restricted Payments,” (c) to permit the
conversion of any Subsidiary of the Issuer into a different corporate form or any reorganization or restructuring
of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, in each case, not prohibited by the Indenture and (d) to the extent required to
enter into any Additional Intercreditor Agreement. The Security Agent will agree to any release of the Security
Interest created by the Security Documents that is in accordance with the Indenture and the Intercreditor
Agreement without requiring any consent of the Holders.

In addition, if Indebtedness permitted by the Indenture to be secured by the Collateral is incurred by the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary and in order to secure such Indebtedness on a first ranking basis or equally with
the Notes, on the date on which such Incurrence occurs, the Security Agent is authorized by the Holders to
release (and the Security Agent will release) the Security Interest in the Collateral and will, immediately after
such Liens are granted in respect of the new Indebtedness, re-take the Security Interest; provided that following
such release and retaking the Security Interest is not subject to any new hardening period or limitation (excluding
any such hardening period or limitation that existed prior to such release and retaking) which is not also
applicable to the Lien granted in favor of the new Indebtedness.

**_Enforcement of Security Interest_**

The Indenture and the Intercreditor Agreement restrict the ability of the Holders or the Trustee to enforce
the Security Interest and provide for the release of the Security Interest created by the Security Document in
certain circumstances upon enforcement by the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement. Under the
Intercreditor Agreement, the lenders under the Bridge Facility are also restricted from taking enforcement action
in relation to the Collateral to a similar extent to the holders of the Notes. These limitations are described under
“Description of Other Indebtedness — Intercreditor Agreement.”

In general, the rights of the Security Agent or the Holders to take enforcement action under the Security
Document with respect to the Collateral are subject to certain standstill provisions and other limitations on
enforcement. The Security Agent is also limited from taking enforcement actions that would otherwise be
permitted under the Intercreditor Agreement with respect to the Collateral if the security agent under the Senior
Facilities Agreement has given notice to the Trustee that it is enforcing the Security Interest over the Collateral.
Until the security agent for the Senior Facilities Agreement ceases to use all reasonable commercial steps to
enforce the security interest in favor of the lenders under the Senior Facilities Agreement having regard for the
circumstances (and the security agent for the Senior Facilities Agreement will give prompt written notice to the
Trustee of its ceasing so to enforce): (a) the Security Agent may not enforce the Security Interest in a manner that
would adversely affect the enforcement process instituted by the security agent for the Senior Facilities
Agreement pursuant to instructions of the Majority Senior Creditors; and (b) neither the Holders nor the Trustee
may give any instruction to the Security Agent to take any enforcement action prohibited by clause (a) above.

If the Trustee or any Holder receives proceeds of any enforcement of the Security Interest while the
obligations under the Senior Facilities Agreement are outstanding, the Trustee or such Holder, as applicable, will,
subject to certain exceptions, turn over such amounts to the Security Agent to be applied in the order described
under “Description of Other Indebtedness — Intercreditor Agreement — Turnover of Non-Permitted Payments.”

Similar provisions may be included in any Additional Intercreditor Agreement entered into in compliance
with “Additional Intercreditor Agreements.”

The Indenture will also provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of the Intercreditor Agreement and any Additional Intercreditor
Agreement.

available, any publicly available source of similar market data selected by the Issuer in good faith)) most nearly
equal to the period from the redemption date to, 2011; provided, however, that if the period from the
redemption date to, 2011 is not equal to the constant maturity of a direct obligation of the Federal
Republic of Germany for which a weekly average yield is given, the Bund Rate shall be obtained by linear
interpolation (calculated to the nearest one-twelfth of a year) from the weekly average yields of direct obligations
of the Federal Republic of Germany for which such yields are given, except that if the period from such
redemption date to, 2011 is less than one year, the weekly average yield on actually traded direct
obligations of the Federal Republic of Germany adjusted to a constant maturity of one year shall be used.

are not redeemable until, 2007. On and after, 2007, the Issuer may redeem all or, from time
to time, a part of the Euro Floating Rate Notes upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice, at the
following redemption prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) plus accrued and unpaid interest to,
but not including, the applicable redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record

beginning on of the years indicated below:

Floating Rate Note and (B):

with respect to any Euro Floating Rate Note on any redemption date, the excess (to the extent positive) of:

“Deemed Interest Payments” means, with respect to any Euro Floating Rate Note, the amount of interest
payments, as determined by the Issuer (in consultation with the Paying Agent) as of the relevant date, using an
interest rate equal to % plus the six-month forward EURIBOR for Euros as reported by Bloomberg.

Any such redemption and notice may, in the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of one or
more conditions precedent.

**_General_**

Notice of redemption will be provided as set forth under “Selection and Notice” below.

If the Issuer effects an optional redemption of Notes of a series, it will, for so long as the Notes are listed
on the Euro MTF, inform the Euro MTF of such optional redemption and confirm the aggregate principal amount
of the Notes of that series that will remain outstanding immediately after such redemption.

If the optional redemption date is on or after an interest record date and on or before the related Interest
Payment Date, the accrued and unpaid interest will be paid to the Person in whose name the Note is registered at
the close of business on such record date, and no additional interest will be payable to Holders whose Notes will
be subject to redemption by the Issuer.

**Sinking Fund**

The Issuer is not required to make mandatory redemption payments or sinking fund payments with
respect to the Notes.

**Redemption at Maturity**

On, 2016, the Issuer will redeem the Notes that have not been previously redeemed or
purchased and canceled at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the
redemption date (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant Interest Payment Date).

**Selection and Notice**

If less than all of any series of the Notes is to be redeemed at any time, the Trustee will select Notes for
redemption in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which that series
of Notes is listed, and in compliance with the requirements of DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, or if
the Notes are not so listed or such exchange prescribes no method of selection and the Notes are not held through
Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, or Euroclear, Clearstream or DTC, as applicable, prescribes no
method of selection, on a pro rata basis; provided, however, that no Note of €50,000 (in the case of Euro Fixed
Rate Notes or Euro Floating Rate Notes) or $75,000 (in the case of Dollar Notes) in aggregate principal amount
or less shall be redeemed in part.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF and the rules of the Euro MTF so require, the Issuer
shall publish notice of redemption in a daily newspaper with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is
expected to be the d’Wort) and in addition to such publication, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the
redemption date, mail such notice to Holders by first-class mail, postage prepaid, at their respective addresses as
they appear on the registration books of the Registrar.

If any Note is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption that relates to that Note shall state the
portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed. In the case of a portion of the original Note will be issued
in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note. In the case of a Global Note, an
appropriate notation will be made on such Note to decrease the principal amount thereof to an amount equal to
the unredeemed portion thereof. Subject to the terms of the applicable redemption notice, Notes called for
redemption become due on the date fixed for redemption. On and after the redemption date, interest ceases to
accrue on Notes or portions of them called for redemption.

**Redemption for Taxation Reasons**

The Issuer may redeem any series of Notes in whole as to such series, but not in part, at any time upon
giving not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders of the relevant series of Notes (which notice
will be irrevocable) at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued
and unpaid interest, if any, to the date fixed for redemption (a “Tax Redemption Date”) (subject to the right of
Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date) and all


-----

a result of:

(1) any change in, or amendment to, the law or treaties (or any regulations or rulings promulgated
thereunder) of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined below) affecting taxation; or

(2) any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation of such laws,
treaties, regulations or rulings (including a holding, judgment or order by a court of competent
jurisdiction) (each of the foregoing in clauses (1) and (2), a “Change in Tax Law”),

the Issuer is, or on the next interest payment date in respect of the relevant series of Notes would be, required to
pay any Additional Amounts, and such obligation cannot be avoided by taking reasonable measures available to
the Issuer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the appointment of a new Paying Agent where this would be
reasonable). Such Change in Tax Law must become effective on or after the date of this offering memorandum.
Notice of redemption for taxation reasons will be published in accordance with the procedures described under
“Selection and Notice.” Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier
than 90 days prior to the earliest date on which the Payor (as defined below) would be obliged to make such
payment of Additional Amounts and (b) unless at the time such notice is given, such obligation to pay such
Additional Amounts remains in effect. Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice of redemption of any
series of Notes pursuant to the foregoing, the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee (a) an Officer’s Certificate stating
that it is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a statement of facts showing that the conditions
precedent to its right so to redeem have been satisfied and (b) an opinion of an independent tax counsel of
recognized standing to the effect that the Issuer has been or will become obligated to pay Additional Amounts as
a result of a Change in Tax Law. The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient
evidence of the satisfaction of the conditions precedent described above, without further inquiry, in which event
it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

**Withholding Taxes**

All payments made by the Issuer or a successor of the Issuer (each, a “Payor”) on the Notes will be made
free and clear of and without withholding or deduction for, or on account of, any Taxes unless the withholding or
deduction of such Taxes is then required by law. If any deduction or withholding for, or on account of, any Taxes
imposed or levied by or on behalf of:

(1) Denmark or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having power to
tax;

(2) any jurisdiction from or through which payment on any such Note is made, or any political
subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the power to tax; or

(3) any other jurisdiction in which the Payor is organized or otherwise considered to be a resident for
tax purposes, or any political subdivision or governmental authority thereof or therein having the
power to tax (each of clause (1), (2) and (3), a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”),

will at any time be required from any payments made with respect to any Note, including payments of principal,
redemption price, interest or premium, if any, the Payor will pay (together with such payments) such additional
amounts (the “Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary in order that the net amounts received in respect of
such payments by the Holders or the Trustee, as the case may be, after such withholding or deduction (including
any such deduction or withholding from such Additional Amounts), will not be less than the amounts which
would have been received in respect of such payments on any such Note in the absence of such withholding or
deduction; provided, however, that no such Additional Amounts will be payable for or on account of:

(1) any Taxes that would not have been so imposed but for the existence of any present or former
connection between the relevant Holder (or between a fiduciary, settlor, beneficiary, member or
shareholder of, or possessor of power over the relevant Holder, if the relevant Holder is an estate,
nominee, trust, partnership, limited liability company or corporation) and the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction (including being a citizen or resident or national of, or carrying on a business or
maintaining a permanent establishment in, or being physically present in, the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction) but excluding, in each case, any connection arising solely from the acquisition,
ownership or holding of such Note or the receipt of any payment in respect thereof;

(2) any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that is imposed or withheld by reason of the
failure by the Holder or the beneficial owner of the Note to comply with a written request of the
Payor addressed to the Holder after reasonable notice to provide certification information


-----

requirement relating to such matters, which is required by a statute, treaty, regulation or
administrative practice of the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction as a precondition to exemption from
all or part of such tax, assessment or other governmental charge;

(3) any Taxes that are payable otherwise than by withholding from a payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest, if any, on the Notes;

(4) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, excise, transfer, personal property or similar tax, assessment or
other governmental charge;

(5) any Taxes that are required to be deducted or withheld on a payment to an individual pursuant to
the Directive or any law implementing, or introduced in order to conform to, such Directive;

(6) except in the case of the liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of the Payor, any Taxes imposed in
connection with a Note presented for payment by or on behalf of a Holder or beneficial owner
who would have been able to avoid such Tax by presenting the relevant Note to, or otherwise
accepting payment from, another paying agent in a member state of the European Union; or

(7) any combination of the above.

Such Additional Amounts will also not be payable (x) if the payment could have been made without such
deduction or withholding if the beneficiary of the payment had presented the Note for payment (where
presentation is required) within 30 days after the relevant payment was first made available for payment to the
Holder or (y) where, had the beneficial owner of the Note been the Holder, such beneficial owner would not have
been entitled to payment of Additional Amounts by reason of any of clauses (1) to (7) inclusive above.

The Payor will (i) make any required withholding or deduction and (ii) remit the full amount deducted or
withheld to the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction in accordance with applicable law. The Payor will use all reasonable
efforts to obtain certified copies of tax receipts evidencing the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld
from each Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction imposing such Taxes and will provide such certified copies to the
Trustee. Such copies shall be made available to the Holders upon request and will be made available at the
offices of the Luxembourg Paying Agent if the Notes are then listed on the Euro MTF. The Payor will attach to
each certified copy a certificate stating (x) that the amount of withholding Taxes evidenced by the certified copy
was paid in connection with payments in respect of the principal amount of Notes then outstanding and (y) the
amount of such withholding Taxes paid per €1,000 principal amount of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes or Euro
Floating Rate Notes or per $1,000 principal amount of the Dollar Notes, as the case may be.

If any Payor will be obligated to pay Additional Amounts under or with respect to any payment made on
any Note, at least 30 days prior to the date of such payment, the Payor will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s
Certificate stating the fact that Additional Amounts will be payable and the amount so payable and such other
information necessary to enable the Paying Agent to pay Additional Amounts to Holders on the relevant payment
date (unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises less than 45 days prior to the relevant payment
date, in which case the Payor may deliver such Officer’s Certificate as promptly as practicable after the date that
is 30 days prior to the payment date).

Wherever in the Indenture, the Notes or this Description of the Notes there are mentioned, in any context:

(1) the payment of principal,

(2) purchase prices in connection with a purchase of Notes,

(3) interest, or

(4) any other amount payable on or with respect to any of the Notes,

such reference shall be deemed to include payment of Additional Amounts as described under this heading to the
extent that, in such context, Additional Amounts are, were or would be payable in respect thereof.

The Issuer will pay any present or future stamp, court or documentary taxes, or any other excise, property
or similar taxes, charges or levies that arise in any jurisdiction from the execution, delivery, registration or
enforcement of any Notes, the Indenture, the Security Document or any other document or instrument in relation
thereto (other than a transfer of the Notes) excluding any such taxes, charges or similar levies imposed by any
jurisdiction that is not a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, and the Issuer agrees to indemnify the Holders for any
such taxes paid by such Holders. The foregoing obligations of this paragraph will survive any termination,
defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any
successor to the Issuer is organized or any political subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.


-----

If a Change of Control occurs, subject to the terms of the covenant described under this heading Change
of Control,” each Holder will have the right to require the Issuer to repurchase all of such Holder’s Notes at a
purchase price in cash equal to 101% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the
date of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on the relevant record date to receive interest due on
the relevant Interest Payment Date); provided, however, that the Issuer shall not be obliged to repurchase Notes
of any series as described under this heading, “Change of Control,” in the event and to the extent that it has
unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all of the Notes of such series as described under “Optional
Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived.

Unless the Issuer has unconditionally exercised its right to redeem all the Notes of a series as described
under “Optional Redemption” or all conditions to such redemption have been satisfied or waived, no later than
the date that is 60 days after any Change of Control, the Issuer will mail a notice (the “Change of Control Offer”)
to each Holder of any such Notes, with a copy to the Trustee:

(1) stating that a Change of Control has occurred or may occur and that such Holder has the right to
require the Issuer to purchase such Holder’s Notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 101% of
the principal amount of such Notes plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including, the date
of purchase (subject to the right of Holders of record on a record date to receive interest on the
relevant Interest Payment Date) (the “Change of Control Payment”);

(2) stating the repurchase date (which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days from the
date such notice is mailed) (the “Change of Control Payment Date”);

(3) describing the circumstances and relevant facts regarding the transaction or transactions that
constitute the Change of Control;

(4) describing the procedures determined by the Issuer, consistent with the Indenture, that a Holder
must follow in order to have its Notes repurchased; and

(5) if such notice is mailed prior to the occurrence of a Change of Control, stating that the Change of
Control Offer is conditional on the occurrence of such Change of Control.

On the Change of Control Payment Date, if the Change of Control shall have occurred, the Issuer will, to
the extent lawful:

(1) accept for payment all Notes properly tendered pursuant to the Change of Control Offer;

(2) deposit with the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Change of Control Payment in respect of all
Notes so tendered; and

(3) deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating the Notes or portions
of the Notes being purchased by the Issuer in the Change of Control Offer;

(4) in the case of Global Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the principal Paying Agent the
Global Notes in order to reflect thereon the portion of such Notes or portions thereof that have
been tendered to and purchased by the Issuer; and

(5) in the case of Definitive Registered Notes, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the relevant
Registrar for cancellation all Definitive Registered Notes accepted for purchase by the Issuer.

If any Definitive Registered Notes have been issued, the Paying Agent will promptly mail to each Holder
of Definitive Registered Notes so tendered the Change of Control Payment for such Notes, and the Trustee will
promptly authenticate and mail (or cause to be transferred by book entry) to each Holder of Definitive Registered
Notes a new Note equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Notes surrendered, if any;
provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount that is at least €50,000 or $75,000, as the case
may be, and integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof or $1,000 in excess thereof, as the case may be.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer
will publish a public announcement with respect to the results of the Change of Control Offer in a newspaper
with general circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the d’Wort).

The Change of Control provisions described above will be applicable whether or not any other provisions
of the Indenture are applicable. Except as described above with respect to a Change of Control, the Indenture
does not contain provisions that permit the Holders to require that the Issuer repurchase or redeem the Notes in
the event of a takeover, recapitalization or similar transaction. The existence of a Holder’s right to require the
Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control may deter a third party
from seeking to acquire the Issuer or its Subsidiaries in a transaction that would constitute a Change of Control


-----

requirements set forth in the Indenture applicable to a Change of Control Offer made by the Issuer and purchases
all Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn under such Change of Control Offer.

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to this
covenant. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of the
Indenture, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached its obligations under the Change of Control provisions of the Indenture by virtue of the conflict.

The Issuer’s ability to repurchase Notes issued by it pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may be limited
by a number of factors. The occurrence of certain of the events that constitute a Change of Control would require
a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement and would require the Issuer to
repay amounts outstanding under the Bridge Facility. In addition, certain events that may constitute a change of
control under the Senior Facilities Agreement and require a mandatory prepayment of Indebtedness under such
agreement may not constitute a Change of Control under the Indenture. Future Indebtedness of the Issuer or its
Subsidiaries may also contain prohibitions of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control or require
such Indebtedness to be repurchased upon a Change of Control. Moreover, the exercise by the Holders of their
right to require the Issuer to repurchase the Notes could cause a default under, or require a repurchase of, such
Indebtedness, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the financial effect of such repurchase on the
Issuer. Finally, the Issuer’s ability to pay cash to the Holders upon a repurchase may be limited by the Issuer’s
then existing financial resources. There can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available when
necessary to make any required repurchases.

Even if sufficient funds were otherwise available, the terms of the Senior Facilities Agreement and the
Intercreditor Agreement may (and other Indebtedness and any Additional Intercreditor Agreement may) prohibit
the Issuer’s prepayment of the Notes or the ability of the Issuer or the Issuer’s Subsidiaries to fund any such
payments before the scheduled maturity of the Notes. Consequently, if the Issuer or the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are
not able to prepay the Indebtedness outstanding under the Senior Facilities Agreement and any such other
Indebtedness containing similar restrictions or obtain requisite consents, the Issuer will be unable to fulfill its
repurchase obligations if Holders of Notes exercise their repurchase rights following a Change of Control,
resulting in a default under the Indenture. A payment default under the Indenture would result in a cross-default
under the Senior Facilities Agreement.

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the property and
assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries taken as a whole to specified other Persons. There is no precise
established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would involve a
disposition of “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person. As a result, it may be unclear as to
whether a Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder may require the Issuer to make an offer to
repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes as a result of a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the written consent of holders of a
majority in outstanding principal amount of the Notes.

**Certain Covenants**

**_Limitation on Indebtedness_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, Incur any Indebtedness
(including Acquired Indebtedness); provided, however, that the Issuer and any of its Restricted Subsidiaries may
Incur Indebtedness if on the date of such Incurrence and after giving pro forma effect thereto (including pro
forma application of the proceeds thereof), the Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries is less than 6.00 to 1.0.

The first paragraph of this covenant will not prohibit the Incurrence of the following Indebtedness:

(1) Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility (including in respect of letters of credit or
bankers’ acceptances issued or created thereunder), and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect
thereof and Guarantees in respect of such Indebtedness in a maximum aggregate principal amount
at any time outstanding not exceeding (i) €8,000 million (or if the Facility A2 Amount is not
drawn on or prior to July 30, 2006, €7,750 million), plus (ii) in the case of any refinancing of any
Indebtedness permitted under this clause (1) or any portion thereof the aggregate amount of fees

since the Issue Date applied by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to the covenant

to permanently reduce commitments thereunder);

(2) (a) Guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Indebtedness of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence of such Indebtedness is permitted under the

(b) without limiting the covenant described under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on
Liens,” Indebtedness arising by reason of any Lien granted by or applicable to such Person
securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary so long as the Incurrence
of such Indebtedness is permitted under the terms of the Indenture;

(3) Indebtedness of the Issuer owing to and held by any Restricted Subsidiary or Indebtedness of a
Restricted Subsidiary owing to and held by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; provided,
_however, that:_

(a) any subsequent issuance or transfer of Capital Stock or any other event which results in
any such Indebtedness being beneficially held by a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer; and

(b) any sale or other transfer of any such Indebtedness to a Person other than the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer,

shall be deemed, in each case, to constitute an Incurrence of such Indebtedness by the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be;

(4) Indebtedness represented by (a) the Notes (other than any Additional Notes), (b) any Indebtedness
(other than Indebtedness described in clauses (1) and (3)) outstanding on the Issue Date,
(c) Refinancing Indebtedness Incurred in respect of any Indebtedness described in this clause
(4) (other than the 2006 TDC Bonds) or clauses (5), (7), (11), (13) and (16) of this paragraph or
Incurred pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant, (d) Management Advances and (e) any
loan of the proceeds of the Notes;

(5) Indebtedness of any Person Incurred and outstanding on the date on which such Person becomes a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or is merged,
consolidated, amalgamated or otherwise combined with (including pursuant to any acquisition of
assets and assumption of related liabilities) the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (other than
Indebtedness Incurred (i) to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to consummate the
transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary or was otherwise acquired by the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or (ii) otherwise in
connection with or contemplation of such acquisition); provided, however, with respect to this
clause (5), that at the time of such acquisition or other transaction (x) the Issuer would have been
able to Incur €1.00 of additional Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of this covenant after
giving effect to the Incurrence of such Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (5) or (y) the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving effect
to such acquisition or other transaction;

(6) Indebtedness under Currency Agreements, Interest Rate Agreements and Commodity Hedging
Agreements entered into for bona fide hedging purposes of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries
and not for speculative purposes (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors or senior
management of the Issuer or TDC);

(7) Indebtedness represented by Capitalized Lease Obligations or Purchase Money Obligations, and
in each case any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, in an aggregate outstanding
principal amount which, when taken together with the principal amount of all other Indebtedness
Incurred pursuant to this clause (7) and then outstanding, will not exceed at any time outstanding
the greater of 2.34% of Total Assets and €250 million;

(8) Indebtedness in respect of (a) workers’ compensation claims, self-insurance obligations,
performance, indemnity, surety, judgment, appeal, advance payment, customs, VAT or other tax

obligations, in each case, Incurred or assumed in connection with the acquisition or disposition of
any business or assets or Person or any Capital Stock of a Subsidiary (other than Guarantees of
Indebtedness Incurred by any Person acquiring or disposing of such business or assets or such
Subsidiary for the purpose of financing such acquisition or disposition); provided that the
maximum liability of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in respect of all such Indebtedness
shall at no time exceed the gross proceeds, including the fair market value of non-cash proceeds
(measured at the time received and without giving effect to any subsequent changes in value),
actually received by the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with such disposition;

(10) Indebtedness arising from the honoring by a bank or other financial institution of a check, draft or
similar instrument drawn against insufficient funds in the ordinary course of business; provided,
_however, that such Indebtedness is extinguished within five Business Days of Incurrence;_

(11) Indebtedness in an aggregate outstanding principal amount which, when taken together with any

Incurred pursuant to this clause (11) and then outstanding, will not exceed the greater of 3.74% of
Total Assets and €400 million;

(12) Indebtedness Incurred by a Receivables Subsidiary in a Qualified Receivables Financing;

Proceeds received by the Issuer from the issuance or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary) of
its Subordinated Shareholder Funding or Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock, Designated
Preference Shares or an Excluded Contribution) or otherwise contributed to the equity (other than
through the issuance of Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares or an Excluded
Contribution) of the Issuer, in each case, subsequent to the Issue Date; provided, however, that
(i) any such Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for purposes
of making Restricted Payments under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (6) and (10) of the third
paragraph of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Restricted
Payments” to the extent the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries incur Indebtedness in reliance
thereon and (ii) any Net Cash Proceeds that are so received or contributed shall be excluded for
purposes of Incurring Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (13) to the extent the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries makes a Restricted Payment under the first paragraph and clauses (1),
(6) and (10) of the third paragraph of the covenant described below under “Certain Covenants —
Limitation on Restricted Payments” in reliance thereon;

(14) Indebtedness of the Issuer to the extent the net proceeds thereof are promptly:

(16) Indebtedness of the Issuer Incurred to finance the acquisition of TDC Shares not held by Issuer
and its Affiliates in an aggregate amount not to exceed €300 million.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this covenant, no Restricted Subsidiary which is a Significant
Subsidiary shall Guarantee any Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than (a) Indebtedness pursuant to the Senior
Facilities Agreement and any Refinancing Indebtedness in respect thereof, (b) any Bank Indebtedness Incurred
for the purposes of acquiring TDC Shares owned by Persons other than any Permitted Holders or (c) any


-----

extent and for so long as the Incurrence of such Guarantee could reasonably be expected to give rise to or result
in: (1) any violation of applicable law, rule or regulation; (2) any liability for the officers, directors or (except in
the case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership) shareholders of such Restricted Subsidiary (or, in the
case of a Restricted Subsidiary that is a partnership, directors or shareholders of the partners of such partnership);
or (3) any cost, expense, liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes) other than reasonable out of
pocket expenses and other than reasonable expenses Incurred in connection with any governmental or regulatory
filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to clause (1) undertaken in connection with, such
Guarantee, which in any case under any of clauses (1), (2) and (3) cannot be avoided through measures
reasonably available to the Issuer or the Restricted Subsidiary.

Future Guarantees granted pursuant to this provision shall be released (1) upon the sale of all the Capital
Stock of the applicable Guarantor pursuant to an Enforcement Sale in accordance with the Intercreditor
Agreement; (2) upon the sale or other disposition (including through merger or consolidation) in compliance with
the Indenture of the Capital Stock of the relevant Guarantor (or any parent company of such Guarantor other than
the Issuer or a Parent) following which such Guarantor is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary; or (3) upon the
defeasance or discharge of the Notes as provided in “Defeasance” or “Satisfaction and Discharge,” in each case,
in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Indenture. In addition, if a Guarantor is redesignated as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Restricted
Payments,” the relevant Guarantor will be released from all its obligation under its Guarantee. A Guarantee of a
future Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release either (i) there is no
Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not have
been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture if such Guarantor had not been designated as a Guarantor, or
(ii) there is no Indebtedness of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which
could not have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor
were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee and the Security Agent shall each take all
necessary actions, including the granting of releases or waivers under the Intercreditor Agreement, to effectuate
any release in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary protections and indemnifications.

For purposes of determining compliance with, and the outstanding principal amount of any particular
Indebtedness Incurred pursuant to and in compliance with, this covenant:

(1) in the event that Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the types of Indebtedness
described in the first and second paragraphs of this covenant, the Issuer, in its sole discretion, will
classify, and may from time to time reclassify, such item of Indebtedness and only be required to
include the amount and type of such Indebtedness in one of the clauses of the second paragraph or
the first paragraph of this covenant;

(2) all Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date under the Senior Facilities Agreement shall be
deemed initially Incurred on the Issue Date under clause (1) of the second paragraph of the
description of this covenant and not the first paragraph or clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of
the description of this covenant, and may not be reclassified pursuant to clause (1) of this
paragraph;

(3) Guarantees of, or obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar
instruments relating to, or Liens securing, Indebtedness that is otherwise included in the
determination of a particular amount of Indebtedness shall not be included;

(4) if obligations in respect of letters of credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments are
Incurred pursuant to any Credit Facility and are being treated as Incurred pursuant to clause (1),
(7), (11) or (13) of the second paragraph above or the first paragraph above and the letters of
credit, bankers’ acceptances or other similar instruments relate to other Indebtedness, then such
other Indebtedness shall not be included;

(5) the principal amount of any Disqualified Stock of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary, or
Preferred Stock of a Restricted Subsidiary, will be equal to the greater of the maximum mandatory
redemption or repurchase price (not including, in either case, any redemption or repurchase
premium) or the liquidation preference thereof;

(6) Indebtedness permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Indebtedness but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in
part by one or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Indebtedness; and

(7) the amount of Indebtedness issued at a price that is less than the principal amount thereof will be
equal to the amount of the liability in respect thereof determined on the basis of GAAP


-----

in the form of additional shares of Preferred Stock or Disqualified Stock or the reclassification of commitments
or obligations not treated as Indebtedness due to a change in GAAP, including a change of GAAP to U.S. GAAP,
will not be deemed to be an Incurrence of Indebtedness for purposes of the covenant described under this
“Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness.” The amount of any Indebtedness outstanding as of any date
shall be (a) the accreted value thereof in the case of any Indebtedness issued with original issue discount and
(b) the principal amount, or liquidation preference thereof, in the case of any other Indebtedness.

If at any time an Unrestricted Subsidiary becomes a Restricted Subsidiary, any Indebtedness of such
Subsidiary shall be deemed to be Incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer as of such date (and, if such
Indebtedness is not permitted to be Incurred as of such date under the covenant described under this “Certain
Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness,” the Issuer shall be in Default of this covenant).

For purposes of determining compliance with any euro-denominated restriction on the Incurrence of
Indebtedness, the Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of Indebtedness denominated in another currency shall
be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such Indebtedness was Incurred,
in the case of term Indebtedness, or first committed, in the case of Indebtedness Incurred under a revolving credit
facility; provided that (a) if such Indebtedness is Incurred to refinance other Indebtedness denominated in a
currency other than euros, and such refinancing would cause the applicable euro-denominated restriction to be
exceeded if calculated at the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date of such refinancing, such eurodenominated restriction shall be deemed not to have been exceeded so long as the principal amount of such
Refinancing Indebtedness does not exceed the principal amount of such Indebtedness being refinanced; (b) the
Euro Equivalent of the principal amount of any such Indebtedness outstanding on the Issue Date shall be
calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the Issue Date; and (c) if and for so long as
any such Indebtedness is subject to a Currency Agreement with respect to the currency in which such
Indebtedness is denominated covering principal and interest on such Indebtedness, the amount of such
Indebtedness, if denominated in euros, will be the amount of the principal payment required to be made under
such Currency Agreement and, otherwise, the Euro Equivalent of such amount plus the Euro Equivalent of any
premium which is at such time due and payable but is not covered by such Currency Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this covenant, the maximum amount of Indebtedness that the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur pursuant to this covenant shall not be deemed to be exceeded solely
as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies. The principal amount of any Indebtedness Incurred
to refinance other Indebtedness, if Incurred in a different currency from the Indebtedness being refinanced, shall
be calculated based on the currency exchange rate applicable to the currencies in which such Refinancing
Indebtedness is denominated that is in effect on the date of such refinancing.

**_Limitation on Restricted Payments_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to:

Stock) or in options, warrants or other rights to purchase such Capital Stock of the Issuer

installment or final maturity in each case due within one year of the date of purchase repurchase

therefrom);

from the first day of the first fiscal quarter commencing after the Issue Date to the

available (or, in the case such Consolidated Net Income is a deficit, minus 100% of
such deficit);

(ii) 100% of the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds, and the fair market value (as determined

returns of capital) to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(B) the redesignation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries as Restricted Subsidiaries
(valued, in each case, as provided in the definition of “Investment”) not to
exceed, in the case of any Unrestricted Subsidiary, the amount of
Investments previously made by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Unrestricted Subsidiary, which amount, in each case under this
clause (iv), was included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted
Payments; provided, however, that no amount will be included in
Consolidated Net Income for purposes of the preceding clause (i) to the
extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option) included under this clause (iv); and

(v) the amount of the cash and fair market value (as determined in accordance with the
next succeeding paragraph) of property or assets or of marketable securities

Subsidiary or an employee stock ownership plan or trust established by the
Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer for the benefit of its employees to the
extent funded by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) of Capital Stock
of an Unrestricted Subsidiary of the Issuer; and

(B) any dividend or distribution made by an Unrestricted Subsidiary to the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided, however, that no amount will be included in Consolidated Net Income for_
purposes of the preceding clause (i) to the extent that it is (at the Issuer’s option)
included under this clause (v); provided further, however, that such amount shall
not exceed the amount included in the calculation of the amount of Restricted
Payments.

The fair market value of property or assets other than cash covered by the preceding sentence shall be the
fair market value thereof as determined in good faith by the Operational Board of Directors.

The foregoing provisions will not prohibit any of the following (collectively, “Permitted Payments”):

(1) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of Capital
Stock, Disqualified Stock, Designated Preference Shares, Subordinated Shareholder Funding or
Subordinated Indebtedness made by exchange (including any such exchange pursuant to the

Capital Stock of the Issuer (other than Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares),
Subordinated Shareholder Funding or a substantially concurrent contribution to the equity (other
than through the issuance of Disqualified Stock or Designated Preference Shares or through an
Excluded Contribution) of the Issuer; provided, however, that to the extent so applied, the Net
Cash Proceeds, or fair market value (as determined in accordance with the preceding sentence) of
property or assets or of marketable securities, from such sale of Capital Stock or Subordinated
Shareholder Funding or such contribution will be excluded from clause (c)(ii) of the preceding
paragraph;

(2) any purchase, repurchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement of

case may be, that, in each case, is permitted to be Incurred pursuant to the covenant described
under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness” above, and that in each case, constitutes
Refinancing Indebtedness;

Indebtedness existing on the Issue Date (or incurred as a result of the conversion of any equity
existing on the Issue Date)):

Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” below, but only if the Issuer shall
have first complied with the terms described under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on
Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock” and purchased all Notes tendered pursuant to any
offer to repurchase all the Notes required thereby, prior to purchasing, repurchasing,
redeeming, defeasing or otherwise acquiring or retiring such Subordinated Indebtedness
and (ii) at a purchase price not greater than 100% of the principal amount of such
Subordinated Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest;

or suffer to exist any Lien (other than Permitted Liens) upon any of its property or assets (including Capital Stock
of a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer), whether owned on the Issue Date or acquired after that date, or any
interest therein or any income or profits therefrom, which Lien is securing any Indebtedness (such Lien, the
“Initial Lien”), unless contemporaneously with the Incurrence of such Initial Lien effective provision is made to
secure the Indebtedness due under the Indenture and the Notes, equally and ratably with, or prior to, in the case
of Liens with respect to Subordinated Indebtedness, the Indebtedness secured by such Initial Lien for so long as
such Indebtedness is so secured. Any such Lien thereby created in favor of the Notes will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged upon (i) the release and discharge of the Initial Lien to which it relates,
(ii) any sale, exchange or transfer to any Person other than the Issuer or any Subsidiary of the Issuer of the
property or assets secured by such Initial Lien or (iii) upon the defeasance or discharge of the Notes in
accordance with the Indenture.

**_Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create or otherwise cause or permit
to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual restriction on the ability of any
Restricted Subsidiary to:

(A) pay dividends or make any other distributions in cash or otherwise on its Capital Stock or pay any
Indebtedness or other obligations owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(B) make any loans or advances to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary; or

(C) sell, lease or transfer any of its property or assets to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

_provided that (x) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating distributions_
prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (y) the subordination of
(including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made to the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary to other Indebtedness Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary shall not
be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not prohibit:

(1) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to (a) any Credit Facility (including the Senior Finance
Documents or the Bridge Facility) or (b) any other agreement or instrument, in each case, in effect
at or entered into on the Issue Date;


-----

any Restricted Subsidiary, or on which such agreement or instrument is assumed by the Issuer or
any Restricted Subsidiary in connection with an acquisition of assets (other than Capital Stock or
Indebtedness Incurred as consideration in, or to provide all or any portion of the funds utilized to
consummate, the transaction or series of related transactions pursuant to which such Person
became a Restricted Subsidiary or was acquired by the Issuer or was merged, consolidated or
otherwise combined with or into the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary entered into or in
connection with such transaction) and outstanding on such date; provided that, for the purposes of

contained in any amendment, supplement or other modification to an agreement referred to in
clause (1) or (2) of this paragraph or this clause (3); provided, however, that the encumbrances and
restrictions with respect to such Restricted Subsidiary contained in any such agreement or
instrument are no less favorable in any material respect to the Holders taken as a whole than the
encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Initial Agreement or Initial Agreements to which
such refinancing or amendment, supplement or other modification relates (as determined in good
faith by the Issuer);

(4) any encumbrance or restriction:

(a) that restricts in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of any property
or asset that is subject to a lease, license or similar contract, or the assignment or transfer
of any lease, license or other contract;

(b) contained in mortgages, pledges or other security agreements permitted under the
Indenture or securing Indebtedness of the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary permitted under
the Indenture to the extent such encumbrances or restrictions restrict the transfer of the
property or assets subject to such mortgages, pledges or other security agreements; or

(c) pursuant to customary provisions restricting dispositions of real property interests set forth
in any reciprocal easement agreements of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) any encumbrance or restriction pursuant to Purchase Money Obligations and Capitalized Lease

encumbrances and restrictions contained in any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are


-----

documents associated therewith, and the Intercreditor Agreement, in each case, as in effect on the
Issue Date or (ii) in comparable financings (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) and where,
in the case of clause (ii), the Issuer determines at the time of issuance of such Indebtedness that
such encumbrances or restrictions will not adversely affect, in any material respect, the Issuer’s
ability to make principal or interest payments on the Notes or (b) constituting an Additional
Intercreditor Agreement;

(12) restrictions effected in connection with a Qualified Receivables Financing that, in the good faith
determination of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, are necessary or advisable to effect such

Liens.”

**_Limitation on Sales of Assets and Subsidiary Stock_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, make any Asset Disposition
unless:

(1) the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives consideration (including by
way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent
or otherwise) at least equal to the fair market value (such fair market value to be determined on
the date of contractually agreeing to such Asset Disposition), as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of the Issuer, of the shares and assets subject to such Asset Disposition
(including, for the avoidance of doubt, if such Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap);

(2) in any such Asset Disposition, or series of related Asset Dispositions (except to the extent the
Asset Disposition is a Permitted Asset Swap), at least 75% of the consideration from such Asset
Disposition (excluding any consideration by way of relief from, or by any other Person assuming
responsibility for, any liabilities, contingent or otherwise, other than Indebtedness) received by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, is in the form of cash, Cash Equivalents
or Temporary Cash Investments; and

(3) an amount equal to 100% of the Net Available Cash from such Asset Disposition is applied by the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be:

(a) to the extent the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, elects (or is
required by the terms of any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary), (i) to prepay, repay
or purchase any Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary (in each case, other than
Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) or Indebtedness under the
Senior Facilities Agreement, the Bridge Facility (or any Refinancing Indebtedness in
respect thereof (other than any Additional Notes that are Dollar Notes or Euro Fixed Rate
Notes)) and any Euro Floating Rate Notes within 365 days from the later of (A) the date of
such Asset Disposition and (B) the receipt of such Net Available Cash; provided, however,
that, in connection with any prepayment, repayment or purchase of Indebtedness pursuant
to this clause (a), the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary will retire such Indebtedness and
will cause the related commitment (if any) to be permanently reduced in an amount equal
to the principal amount so prepaid, repaid or purchased; (ii) to prepay, repay or purchase
Pari Passu Indebtedness at a price of no more than 100% of the principal amount of such
Pari Passu Indebtedness plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of such prepayment,
repayment or purchase; provided that the Issuer shall redeem, repay or repurchase Pari
Passu Indebtedness pursuant to this clause (ii) only if the Issuer makes (at such time or
subsequently in compliance with this covenant) an offer to the Holders of the Notes to
purchase their Notes in accordance with the provisions set forth below for an Asset
Disposition Offer for an aggregate principal amount of Notes at least equal to the
proportion that (x) the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding bears to
(y) the sum of the total aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding plus the total
aggregate principal amount outstanding of such Pari Passu Indebtedness or (iii) to pay to
the Bond Redemption Account; or

(b) to the extent the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary elects, to invest in or commit to
invest in Additional Assets (including by means of an investment in Additional Assets by a
Restricted Subsidiary with Net Available Cash received by the Issuer or another Restricted
Subsidiary) within 365 days from the later of (i) the date of such Asset Disposition and


-----

approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer that is executed or approved within such
time will satisfy this requirement, so long as such investment is consummated within
180 days of such 365th day;

_provided that, pending the final application of any such Net Available Cash in accordance with clause_
(a) or clause (b) above, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may temporarily reduce Indebtedness or
otherwise invest such Net Available Cash in any manner not prohibited by the Indenture.

Any Net Available Cash from Asset Dispositions that is not applied or invested or committed to be
applied or invested as provided in the preceding paragraph will be deemed to constitute “Excess Proceeds.” On
the 366th day after an Asset Disposition, if the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds €100 million, the
Issuer will be required to make an offer (“Asset Disposition Offer”) to all holders of Notes and, to the extent the
Issuer elects, to all holders of other outstanding Pari Passu Indebtedness, to purchase the maximum principal
amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Indebtedness to which the Asset Disposition Offer applies that may be
purchased out of the Excess Proceeds, at an offer price in respect of the Notes in an amount equal to (and, in the
case of any Pari Passu Indebtedness, an offer price of no more than) 100% of the principal amount of the Notes
and 100% of the principal amount of Pari Passu Indebtedness, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if
any, to, but not including, the date of purchase, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or the
agreements governing the Pari Passu Indebtedness, as applicable, and in case of the Euro Fixed Rate Notes or
Euro Floating Rate Notes in minimum denominations of €50,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess
thereof or, in the case of Dollar Notes, $75,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof.

To the extent that the aggregate amount of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not
properly withdrawn pursuant to an Asset Disposition Offer is less than the Excess Proceeds, the Issuer may use
any remaining Excess Proceeds for general corporate purposes, subject to other covenants contained in the
Indenture. If the aggregate principal amount of the Notes surrendered in any Asset Disposition Offer by Holders
and other Pari Passu Indebtedness surrendered by holders or lenders, collectively, exceeds the amount of Excess
Proceeds, the Excess Proceeds shall be allocated among the Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness to be purchased
on a pro rata basis on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of tendered Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness.
For the purposes of calculating the principal amount of any such Indebtedness not denominated in euro, such
Indebtedness shall be calculated by converting any such principal amounts into their Euro Equivalent determined
as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer Period (as defined below). Upon
completion of any Asset Disposition Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds shall be reset at zero.

Any Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes pursuant to this covenant will be apportioned
between the Euro Notes and the Dollar Notes in proportion to the respective aggregate principal amounts of Euro
Notes and Dollar Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn, based upon the Euro Equivalent of such principal
amount of Dollar Notes determined as of a date selected by the Issuer that is within the Asset Disposition Offer
Period.

To the extent that any portion of Net Available Cash payable in respect of the Notes is denominated in a
currency other than the currency in which the relevant Notes are denominated, the amount thereof payable in
respect of such Notes shall not exceed the net amount of funds in the currency in which such Notes are
denominated that is actually received by the Issuer upon converting such portion into such currency.

The Asset Disposition Offer, in so far as it relates to the Notes, will remain open for a period of not less
than 20 Business Days following its commencement (the “Asset Disposition Offer Period”). No later than five
Business Days after the termination of the Asset Disposition Offer Period (the “Asset Disposition Purchase
Date”), the Issuer will purchase the principal amount of Notes and, to the extent it elects, Pari Passu Indebtedness
required to be purchased by it pursuant to this covenant (the “Asset Disposition Offer Amount”) or, if less than
the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been so validly tendered, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness validly
tendered in response to the Asset Disposition Offer.

On or before the Asset Disposition Purchase Date, the Issuer will, to the extent lawful, accept for
payment, on a pro rata basis to the extent necessary, the Asset Disposition Offer Amount of Notes and Pari Passu
Indebtedness or portions of Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly withdrawn
pursuant to the Asset Disposition Offer, or if less than the Asset Disposition Offer Amount has been validly
tendered and not properly withdrawn, all Notes and Pari Passu Indebtedness so validly tendered and not properly
withdrawn and, in the case of Euro Fixed Rate Notes or Euro Floating Rate Notes, minimum denominations of
€50,000 and in integral multiples of €1,000 in excess thereof or, in the case of Dollar Notes, in minimum
denominations of $75,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will deliver to the
Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Notes or portions thereof were accepted for payment by the


-----

Period) mail or deliver to each tendering Holder of Notes an amount equal to the purchase price of the Notes so
validly tendered and not properly withdrawn by such Holder, and accepted by the Issuer for purchase, and the
Issuer will promptly issue a new Note (or amend the applicable Global Note), and the Trustee, upon delivery of
an Officer’s Certificate from the Issuer, will authenticate and mail or deliver (or cause to be transferred by book
entry) such new Note to such Holder, in a principal amount equal to any unpurchased portion of the Note
surrendered; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount with a minimum denomination of
€50,000 in the case of Euro Floating Rate Notes or Euro Fixed Rate Notes and $75,000 in the case of Dollar
Notes. Any Note not so accepted will be promptly mailed or delivered (or transferred by book entry) by the
Issuer to the Holder thereof.

For the purposes of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this covenant, the following will be deemed to be
cash:

(1) the assumption by the transferee of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness of the Issuer) or Indebtedness of a Restricted Subsidiary and the release of the Issuer
or such Restricted Subsidiary from all liability on such Indebtedness in connection with such
Asset Disposition;

(2) securities, notes or other obligations received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Issuer from the transferee that are converted by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary into cash
or Cash Equivalents within 180 days following the closing of such Asset Disposition;

(3) Indebtedness of any Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of
such Asset Disposition, to the extent that the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary are
released from any Guarantee of payment of such Indebtedness in connection with such Asset
Disposition;

(4) consideration consisting of Indebtedness of the Issuer (other than Subordinated Indebtedness)
received after the Issue Date from Persons who are not the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;
and

(5) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in
such Asset Dispositions having an aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other
Designated Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this covenant that is at that time
outstanding, not to exceed the greater of 1.87% of Total Assets and €200 million (with the fair
market value of each item of Designated Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time
received and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value).

The Issuer will comply, to the extent applicable, with the requirements of Section 14(e) of the Exchange
Act and any other securities laws or regulations in connection with the repurchase of Notes pursuant to the
Indenture. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with provisions of this
covenant, the Issuer will comply with the applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to
have breached its obligations under the Indenture by virtue of any conflict.

**_Limitation on Affiliate Transactions_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, enter
into or conduct any transaction (including the purchase, sale, lease or exchange of any property or the rendering
of any service) with any Affiliate of the Issuer (an “Affiliate Transaction”) involving aggregate value in excess of
€20 million unless:

(1) the terms of such Affiliate Transaction taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that could be obtained in a
comparable transaction at the time of such transaction or the execution of the agreement providing
for such transaction in arm’s-length dealings with a Person who is not such an Affiliate; and

(2) in the event such Affiliate Transaction involves an aggregate value in excess of €50 million, the
terms of such transaction have been approved by a majority of the members of the Operational
Board of Directors.

Any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in clause (2) of this
paragraph if such Affiliate Transaction is approved by a majority of the Disinterested Directors. If there are no
Disinterested Directors, any Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements set forth in
this covenant if the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries as the case may be delivers to the Trustee a letter


-----

its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a comparable transaction by the
Issuer or such restricted Subsidiary with an unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis.

The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not apply to:

(1) any Restricted Payment permitted to be made pursuant to the covenant described under “Certain
Covenants — Limitation on Restricted Payments,” any Permitted Payments (other than pursuant
to clause (9)(b)(ii) of the fourth paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants —
Limitations on Restricted Payments”) or any Permitted Investment (other than Permitted
Investments as defined in paragraphs (l)(b), (2), (11) and (15) of the definition thereof);

(2) any issuance or sale of Capital Stock, options, other equity-related interests or other securities, or
other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or otherwise pursuant to, or the funding of, or
entering into, or maintenance of, any employment, consulting, collective bargaining or benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement, related trust or other similar agreement and other
compensation arrangements, options, warrants or other rights to purchase Capital Stock of the
Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary or any Parent, restricted stock plans, long-term incentive plans,
stock appreciation rights plans, participation plans or similar employee benefits or consultants’
plans (including valuation, health, insurance, deferred compensation, severance, retirement,
savings or similar plans, programs or arrangements) or indemnities provided on behalf of officers,
employees, directors or consultants approved by the Board of Directors of the Issuer, in each case
in the ordinary course of business;

(3) any Management Advances and any waiver or transaction with respect thereto;

(4) any transaction between or among the Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary (or entity that becomes
a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such transaction), or between or among Restricted
Subsidiaries or any Receivables Subsidiary;

(5) the payment of reasonable fees and reimbursement of expenses to, and customary indemnities and
employee benefit and pension expenses provided on behalf of, directors, officers, consultants or
employees of the Issuer, any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer or any Parent (whether directly or
indirectly and including through any Person owned or controlled by any of such directors, officers
or employees);

(6) the Transactions and the entry into and performance of obligations of the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries under the terms of any transaction arising out of, and any payments pursuant
to or for purposes of funding, any agreement or instrument in effect as of or on the Issue Date, as
these agreements and instruments may be amended, modified, supplemented, extended, renewed or
refinanced from time to time in accordance with the other terms of this covenant or to the extent not
more disadvantageous to the Holders in any material respect and the entry into and performance of
any registration rights or other listing agreement in connection with any Public Offering;

(7) execution, delivery and performance of any Tax Sharing Agreement or the formation and
maintenance of any consolidated group for tax, accounting or cash pooling or management
purposes in the ordinary course of business;

(8) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in each
case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant Restricted
Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Operational Board of Directors or the senior
management of the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary, or are on terms no less favorable
than those that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party;

(9) any transaction in the ordinary course of business between or among the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary and any Affiliate of the Issuer or an Associate or similar entity that would constitute an
Affiliate Transaction solely because the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any Permitted Holder owns an equity interest
in or otherwise controls such Affiliate, Associate or similar entity;

For so long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will provide to the Trustee the following reports:

the most recently completed fiscal year; (c) an operating and financial review of the audited

containing a description of such event


-----

Exchange on such date) June 30, 2006 by providing the Trustee with the report that TDC is required to provide
(or otherwise distribute) to the Copenhagen Stock Exchange in connection with its listing on the Copenhagen
Stock Exchange, provided that such reports are in substantially the same form as the reports provided by TDC for
the period ended September 30, 2005.

All financial statement and pro forma financial information shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
as in effect on the date of such report or financial statement (or otherwise on the basis of GAAP as then in effect)
and on a consistent basis for the periods presented; provided, however, that the reports set forth in clauses (1),
(2) and (3) above may, in the event of a change in applicable GAAP, present earlier periods on a basis that
applied to such periods; provided, further, however, that such financial statements for the fiscal year ending
immediately prior to the first fiscal year for which financial statements have been reported pursuant to a change
in applicable GAAP to U.S. GAAP shall be restated to report consistent with the applicable U.S GAAP. Except
as provided for above, no report need include separate financial statements for the Issuer or Subsidiaries of the
Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other financial or statistical disclosure not
of a type included in this Offering Memorandum and in no event shall U.S. GAAP information (except if there
has been a change in applicable GAAP to U.S. GAAP) or reconciliation to U.S. GAAP be required.

At any time that any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such Unrestricted
Subsidiary or group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, if taken together as one Subsidiary, constitutes a Significant
Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the annual and quarterly financial information required by the first two clauses of this
covenant shall include either (i) a reasonably detailed presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in
the footnotes thereto, of the financial condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries
separate from the financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer or
(ii) stand-alone audited or unaudited financial statements, as the case may be, of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or
Unrestricted Subsidiaries (as a group or otherwise) together with an unaudited reconciliation to the financial
information of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, which reconciliation shall include the following items: revenue,
EBITDA, net income, cash, total assets, total debt, shareholders equity, capital expenditures and interest expense.

Substantially concurrently with the issuance to the Trustee of the reports specified in (1), (2) and
(3) above, the Issuer shall also (a) use its commercially reasonable efforts (i) to post copies of such reports on
such website as may be then maintained by the Issuer and its Subsidiaries or (ii) otherwise to provide
substantially comparable public availability of such reports (as determined by the Issuer in good faith) or (b) to
the extent the Issuer determines in good faith that it cannot make such reports available in the manner described
in the preceding clause (a) owing to applicable law or after the use of its commercially reasonable efforts, furnish
such reports to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes. In the event that (i) the
Issuer becomes subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or elects to
comply with such provisions, for so long as it continues to file the reports required by Section 13(a) with the SEC
or (ii) the Issuer elects to provide to the Trustee reports which, if filed with the SEC, would satisfy (in the good
faith judgment of the Issuer) the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act (other than
the provision of U.S. GAAP information, certifications, exhibits or information as to internal controls and
procedures), for so long as it elects, the Issuer will make available to the Trustee such annual reports,
information, documents and other reports that the Issuer is, or would be, required to file with the SEC pursuant to
such Section 13(a) or 15(d). Upon complying with the foregoing requirement, the Issuer will be deemed to have
complied with the provisions contained in the preceding four paragraphs.

In addition, so long as the Notes remain outstanding and during any period during which the Issuer is not
subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act nor exempt therefrom pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b), the Issuer
shall furnish to the Holders and, upon their request, prospective purchasers of the Notes, the information required
to be delivered pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act.

**_Merger and Consolidation_**

The Issuer will not consolidate with or merge with or into, or convey, transfer or lease all or substantially
all its assets to, any Person, unless:

(1) the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a Person
organized and existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union on January 1,
2004, or the United States of America, any State of the United States or the District of Columbia,
Canada or any province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland and the Successor Company (if not the
Issuer) will expressly assume, (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and delivered to the
Trustee, in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, all the obligations of the Issuer under the
Notes and the Indenture and (b) all obligations of the Issuer under the Intercreditor Agreement and
the Security Document;


-----

such transaction as having been Incurred by the Successor Company or such Subsidiary at the
time of such transaction), no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing;

(3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, either (a) the Successor Company would be
able to Incur at least an additional €1.00 of Indebtedness pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness” or (b) the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio would not be greater than it was immediately prior to giving effect
to such transaction; and

(4) the Issuer shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel,
each to the effect that such consolidation, merger or transfer and such supplemental indenture (if
any) comply with the Indenture and an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such supplemental
indenture (if any) has been duly authorized, executed and delivered and is a legal, valid and
binding agreement enforceable against the Successor Company (in each case, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee), provided that in giving an Opinion of Counsel,
counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to any matters of fact.

Any Indebtedness that becomes an obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary (or that is deemed
to be Incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary that becomes a Restricted Subsidiary) as a result of any such
transaction undertaken in compliance with this covenant, and any Refinancing Indebtedness with respect thereto,
shall be deemed to have been Incurred in compliance with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants —
Limitation on Indebtedness.”

For purposes of this covenant, the sale, lease, conveyance, assignment, transfer, or other disposition of all
or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more Subsidiaries of the Issuer, which properties and
assets, if held by the Issuer instead of such Subsidiaries, would constitute all or substantially all of the properties
and assets of the Issuer on a consolidated basis, shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Issuer.

The Successor Company will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Indenture but in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets, the predecessor
company will not be released from its obligations under the Indenture or the Notes.

Notwithstanding the preceding clauses (2) and (3) (which do not apply to transactions referred to in this
sentence) and, other than with respect to the second preceding paragraph, clause (4) of the first paragraph of this
covenant, (a) any Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with, merge into or
transfer all or part of its properties and assets to the Issuer, (b) any Restricted Subsidiary may consolidate or
otherwise combine with, merge into or transfer all or part of its properties and assets to any other Restricted
Subsidiary and (c) the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may undertake the Transactions. Notwithstanding the
preceding clause (3) (which does not apply to the transactions referred to in this sentence), the Issuer may
consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of
changing the legal domicile of the Issuer, reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction, or changing the legal
form of the Issuer.

There is no precise established definition of the phrase “substantially all” under applicable law.
Accordingly, in certain circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction
would involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

The foregoing provisions (other than the requirements of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this “Merger
and Consolidation” covenant) shall not apply to (i) any transactions which constitute an Asset Disposition if the
Issuer has complied with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Sales of Assets and
Subsidiary Stock” or (ii) the creation of a new subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion
Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:
“Certain Covenants — Limitation on Restricted Payments,” “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness,”
“Certain Covenants — Limitation on Restrictions on Distributions from Restricted Subsidiaries,” “Certain
Covenants — Limitation on Affiliate Transactions,” “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Sales of Assets and
Subsidiary Stock ” and under “Change of Control ” the provisions of clause (3) of the first paragraph of the


-----

provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries. Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from
the first day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any
effect with regard to actions of the Issuer properly taken during the continuance of the Suspension Event, and the
“Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of the
Indenture except that no default will be deemed to have occurred solely by reason of a Restricted Payment made
while that covenant was suspended. On the Reversion Date, all Indebtedness Incurred during the continuance of
the Suspension Event will be classified, at the Issuer’s option, as having been Incurred pursuant to the first
paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness” or one of the
clauses set forth in the second paragraph of such covenant (to the extent such Indebtedness would be permitted to
be Incurred thereunder as of the Reversion Date and after giving effect to Indebtedness Incurred prior to the
Suspension Event and outstanding on the Reversion Date). To the extent such Indebtedness would not be so
permitted to be incurred under the first two paragraphs of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants —
Limitation on Indebtedness,” such Indebtedness will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so
that it is classified as permitted under clause (4)(b) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness”.

**_Impairment of Security Interest_**

The Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, take or omit to take any action that
would have the result of materially impairing the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral (it being
understood, subject to the proviso below, that the Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens shall under no
circumstances be deemed to materially impair the Security Interest with respect to the Collateral) for the benefit
of the Trustee and the Holders, and the Issuer shall not, and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, grant to
any Person other than the Security Agent, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Holders and the other
beneficiaries described in the Security Document, any interest whatsoever in any of the Collateral, except that the
Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries may Incur Permitted Collateral Liens and the Collateral may be discharged
and released in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement; provided, however, that, except
with respect to any discharge or release in accordance with the Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement, the
Incurrence of Permitted Collateral Liens or any action expressly permitted by the Indenture or the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Security Document may not be amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or replaced, unless contemporaneously with any such action, the Issuer delivers to the
Trustee, either (1) a solvency opinion, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee from an
Independent Financial Advisor confirming the solvency of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after
giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or replacement, or (2) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee, confirming that, after giving effect to any transactions related to such amendment, extension, renewal,
restatement, supplement, modification or replacement, the Lien or Liens created under the Security Document, so
amended, extended, renewed, restated, supplemented, modified or replaced are valid Liens not otherwise subject
to any limitation, imperfection or new hardening period, in equity or at law, that such Lien or Liens were not
otherwise subject to immediately prior to such amendment, extension, renewal, restatement, supplement,
modification or replacement. In the event that the Issuer complies with the requirements of this covenant, the
Trustee shall (subject to customary protections and indemnifications) consent to such amendments without the
need for instructions from the Holders.

**_Additional Intercreditor Agreements_**

The Indenture will provide that, at the request of the Issuer, in connection with the Incurrence by the
Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries of any (1) Indebtedness permitted pursuant to the first paragraph of the
covenant described under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness” or clause (1), (4), (5), (6),
(7) (other than with respect to Capitalized Lease Obligations), (11), (13) or (16) of the second paragraph of the
covenant described under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness” and (2) any Refinancing
Indebtedness in respect of Indebtedness referred to in the foregoing clause (1), the Issuer, the relevant Restricted
Subsidiaries and the Trustee shall enter into with the holders of such Indebtedness (or their duly authorized
Representatives) an intercreditor agreement (an “Additional Intercreditor Agreement”) on substantially the same
terms as the Intercreditor Agreement (or terms not materially less favorable to the Holders), including containing
substantially the same terms with respect to the subordination, payment blockage, limitation on enforcement and
release of Guarantees, priority and release of the Security Interest; provided that only one Stop Notice can be
given in any 365-day period or in respect of the same event or circumstances regardless of the number of Credit


-----

Indebtedness under the Senior Facilities Agreement, the facility agent under the Senior Facilities Agreement may
give another Stop Notice within such period; provided that in no event may the total number of days for which a
Stop Notice is in effect exceed 179 days in the aggregate during any consecutive 365-day period); provided,
_further, that such Additional Intercreditor Agreement will not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or,_
in the opinion of the Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the
Indenture or the Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture also will provide that, at the direction of the Issuer and without the consent of Holders, the
Trustee shall from time to time enter into one or more amendments to any Intercreditor Agreement to: (1) cure
any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency of any such agreement, (2) increase the amount or types of
Indebtedness covered by any such agreement that may be Incurred by the Issuer that is subject to any such
agreement (including with respect to any Intercreditor Agreement or Additional Intercreditor Agreement the
addition of provisions relating to new Indebtedness ranking junior in right of payment to the Notes), (3) add
Restricted Subsidiaries to the Intercreditor Agreement or an Additional Intercreditor Agreement, (4) further
secure the Notes (including Additional Notes), (5) make provision for equal and ratable pledges of the Collateral
to secure Additional Notes or to implement any Permitted Collateral Liens or (6) make any other change to any
such agreement that does not adversely affect the Holders in any material respect. The Issuer shall not otherwise
direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to any Intercreditor Agreement without the consent of the Holders
of the majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, except as otherwise permitted below
under “Amendments and Waivers, “ and the Issuer may only direct the Trustee to enter into any amendment to
the extent such amendment does not impose any personal obligations on the Trustee or, in the opinion of the
Trustee, adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee under the Indenture or any
Intercreditor Agreement.

The Indenture shall also provide that, in relation to any Intercreditor Agreement, the Trustee shall consent
on behalf of the Holders to the payment, repayment, purchase, repurchase, defeasance, acquisition, retirement or
redemption of any obligations subordinated to the Notes thereby; provided, however, that such transaction would
comply with the covenant described under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Restricted Payments.”

The Indenture also will provide that each Holder, by accepting a Note, shall be deemed to have agreed to
and accepted the terms and conditions of any Intercreditor Agreement, (whether then entered into or entered into
in the future pursuant to the provisions described herein). A copy of the Intercreditor Agreement shall be made
available for inspection during normal business hours on any Business Day upon prior written request at the
offices of the Trustee and, for so long as any Notes are listed on the Euro MTF, at the offices of the Paying Agent
in Luxembourg.

**_Minority Gross-Up_**

For purposes of calculating compliance with, or availability under, clauses (11) and (15) of the definition
of “Permitted Investments” or under the first paragraph and clauses (1), (7) and (11) of the second paragraph of
the covenant described under “Certain Covenants — Limitation on Indebtedness” and the first paragraph and
clause (11) of the third paragraph of the covenant described under “Certain Covenants — Limitations on
Restricted Payments,” any amounts Incurred or utilized or to be Incurred or utilized by the Issuer and its
Restricted Subsidiaries, other than by (X) TDC and its Restricted Subsidiaries or (Y) any Guarantee of
obligations of TDC and its Restricted Subsidiaries, shall (to the extent that this would not otherwise result in
double-counting) be grossed-up in an amount equal to the product of (i) such availability or utilization and
(ii) 100/A, where “A” is the percentage of TDC Shares owned by Purchaser or its Affiliates (on a pro forma basis
after giving effect to such proposed utilization and related transactions and other previously announced or
pending transactions); provided, however, that any such gross up in respect of clauses (11) and (15) of the
definition of “Permitted Investments” or the first paragraph and clause (11) of the third paragraph of the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants — Limitations on Restricted Payments” shall only be grossed up pursuant to
this covenant to the extent of any leakage to the minority equity holders of TDC as a result of dividends or other
payments to fund such Investments.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following is an Event of Default under the Indenture:

(1) default in any payment of interest on any Note issued under the Indenture when due and payable,
continued for 30 days;

(2) default in the payment of the principal amount of or premium, if any, on any Note issued under
the Indenture when due at its Stated Maturity, upon optional redemption, upon required
repurchase upon declaration or otherwise;


-----

“Change of Control” above or under the covenants described under “Certain Covenants” above (in
each case, other than a failure to purchase Notes which will constitute an Event of Default under
clause (2) above);

(4) failure to comply for 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal
amount of the outstanding Notes with its other agreements contained in the Indenture;

(5) default under any mortgage, indenture or instrument under which there may be issued or by which
there may be secured or evidenced any Indebtedness for money borrowed by the Issuer or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries (or the payment of which is Guaranteed by the Issuer or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries) other than Indebtedness owed to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary
whether such Indebtedness or Guarantee now exists, or is created after the Issue Date, which
default:

(a) is caused by a failure to pay principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on such
Indebtedness, immediately upon the expiration of the grace period provided in such
Indebtedness (“payment default”); or

(b) results in the acceleration of such Indebtedness prior to its maturity (the “cross
acceleration provision”);

and, in each case, the principal amount of any such Indebtedness, together with the principal
amount of any other such Indebtedness under which there has been a payment default or the
maturity of which has been so accelerated, aggregates €75 million or more; provided, that no
Event of Default will have occurred if such default is in respect of the TDC Bonds or the 2006
TDC Bonds prior to May 30, 2006 or, if after such date but prior to July 30, 2006, the aggregate
amount of Indebtedness falling due is less than or equal to the sum of the Facility A2 Available
Commitments under the Senior Facilities Agreement at such time and the sole reason why such
default occurred was as a result of Transaction Documents being entered into and the making of
the Offer, and the performance of obligations arising as a result thereof and such default has
ceased no later than May 30, 2006 or, as the case may be, July 30, 2006, as applicable;

(6) certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or court protection of the Issuer or a Significant
Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken together (as of the latest audited
consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries), would constitute a
Significant Subsidiary (the “bankruptcy provisions”);

(7) failure by the Issuer or any Significant Subsidiary or group of Restricted Subsidiaries that, taken
together (as of the latest audited consolidated financial statements for the Issuer and its Restricted
Subsidiaries), would constitute a Significant Subsidiary to pay final judgments aggregating in
excess of €75 million (exclusive of any amounts that a solvent insurance company has
acknowledged liability for), which judgments are not paid, discharged or stayed for a period of
60 days after the judgment becomes final (the “judgment default provision”); and

(8) any security interest under the Security Document shall, at any time, cease to be in full force and
effect (other than in accordance with the terms of the relevant Security Document, the
Intercreditor Agreement, any Additional Intercreditor Agreement and the Indenture) for any
reason other than the satisfaction in full of all obligations under the Indenture or the release of any
such security interest in accordance with the terms of the Indenture, the Intercreditor Agreement,
any Additional Intercreditor Agreement or the Security Document or any such security interest
created thereunder shall be declared invalid or unenforceable or the Issuer shall assert in writing
that any such security interest is invalid or unenforceable and any such Default continues for
10 days (the “security default provisions”).

However, a default under clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7) of this paragraph will not constitute an Event of
Default until the Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture
notify the Issuer of the default and, with respect to clauses (3), (4), (5) and (7) the Issuer does not cure such
default within the time specified in clauses (3), (4), (5) or (7), as applicable, of this paragraph after receipt of
such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default described in clause (6) above) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee by notice to the Issuer or the Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
outstanding Notes under the Indenture by written notice to the Issuer and the Trustee, may, and the Trustee at the
request of such Holders shall declare the principal of premium if any and accrued and unpaid interest on all the


-----

Notes because an Event of Default described in clause (5) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is
continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be automatically annulled if the event of default or
payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to clause (5) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by
the holders of the Indebtedness, or the Indebtedness that gave rise to such Event of Default shall have been
discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with respect thereto and if (1) the
annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of
competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have been cured or waived.

If an Event of Default described in clause (6) above occurs and is continuing, the principal of, premium, if
any, and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Notes will become and be immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holders.

The Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture may waive all
past or existing Defaults or Events of Default (except with respect to nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest) and rescind any such acceleration with respect to such Notes and its consequences if rescission would
not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

Subject to the provisions of the Indenture relating to the duties of the Trustee, if an Event of Default
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the
Indenture at the request or direction of any of the Holders unless such Holders have offered to the Trustee
indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense. Except to
enforce the right to receive payment of principal or interest when due, no Holder may pursue any remedy with
respect to the Indenture or the Notes unless:

(1) such Holder has previously given the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;

(2) Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have requested the Trustee to
pursue the remedy;

(3) such Holders have offered the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against any loss, liability
or expense;

(4) the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and
the offer of security or indemnity; and

(5) the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes have not given the Trustee
a direction that, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day
period.

Subject to certain restrictions, the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Notes are
given the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that, in the event an
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use
the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee, however, may
refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is unduly
prejudicial to the rights of any other Holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking
any action under the Indenture, the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole
discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action.

The Indenture provides that if a Default occurs and is continuing and the Trustee is informed of such
occurrence by the Issuer, the Trustee must give notice of the Default to the Holders within 60 days after being
notified by the Issuer. Except in the case of a Default in the payment of principal of, or premium, if any, or interest
on any Note, the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as a committee of trust officers of the Trustee in good
faith determines that withholding notice is in the interests of the Holders. The Issuer is required to deliver to the
Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year, an Officer’s Certificate indicating whether the signers
thereof know of any Default that occurred during the previous year. The Issuer is required to deliver to the Trustee,
within 30 days after the occurrence thereof, written notice of any events of which it is aware which would constitute
certain Defaults, their status and what action the Issuer is taking or proposes to take in respect thereof.

The Notes provide for the Trustee to take action on behalf of the Holders in certain circumstances, but
only if the Trustee is indemnified to its satisfaction. It may not be possible for the Trustee to take certain actions
in relation to the Notes and, accordingly, in such circumstances the Trustee will be unable to take action,
notwithstanding the provision of an indemnity to it and it will be for Holders to take action directly


-----

Subject to certain exceptions, the Note Documents may be amended, supplemented or otherwise modified
with the consent of the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including
consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes) and, subject to
certain exceptions, any default or compliance with any provisions thereof may be waived with the consent of the
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes then outstanding (including consents obtained in
connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for, Notes); provided that, if any amendment,
waiver or other modification will only affect one series of the Notes, only the consent of a majority in principal
amount of the then outstanding Notes of such series shall be required. However, without the consent of Holders
holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount of Notes, an amendment or waiver may not,
with respect to any Notes held by a non-consenting Holder:

(1) reduce the principal amount of Notes whose Holders must consent to an amendment;

(2) reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note;

(3) reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any Note;

(4) reduce the premium payable upon the redemption of any Note or change the time at which any
Note may be redeemed, in each case as described above under “Optional Redemption”;

(5) make any Note payable in money other than that stated in the Note;

(6) impair the right of any Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on such Holder’s
Notes on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such
payment on or with respect to such Holder’s Notes;

(7) make any change in the provision of the Indenture described under “Withholding Taxes” that
adversely affects the right of any Holder of such Notes in any material respect or amends the
terms of such Notes in a way that would result in a loss of an exemption from any of the Taxes
described thereunder or an exemption from any obligation to withhold or deduct Taxes so
described thereunder unless the Payor agrees to pay Additional Amounts, if any, in respect
thereof;

(8) release the security interest granted for the benefit of the Holders in the Collateral other than
pursuant to the terms of the Security Document, the Intercreditor Agreement or as otherwise
permitted by the Indenture;

(9) waive a Default or Event of Default with respect to the nonpayment of principal, premium or
interest (except pursuant to a rescission of acceleration of the Notes by the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of such Notes and a waiver of the payment default that
resulted from such acceleration); or

(10) make any change in the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder, the Issuer, the Trustee and the other
parties thereto, as applicable, may amend or supplement any Note Documents to:

(1) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect, error or inconsistency;

(2) provide for the assumption by a successor Person of the obligations of the Issuer under any Note
Document;

(3) provide for uncertificated Notes in addition to or in place of certificated Notes (provided that the
uncertificated Notes are issued in registered form for purposes of Section 163(f) of the Code, or in
a manner such that the uncertificated Notes are described in Section 163(f)(2)(B) of the Code);

(4) add to the covenants or provide for a Guarantee for the benefit of the Holders or surrender any
right or power conferred upon the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary;

(5) make any change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect;

(6) at the Issuer’s election, comply with any requirement of the SEC in connection with the
qualification of the Indenture under the Trust Indenture Act, if such qualification is required;

(7) make such provisions as necessary (as determined in good faith by the Issuer) for the issuance of
Additional Notes;


-----

to the Notes, to add security to or for the benefit of the Notes, or to confirm and evidence the
release, termination, discharge or retaking of any Guarantee or Lien (including the Collateral and
the Security Document) with respect to or securing the Notes when such release, termination,
discharge or retaking is provided for under the Indenture, the Security Documents, the
Intercreditor Agreement or any Additional Intercreditor Agreement;

(9) to provide that any Indebtedness that becomes or will become an obligation of a Successor
Company pursuant to a transaction governed by the provisions described under “Certain
Covenants — Merger and Consolidation” (that is not a Subordinated Obligation) is Senior
Indebtedness for the purposes of the Indenture;

(10) to evidence and provide for the acceptance and appointment under the Indenture or the
Intercreditor Agreement of a successor Trustee pursuant to the requirements thereof or to provide
for the accession by the Trustee to any Note Document;

(11) in the case of the Security Document, to mortgage, pledge, hypothecate or grant a security interest
in favor of the Security Agent for the benefit of parties to the Senior Facilities Agreement, in any
property which is required by the Senior Facilities Agreement (as in effect on the Issue Date) to be
mortgaged, pledged or hypothecated, or in which a security interest is required to be granted to the
Security Agent, or to the extent necessary to grant a security interest for the benefit of any Person;
_provided that the granting of such security interest is not prohibited by the Indenture or the_
Intercreditor Agreement and the covenant described under “Certain Covenants — Impairment of
Security Interest” is complied with; or

(12) to limit or terminate the benefits available to any holder of Senior Indebtedness.

The Issuer will, for so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF, to the extent required by the rules of
the Euro MTF, inform the Euro MTF of any of the foregoing amendments, supplements and waivers and provide,
if necessary, a supplement to this prospectus setting forth reasonable details in connection with any such
amendments, supplements or waivers.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment of any Note Document. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the
proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any Holder of Notes given
in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by such tender.

For so long as the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF and the rules of such exchange so require, the Issuer
will publish notice of any amendment, supplement and waiver in Luxembourg in a daily newspaper with general
circulation in Luxembourg (which is expected to be the d’Wort).

**Acts by Holders**

In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of the Notes have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, the Notes owned by the Issuer or by any Person directly or indirectly controlled, or
controlled by, or under direct or indirect common control with, the Issuer will be disregarded and deemed not to
be outstanding.

**_Defeasance_**

The Issuer at any time may terminate all obligations of the Issuer under the Notes and the Indenture (“legal
defeasance”) and cure all then existing Defaults and Events of Default, except for certain obligations, including
those respecting the defeasance trust, the rights, powers, trusts, duties, immunities and indemnities of the Trustee
and the obligations of the Issuer in connection therewith and obligations concerning issuing temporary Notes,
registration of Notes, mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes and the maintenance of an office or agency for
payment and money for security payments held in trust. Subject to the foregoing, if the Issuer exercises its legal
defeasance option, the Security Document and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor
Agreements in effect at such time will terminate (other than with respect to the defeasance trust).

The Issuer at any time may terminate its obligations under the covenants described under “Certain
Covenants” (other than clauses (1) and (2) of “Certain Covenants — Merger and Consolidation”) and “Change of
Control” and the default provisions relating to such covenants described under “Events of Default” above, the
operation of the cross-default upon a payment default, the cross acceleration provisions, the bankruptcy
provisions with respect to the Issuer and Significant Subsidiaries, the judgment default provision, the guarantee
provision and the security default provision described under “Events of Default” above (“covenant defeasance”).


-----

Notes may not be accelerated because of an Event of Default with respect to such Notes. If the Issuer exercises
its covenant defeasance option with respect to the Notes, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of
an Event of Default specified in clause (3) (other than with respect to clauses (1) and (2) of the covenant
described under “Certain Covenants — Merger and Consolidation”), (4), (5), (6) (with respect only to the Issuer
and Significant Subsidiaries), (7), (8) or (9) under “Events of Default” above.

In order to exercise either defeasance option, the Issuer must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance
trust”) with the Trustee cash in euros or euro-denominated European Government Obligations or a combination
thereof (in the case of the Euro Floating Rate Notes or Euro Fixed Rate Notes) or in dollars or U.S. Government
Obligations or a combination thereof (in case of the Dollar Notes) for the payment of principal, premium, if any,
and interest on the Notes to redemption or maturity, as the case may be, and must comply with certain other
conditions, including delivery to the Trustee of:

(1) an Opinion of Counsel in the United States to the effect that Holders of the relevant Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
defeasance and will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the same amount and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not
occurred (and in the case of legal defeasance only, such Opinion of Counsel in the United States
must be based on a ruling of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable U.S.
federal income tax law);

(2) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and subject to customary
assumptions and exclusions, following the deposit, the trust funds will not be subject to the effect
of any applicable bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization, administration, moratorium,
receivership or similar laws affecting creditors’ rights generally under any applicable U.S. federal
or state law and that the Trustee has a perfected security interest in such trust funds for the ratable
benefit of the Holders;

(3) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not made by the Issuer with the intent of
defeating, hindering, delaying, defrauding or preferring any creditors of the Issuer;

(4) an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which opinion of counsel may be subject to
customary assumptions and exclusions), each stating that that all conditions precedent provided
for or relating to legal defeasance or covenant defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied
with;

(5) an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the trust resulting from the deposit does not constitute, or
is qualified as, a regulated investment company under the U.S. Investment Company Act of 1940;
and

(6) the Issuer delivers to the Trustee all other documents or other information that the Trustee may
reasonably require in connection with either defeasance option.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture, and the rights of the Trustee and the Holders under the Intercreditor Agreement and any
Additional Intercreditor Agreement and Security Document will be discharged and cease to be of further effect
(except as to surviving rights of conversion or transfer or exchange of the Notes, as expressly provided for in the
Indenture) as to all outstanding Notes when (1) either (a) all the Notes previously authenticated and delivered
(other than certain lost, stolen or destroyed Notes, and certain Notes for which provision for payment was
previously made and thereafter the funds have been released to the Issuer) have been delivered to the Trustee for
cancellation; or (b) all Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and
payable, (ii) will become due and payable at their Stated Maturity within one year or (iii) are to be called for
redemption within one year under arrangements reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of
redemption by the Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Issuer; (2) the Issuer has deposited or caused to
be deposited with the Trustee, money or euro-denominated European Government Obligations (in the case of
Euro Floating Rate Notes or Euro Fixed Rate Notes), U.S. Government Obligations (in the case of Dollar Notes),
or a combination thereof, as applicable, in an amount sufficient to pay and discharge the entire indebtedness on
the Notes not previously delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal, premium, if any, and interest to
the date of deposit (in the case of Notes that have become due and payable), or to the Stated Maturity or
redemption date, as the case may be; (3) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable under the
Indenture; and (4) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel each


-----

rely on any Officer’s Certificate as to matters of fact (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (1),
(2) and (3)).

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Shareholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or shareholder of the Issuer or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, as such, shall have any liability for any obligations of the Issuer under the Note
Documents or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each
Holder by accepting a Note waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part of the
consideration for issuance of the Notes. Such waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under the
U.S. federal securities laws and it is the view of the SEC that such a waiver is against public policy.

**Concerning the Trustee and Certain Agents**

Deutsche Trustee Company Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The Indenture
provides that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default, the Trustee will perform only such duties as
are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, the Trustee will exercise
such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of care that a prudent
Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or refrain from
taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty.

The Indenture imposes certain limitations on the rights of the Trustee, should it become a creditor of the
Issuer, to obtain payment of claims in certain cases, or to realize on certain property received in respect of any
such claim as security or otherwise. The Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer
and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture sets out the terms under which the Trustee may retire or be removed, and replaced. Such
terms will include, among others, (1) that the Trustee may be removed at any time by the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the then outstanding Notes, or may resign at any time by giving written notice to the Issuer
and (2) that if the Trustee at any time (a) has or acquires a conflict of interest that is not eliminated, (b) fails to
meet certain minimum limits regarding the aggregate of its capital and surplus or (c) becomes incapable of acting
as Trustee or becomes insolvent or bankrupt, then the Issuer may remove the Trustee, or any Holder who has
been a bona fide Holder for not less than 6 months may petition any court for removal of the Trustee and
appointment of a successor Trustee.

Any removal or resignation of the Trustee shall not become effective until the acceptance of appointment
by the successor Trustee.

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes
expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders of each series of Notes will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective
addresses in the register of the Holders of such Notes, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long
as any of the Notes are listed on the Euro MTF and the rules of the Euro MTF so require, notices with respect to
the Notes listed on the Euro MTF will be published in a leading newspaper having general circulation in
Luxembourg (which is expected to be the d’Wort) or if, in the opinion of the Trustee such publication is not
practicable, in an English language newspaper having general circulation in Europe. In addition, for so long as
any Notes are represented by Global Notes, all notices to Holders of the Notes will be delivered to Euroclear,
Clearstream and DTC, each of which will give such notices to the holders of Book-Entry Interests.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made; provided that, if notices are mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first-class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to him if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to
mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other
Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not
the addressee receives it.


-----

Claims against the Issuer for the payment of principal, or premium, if any, on the Notes will be prescribed
ten years after the applicable due date for payment thereof. Claims against the Issuer for the payment of interest
on the Notes will be prescribed five years after the applicable due date for payment of interest.

**Currency Indemnity and Calculation of Euro-Denominated Restrictions**

In the case of the Euro Floating Rate Notes or Euro Fixed Rate Notes, the euro, and in the case of the
Dollar Notes, the dollar, is respectively the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable by the
Issuer under or in connection with the Euro Floating Rate Notes, the Euro Fixed Rate Notes and the Dollar Notes,
as the case may be, including damages. Any amount received or recovered in a currency other than euro (in the
case of Euro Floating Rate Notes or Euro Fixed Rate Notes) or the dollar (in the case of Dollar Notes), whether
as a result of, or the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any jurisdiction, in the winding-up or
dissolution of the Issuer or otherwise by any Holder or by the Trustee, in respect of any sum expressed to be due
to it from the Issuer will only constitute a discharge to the Issuer to the extent of the euro amount or the dollar
amount, as the case may be, which the recipient is able to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in
that other currency on the date of that receipt or recovery (or, if it is not practicable to make that purchase on that
date, on the first date on which it is practicable to do so).

If that euro amount is less than the euro amount expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under
any Euro Floating Rate Note or Euro Fixed Rate Note, or if that dollar amount is less than the dollar amount
expressed to be due to the recipient or the Trustee under any Dollar Note, the Issuer will indemnify them against
any loss sustained by such recipient or the Trustee as a result. In any event, the Issuer will indemnify the
recipient or the Trustee against the cost of making any such purchase. For the purposes of this currency
indemnity provision, it will be prima facie evidence of the matter stated therein for the Holder of a Note or the
Trustee to certify in a manner satisfactory to the Issuer (indicating the sources of information used) the loss it
Incurred in making any such purchase. These indemnities constitute a separate and independent obligation from
the Issuer’s other obligations, will give rise to a separate and independent cause of action, will apply irrespective
of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note or the Trustee (other than a waiver of the indemnities set out
herein) and will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or to the Trustee.

Except as otherwise specifically set forth herein, for purposes of determining compliance with any eurodenominated restriction herein, the Euro Equivalent amount for purposes hereof that is denominated in a
non-euro currency shall be calculated based on the relevant currency exchange rate in effect on the date such
non-euro amount is Incurred or made, as the case may be.

**Enforceability of Judgments**

Since substantially all the assets of the Issuer are held by Subsidiaries located outside the United States, any
judgment obtained in the United States against the Issuer, including judgments with respect to the payment of
principal, premium, interest, and any redemption price and any purchase price with respect to the Notes, may not
be collectable within the United States.

**Consent to Jurisdiction and Service**

In relation to any legal action or proceedings arising out of or in connection with the Indenture and the
Notes, the Issuer will in the Indenture irrevocably submit to the jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the
Borough of Manhattan in the City of New York, County and State of New York, United States.

**Governing Law**

The Indenture and the Notes and the rights and duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. The Intercreditor Agreement and the rights and
duties of the parties thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and
Wales. The Security Document will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Denmark.

**General**

The notes offered hereby are denominated in euro and in dollars.

Each series of notes sold within the United States to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A
under the U.S. Securities Act will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest
coupons attached (the “144A Global Notes”). The 144A Global Note representing the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar
144A Global Note”) will be deposited upon issuance with a custodian for The Depositary Trust Company
(“DTC”) and registered in the name of Cede & Co., as nominee of DTC. The 144A Global Notes representing the
Euro Notes (the “Euro 144A Global Note”) and the Floating Rate Notes (the “Floating Rate 144A Global Note”)
respectively, will be deposited, on the closing date, with, or on behalf of, a common depository and registered in
the name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Each series of notes sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act
will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Regulation S
Global Note”, and, together with the 144A Global Notes, the “Global Notes”). The Regulation S Global Notes
representing the Dollar Notes (the “Dollar Regulation S Global Note”), the Euro Notes (the “Euro Regulation S
Global Note”) and the Floating Rate Notes (the “Floating Rate Regulation S Global Note”), respectively, will be
deposited, on the closing date, with, or on behalf of, a common depository and registered in the name of the
nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the 144A Global Notes (“144A Book-Entry Interests”) and ownership of
interests in the Regulation S Global Notes (the “Regulation S Book-Entry Interests” and, together with the 144A
Book-Entry Interests, the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have accounts with DTC,
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants. Book-Entry Interests
will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in book entry form by
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream
will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account with the
interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions, including certain states of the
United States, may require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in
definitive form. The foregoing limitations may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests.
In addition, while the notes are in global form, holders of Book-Entry Interests will not be considered the owners
or “holders” of notes for any purpose.

So long as the notes are held in global form, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable (or their
respective nominees), will be considered the sole holders of Global Notes for all purposes under the Indenture.
As such, participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as the case may be, and
indirect participants must rely on the procedures of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream and the participants through
which they own Book-Entry Interests, to transfer their interests or in order to exercise any rights of holders under
the Indenture.

Neither we nor the Trustee nor any of our respective agents will have any responsibility or be liable for
any aspect of the records in relation to the Book-Entry Interests.

**Issuance of Definitive Registered Notes**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive notes in
registered form (“Definitive Registered Notes”):

Š if DTC (with respect to the Dollar 144A Global Note), Euroclear or Clearstream (with respect to the
Dollar Regulation S Global Note, the Euro 144A Global Note, the Euro Regulation S Global Note, the
Floating Rate 144A Global Note and the Floating Rate Regulation S Global Note) notify us that it is
unwilling or unable to continue to act and a successor is not appointed by us within 120 days;

Š in whole, but not in part, if we, DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream so request following a default under
the Indenture; or

Š if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through DTC,
Euroclear and/or Clearstream or the Issuer following an Event of Default under the Indenture.

In such an event, the registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names and
issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream or the
Issuer as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions


-----

required by the Indenture or applicable law.

**Redemption of Global Notes**

In the event any Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, DTC, Euroclear and/or Clearstream (or
their respective nominees), as applicable, will distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note
so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in
respect of the redemption of such Global Note. The redemption price payable in connection with the redemption
of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the amount received by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any portion thereof). We understand that
under existing practices of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of the Notes are to be redeemed at
any time, DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream, will credit their respective participants’ accounts on a proportionate
basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or by lot or on such other basis as they deem fair and appropriate;
provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than €50,000 or $75,000, as applicable, principal amount
may be redeemed in part.

**Payments on Global Notes**

Payments of amounts owing in respect of the Global Notes (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by us to the Principal Paying Agent. The Principal
Paying Agent will, in turn, make such payments to DTC or its nominee (in the case of the Dollar 144A Global
Notes) and to the common depository or its nominee for Euroclear and Clearstream (in the case of the Dollar
Regulation S Global Note, the Euro 144A Global Note, the Euro Regulation S Global Note, the Floating Rate
144A Global Note and the Floating Rate Regulation S Global Note), which will distribute such payments to
participants in accordance with their respective procedures. We will make payments for all such amounts without
deduction or withholding for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, assessments or governmental
charges of whatever nature except as required by law.

Under the terms of the Indenture, we and the Trustee will treat the registered holder of the Global Notes
(i.e. DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream (or their respective nominees)) as the owner thereof for the purpose of
receiving payments and for all other purposes. Consequently, neither we nor the Trustee or any of our respective
agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

Š any aspects of the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by
DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising
or reviewing the records of DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

Š DTC, Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the
responsibility of such participants and we expect that they will be governed by standing customer instructions
and customary practices, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or
registered in “street name.”

**Currency and Payment for the Global Notes**

Except as may otherwise be agreed between DTC and any holder, the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Dollar 144A Global Notes will be paid to holders of
interests in such notes through DTC in dollars. Except as may otherwise be agreed between Euroclear and/or
Clearstream and any holder, the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in
respect of, the Euro 144A Global Note, the Euro Regulation S Global Note, the Floating Rate 144A Global Note
and the Floating Regulation S Global Note will be paid to holders of interests in such notes through Euroclear
and/or Clearstream in euro, and the principal of, premium if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable
in respect of the Dollar Regulation S Global Note, will be paid to holders of interest in such notes through
Euroclear and/or Clearstream in dollars.

**Action by Owners of Book-Entry Interests**

DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream have advised us that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in the


-----

exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Notes. However, if there is an event of default under the notes, each of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream
reserves the right to exchange the Global Notes for definitive registered notes in certificated form (the
“Definitive Registered Notes”), and to distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**Transfers**

Transfers of beneficial interest in the Global Notes between participants in DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream will be done in accordance with DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream’s rules and will be settled in
immediately available funds. If a holder requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason,
including to sell the notes to persons in states which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such
securities, such holder must transfer its interest in the Global Notes in accordance with the normal procedures of
DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture. The Global Notes will
bear a legend to the effect set forth in “Notice of Investors.” Book-Entry Interests in the Global Notes will be
subject to the restrictions on transfer discussed in “Notice to Investors.”

Book-Entry Interests in the 144A Global Notes may be transferred to a person who takes delivery in the
form of Book-Entry Interests in the Regulation S Global Notes denominated in the same currency only upon
delivery by the transferor of a written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such
transfer is being made in accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. Prior to 40 days after the date
of initial issuance of the notes, ownership of Regulation S Book-Entry Interests will be limited to persons that have
accounts with DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or persons who hold interests through DTC, Euroclear or
Clearstream, and any sale or transfer of such interest to U.S. persons shall not be permitted during such period
unless such resale or transfer is made pursuant to Rule 144A. Regulation S Book-Entry Interests may be transferred
to a person who takes delivery in the form of 144A Book-Entry Interests only upon delivery by the transferor of a
written certification (in the form provided in the Indenture) to the effect that such transfer is being made to a person
who the transferor reasonably believes is a “qualified institutional buyer” within the meaning of Rule 144A in a
transaction meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or otherwise in accordance with the transfer restrictions
described under “Notice to Investors” and in accordance with any applicable securities law of any other jurisdiction.

Definitive Registered Notes may be transferred and exchanged by Book-Entry Interests in a Global Note
only as described under “Description of the Notes — Transfer and Exchange” and, if required, only if the
transferor first delivers to the registrar and the transfer agent a written certificate (in the form provided in the
Indenture) to the effect that such transfer will comply with the appropriate transfer restrictions applicable to such
notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

**Information Concerning DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of DTC, Euroclear and
Clearstream, as applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for
the convenience of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that
settlement system and may be changed at any time. Neither we nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for
those operations or procedures.

DTC has advised us that it is:

Š a limited purpose trust company organized under New York Banking Law;

Š a “banking organization” under New York Banking Law;

Š a member of the Federal Reserve System;

Š a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code; and

Š a “clearing agency” registered under Section 17A of the U.S. Exchange Act.

DTC was created to hold securities for its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of
transactions among its participants. It does this through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of
securities participants, eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates, DTC participants
include securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations and certain other
organizations. DTC’s owners are the New York Stock Exchange, Inc., the American Stock Exchange, Inc. and
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and a number of its direct participants. Others, such as banks,
brokers and dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct
participant also have access to the DTC system and are known as indirect participants.


-----

book-entry changes in the accounts of such participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide various services to
their participants, including the safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of
internationally traded securities. Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear
and Clearstream participants are financial institutions such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks,
trust companies and certain other organizations. Indirect access to Euroclear and Clearstream is also available to
others such as banks, brokers, dealers and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship
with a Euroclear and Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because DTC can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of indirect participants and
certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to persons or entities that do
not participate in the DTC system, or otherwise take actions in respect of such interest, may be limited by the
lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some states require that certain persons take physical
delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the ability to transfer beneficial interests to such persons
may be limited. In addition, owners of beneficial interests through the DTC system will receive distributions
attributable to the 144A Global Notes only through DTC participants.

**Global Clearance and Settlement under the Book-Entry System**

The notes represented by the Global Notes are expected to be listed on the Euro MTF, the alternative
market of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and, except for trades involving only Euroclear and Clearstream,
participants, interests in the Dollar 144A Global Note will trade in DTC’s Same-Day Funds Settlement System,
and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such notes will, therefore, be required by DTC to be
settled in immediately available funds. Transfers of interests in the Euro 144A Global Note, the Euro Regulation
S Global Note, the Floating Rate 144A Global Note, the Floating Rate Regulation S Global Note and the Dollar
Regulation S Global Note between participants in Euroclear and Clearstream will be affected in the ordinary way
in accordance with their respective rules and operating procedures. Subject to compliance with the transfer
restrictions applicable to the Global Notes, cross-market transfers with respect to interests in Dollar 144A Global
between participants in DTC, on the one hand, and Euroclear or Clearstream participants, on the other hand, will
be done through DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of each of Euroclear or Clearstream.

Because of time zone differences, the securities account of a Euroclear or Clearstream participant
purchasing an interest in a Global Note from a participant in DTC will be credited, and any such crediting will be
reported to the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream participant, during the securities settlement processing day
(which must be a business day for Euroclear and Clearstream) immediately following the settlement date of
DTC. Cash received in Euroclear and Clearstream as a result of a sale of an interest in a Global Note by or
through a Euroclear or Clearstream participant to a participant in DTC will be received with value on the
settlement date of DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the
business day for Euroclear or Clearstream following DTC’s settlement date.

Although DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Notes among participants in DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may
be, they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. None of the Issuer, the Trustee or the Principal Paying Agent will have any
responsibility for the performance by DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants or indirect
participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Euro Notes and the Floating Rate Notes will be made in euros and for the Dollar
Notes in dollars. Book- Entry Interests owned through DTC, Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the
settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited
to the securities custody accounts of DTC, Euroclear and Clearstream holders on the business day following the
settlement date against payment for value of the settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and DTC and will
settle in same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the
time of trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to
ensure that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**United States Federal Income Tax Consequences**

**To ensure compliance with Internal Revenue Service Circular 230, you are hereby notified that any**
**discussion of tax matters set forth in this offering memorandum was written in connection with the**
**promotion or marketing of the transactions or matters addressed herein and was not intended or written**
**to be used, and cannot be used by any prospective investor, for the purpose of avoiding tax-related**
**penalties under federal, state or local tax law. Each prospective investor should seek advice based on its**
**particular circumstances from an independent tax advisor.**

The following is a summary of certain United States federal income tax consequences of the purchase,
ownership and disposition of notes as of the date hereof. Except where noted, this summary deals only with notes
that are held as capital assets by a U.S. holder (as defined below) who acquired our notes upon original issuance
at their initial offering price.

A “U.S. holder” means a person that is for United States federal income tax purposes any of the
following:

Š an individual citizen or resident of the United States;

Š a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax
purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States, any state thereof or the
District of Columbia;

Š an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its
source; or

Š a trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more
United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a
valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United
States person.

This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”),
and regulations, rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed, perhaps
retroactively, so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those summarized
below. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxes or all tax considerations
that may be relevant to U.S. holders in light of their personal circumstances. In addition, it does not represent a
detailed description of the United States federal income tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to
special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws. For example, this summary does not address:

Š tax consequences to holders who may be subject to special tax treatment, such as dealers in securities
or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their
securities, financial institutions, regulated investment companies, real estate investment trusts,
investors in partnerships or other pass-through entities for United States federal income tax purposes,
tax-exempt entities or insurance companies;

Š tax consequences to persons holding the notes as part of a hedging, integrated, constructive sale or
conversion transaction or a straddle;

Š tax consequences to holders of the notes whose “functional currency” is not the United States dollar;

Š alternative minimum tax consequences, if any; or

Š any state, local or foreign tax consequences.

If a partnership holds our notes, the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the
partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding our notes, you should
consult your tax advisors.

This summary does not contain a detailed description of all the United States federal income tax
consequences to you in light of your particular circumstances and does not address the effects of any state, local
or non-United States tax laws. If you are considering the purchase of notes, you should consult your own tax
**advisors concerning the particular United States federal income tax consequences to you of the ownership**
**of the notes, as well as the consequences to you arising under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.**


-----

Interest on a note will generally be taxable to you as ordinary income at the time it is paid or accrued in
accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes. Subject to the discussion of exchange gain and loss
below, interest income on a note generally will constitute foreign source income and for purposes of the United States
foreign tax credit, generally will be considered passive income. You will generally be denied a foreign tax credit for
foreign taxes imposed with respect to the notes where you do not meet a minimum holding period requirement during
which you are not protected from risk of loss. The rules governing the foreign tax credit are complex. You are urged to
consult your tax advisors regarding the availability of the foreign tax credit under your particular circumstances.

If you receive interest payments made in a foreign currency and you use the cash basis method of
accounting, you will be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount received, determined
by translating the foreign currency received at the “spot rate” for such foreign currency on the date such payment
is received regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted into U.S. dollars. You will not recognize
exchange gain or loss with respect to the receipt of such payment.

If you use the accrual method of accounting, you may determine the amount of income recognized with
respect to such interest in accordance with either of two methods. Under the first method, you will be required to
include in income for each taxable year the U.S. dollar value of the interest that has accrued during such year,
determined by translating such interest at the average rate of exchange for the period or periods during which
such interest accrued. Under the second method, you may elect to translate interest income at the spot rate on:

Š the last day of the accrual period,

Š the last day of the taxable year if the accrual period straddles your taxable year, or

Š the date the interest payment is received if such date is within five days of the end of the accrual
period.

Upon receipt of an interest payment on such note (including, upon the sale of a note, the receipt of
proceeds which include amounts attributable to accrued interest previously included in income), you will
recognize ordinary gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the U.S. dollar value of such
payment (determined by translating the foreign currency received at the spot rate for such foreign currency on the
date such payment is received) and the U.S. dollar value of the interest income you previously included in
income with respect to such payment.

**_Sale, Exchange and Retirement of Notes_**

Your tax basis in a note will, in general, be your U.S. dollar cost for that note. Upon the sale, exchange,
retirement or other taxable disposition of a note, you will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between
the amount realized upon the sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition of a note (less an amount equal to
any accrued interest that you did not previously include in income, which will be taxable as interest income) and
your adjusted tax basis in the note. If you purchased a note with foreign currency, your cost will be the U.S.
dollar value of the foreign currency amount paid for such note determined at the time of such purchase. If your
note is sold, exchanged or retired for an amount denominated in foreign currency, then your amount realized
generally will be based on the spot rate of the foreign currency on the date of sale, exchange or retirement. If you
are a cash method taxpayer and the notes are traded on an established securities market, foreign currency paid or
received is translated into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. An accrual
method taxpayer may elect the same treatment with respect to the purchase and sale of notes traded on an
established securities market, provided that the election is applied consistently.

Subject to the foreign currency rules discussed below, your gain or loss will be capital gain or loss and
will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of sale, exchange, retirement or other disposition, you have
held the note for more than one year. Capital gains of individuals derived in respect of capital assets held for
more than one year are eligible for reduced rates of taxation. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to
limitations. Gain or loss realized by you on the sale, exchange or retirement of a note would generally be treated
as U.S. source gain or loss.

A portion of your gain or loss with respect to the principal amount of a note may be treated as exchange
gain or loss. Exchange gain or loss will be treated as ordinary income or loss and generally will be U.S. source
gain or loss. For these purposes, the principal amount of the note is your purchase price for the note calculated in
the foreign currency on the date of purchase, and the amount of exchange gain or loss recognized is equal to the
difference between (i) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the date of the sale, exchange,
retirement or other disposition of the note and (ii) the U.S. dollar value of the principal amount determined on the
date you purchased the note. The amount of exchange gain or loss will be limited to the amount of overall gain or
loss realized on the disposition of the note.


-----

Your tax basis in the foreign currency received as interest on a note will be the U.S. dollar value thereof
at the spot rate in effect on the date the foreign currency is includible in income. Your tax basis in foreign
currency received on the sale, exchange or retirement of a foreign currency note will be equal to the U.S. dollar
value of the foreign currency, determined at the time of the sale, exchange or retirement. Any gain or loss
recognized by you on a sale, exchange or other disposition of the foreign currency will be ordinary income or
loss and generally will be United States source gain or loss.

**_Reportable Transactions_**

Treasury Regulations issued under the Code meant to require the reporting of certain tax shelter
transactions could be interpreted to cover transactions generally not regarded as tax shelters, including certain
foreign currency transactions. Under the Treasury Regulations, certain transactions are required to be reported to
the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) including, in certain circumstances, a sale, exchange, retirement or other
taxable disposition of a euro note or foreign currency received in respect of a euro note to the extent that such
sale, exchange, retirement or other taxable disposition results in a tax loss in excess of a threshold amount. If you
are considering the purchase of the notes, you should consult with your own tax advisors to determine the tax
return obligations, if any, with respect to an investment in the notes, including any requirement to file IRS Form
8886 (Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement).

**_Backup Withholding and Information Reporting_**

Generally, information reporting requirements will apply to all payments we make to you and the
proceeds from a sale of a note paid to you, unless you are an exempt recipient such as a corporation.
Additionally, if you fail to provide your taxpayer identification number, or in the case of interest payments, fail
either to report in full dividend and interest income or to make certain certifications, you may be subject to
backup withholding.

Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against
your United States federal income tax liability provided the required information is furnished to the IRS.

**Danish Income Tax Consequences**

The following summary on Danish tax issues relating to holding and disposal of the notes is of a general
nature and is based on Danish tax legislation as at the date hereof. This legislation may subsequently change. The
summary below does not purport to be a comprehensive summary of all tax aspects regarding the holding and
disposal of the notes. Particular attention should be paid to the fact that the summary does not address investors
to whom special tax rules apply, such as traders in securities (including but not limited to banks, stock brokers
and insurance companies) and investors subject to tax on return on pension investments.

**_Taxation of Investors Subject to Full Tax Liability in Denmark_**

Investors subject to full tax liability in Denmark include, but are not limited to, individuals resident in
Denmark, individuals who spend a minimum of six consecutive months in Denmark, companies incorporated in
Denmark and certain companies whose place of effective management is located in Denmark.

**_Interest_**

_Individuals_

Interest deriving from the notes is taxable and included in the capital income. Net capital income is taxed
progressively and at a maximum rate of 59% (2006).

_Companies_

Interest deriving from the notes is taxable and included in the general income. Net general income is
subject to a flat tax rate of 28% (2006).

**_Capital Gains and Losses_**

_Individuals_

Capital gains and losses deriving from notes issued in currencies other than Danish kroner (or notes
issued in Danish kroner where redemption is linked to one or more foreign currencies) are included in the capital
income, disregarding, however, gains and losses below DKK 1,000 (€134.0). Net capital income is taxed
progressively and at a maximum rate of 59% (2006)


-----

Capital gains deriving from the notes are taxable and included in the general income subject to a flat tax
rate of 28% (2006). Losses can be offset.

**_Taxation of Investors Not Subject to Full Tax Liability in Denmark_**

Generally, investors which are not related to or affiliated with the Issuer and which are not subject to full
tax liability in Denmark are not subject to Danish taxation with respect to interest income or capital gains
deriving from the notes.

If notes are held in connection with a permanent establishment in Denmark, interest or capital gains
deriving from such notes are subject to limited taxation in Denmark according to the same rules that apply to
holders of notes subject to full tax liability.

**_Stamp duty and transfer taxes_**

The purchase, disposal or sale of notes is not subject to stamp duty, transfer tax or value added tax in
Denmark.

**E.U. Income Tax Consequences**

**_E.U. Proposed Savings Directive_**

On 3 June 2003 the European Council of Economics and Finance Ministers agreed on the EU Savings
Directive under which EU member states will generally be required to provide to the tax authorities of another
EU member state details of payment of interest paid by a paying agent (as defined in the directive) within its

Each purchaser acknowledges that each note will contain a legend substantially in the following form:

“THIS NOTE HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS
AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), OR OTHER SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OR

TRANSACTION,” “UNITED STATES” AND “U.S. PERSON” HAVE THE MEANINGS GIVEN TO
THEM BY REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT.”

If you purchase notes, you will also be deemed to acknowledge that the foregoing restrictions apply to
holders of beneficial interests in these notes as well as to holders of these notes.

(1) You acknowledge that the registrar will not be required to accept for registration of transfer any
notes acquired by you, except upon presentation of evidence satisfactory to us and the registrar
that the restrictions set forth herein have been complied with.

(2) You acknowledge that:

(a) the Issuer, the Initial Purchasers and others will rely upon the truth and accuracy of your
acknowledgements, representations and agreements set forth herein and you agree that, if
any of your acknowledgements, representations or agreements herein cease to be accurate
and complete, you will notify us and the Initial Purchasers promptly in writing; and

(b) if you are acquiring any notes as fiduciary or agent for one or more investor accounts, you
represent with respect to each such account that:

(i) you have sole investment discretion; and

(ii) you have full power to make the foregoing acknowledgements, representations and
agreements.

(3) You agree that you will give to each person to whom you transfer these notes notice of any
restrictions on the transfer of the notes.

(4) If you are a purchaser in a sale that occurs outside the United States within the meaning of
Regulation S, you acknowledge that until the expiration of the “distribution compliance period”
(as defined below), you shall not make any offer or sale of these notes to a U.S. person or for the
account or benefit of a U.S. person within the meaning of Rule 902 under the U.S. Securities Act.
The “distribution compliance period” means the 40-day period following the issue date for the
notes.

(5) You understand that no action has been taken in any jurisdiction (including the United States) by
the Issuer or the Initial Purchasers that would permit a public offering of the notes or the
possession, circulation or distribution of this offering memorandum or any other material relating
to the Issuer or the notes in any jurisdiction where action for that purpose is required.
Consequently, any transfer of the notes will be subject to the selling restrictions set forth under
“Plan of Distribution.”


-----

The Issuer and the Initial Purchasers have entered into a purchase agreement dated, 2006,
with respect to the notes. Subject to certain conditions contained in the purchase agreement, the Initial Purchasers
have agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase, and the Issuer has agreed to sell, all of the notes. The
purchase agreement with respect to the notes provides that the obligation of the Initial Purchasers to purchase and
accept delivery of the notes is subject to the approval by its counsel of certain legal matters and to certain other
conditions.

The Initial Purchasers have agreed to purchase all of the notes being sold pursuant to the purchase
agreement if any of the notes are purchased. The purchase price for the notes will be the initial offering price set
forth on the cover page of this offering memorandum less an Initial Purchasers’ discount. The Initial Purchasers
propose to offer the notes at the initial offering price. After the notes are released for sale, the Initial Purchasers
may change the offering price and other selling terms.

The notes have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial Purchasers
have agreed that they will only offer or sell the notes (1) outside the United States in offshore transactions in
reliance on Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act and (2) in the United States to QIBs in reliance on Rule
144A. The terms used above have the meanings given to them by Regulation S and Rule 144A.

In connection with the sales outside the United States, the Initial Purchasers have agreed that they will not
offer, sell or deliver the notes to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons (1) as part of the Initial
Purchasers’ distribution at any time or (2) otherwise until 40 days after the later of the commencement of this
offering or the date the notes were originally issued. Each Initial Purchaser will send to each dealer to whom it
sells such notes during such 40-day period a confirmation or other notice setting forth the restrictions on offers
and sales of the notes within the United States by a dealer or to, or for the account or benefit of, U.S. persons.

In addition, until 40 days after the commencement of the offering, an offer or sale of any notes within the
United States by any dealer (whether or not participating in the offering) may violate the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act if such offer or sale is made otherwise than in accordance with Rule
144A or pursuant to another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act.

Delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefore on or about the [ ] business day following
the date of pricing of the notes (such settlement being referred to as “T+[ ]”). Under Rule 15(c)6-1 under the U.S.
Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days unless the
parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on the
date of pricing or the next [ ] succeeding business days will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes will
initially settle in T+[ ], to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent failed
settlement. Purchasers of the notes who wish to trade the notes on the date of pricing or the next [ ] succeeding
business days should consult their own advisors.

In connection with the offering, the Initial Purchasers (or persons acting on their behalf) may purchase
and sell notes in the open market. These transactions may include short sales, stabilizing transactions and
purchases to cover positions created by short sales. Short sales involve the sale by the Initial Purchasers of a
greater number of notes than they are required to purchase in the offering. Stabilizing transactions consist of
certain bids or purchases made for the purpose of preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the
notes while the offering is in progress.

These activities by the Initial Purchasers (or persons acting on their behalf) may stabilize, maintain or
otherwise affect the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that
otherwise might exist in the open market. If these activities are commenced, they may be discontinued by the
Initial Purchasers at any time. These transactions may be effected in the over-the-counter market or otherwise.

Each of the Initial Purchasers also agrees that: (1) it has complied and will comply with all applicable
provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”) with respect to anything done by it in
relation to the notes in, from, or otherwise involving the United Kingdom; and (2) it has only communicated or
caused to be communicated, and will only communicate or cause to be communicated, any invitation or
inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of Section 21 of the FSMA) received by it in
connection with the issue or sale of any of the notes in circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does
not apply to us.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United States, by us or the Initial Purchasers
that would permit a public offering of the notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering
memorandum or any other material relating to us or the notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is
required Accordingly the notes may not be offered or sold directly or indirectly and neither this offering

purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell in any jurisdiction where such offer or solicitation would be unlawful.
Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to inform themselves about and to
observe any restrictions relating to the offering of the notes, the distribution of this offering memorandum and
resale of the notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

The Issuer has agreed to indemnify the Initial Purchasers against certain liabilities, including liabilities
under the U.S. Securities Act. The Issuer will pay the fees and expenses related to this offering.

The Issuer has agreed in the purchase agreement that, for a period of 90 days from the date of the final
offering memorandum, it will not, nor will any of its subsidiaries or affiliates: (i) offer for sale, sell, contract to
sell, grant an option for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of, directly or indirectly, any other debt securities issued
or granted by the Issuer or any of its subsidiaries or affiliates (other than the notes) or securities of the Issuer or
any of its subsidiaries that are convertible into, or exchangeable with the notes or such other debt securities.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and/or their respective affiliates have from time to time performed certain
investment banking and other financial services for us and our affiliates. Affiliates of the Initial Purchasers are
lenders to us, including, under indebtedness that will be repaid out of the proceeds of the offering. Each Initial
Purchaser is also a lender and mandated lead arranger under our Senior Credit Facilities and is a lender under the
Bridge Facility. The Initial Purchasers have agreed to credit against the fees payable to them under the purchase
agreement certain amounts paid to them or their affiliates in connection with the Bridge Facility. Each Initial
Purchaser (other than Nordea Bank Danmark A/S) also underwrote the sale of equity interests to be syndicated to
certain co-investors in combination with loans under our PIK Facility, which equity interests were not
repurchased when the PIK Facility was repaid. In addition, each Initial Purchaser and its affiliates may in the
future provide investment banking or other financial services to us. J.P. Morgan plc, Deutsche Bank AG, London
Branch and Nordea Bank Danmark A/S also acted as advisors to the Purchaser in relation to the Tender Offer.
An affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, will act as the trustee under the Indenture and an affiliate of
J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. is acting as security agent under the Senior Credit Facility, the Bridge Facility and

The Issuer is incorporated under the laws of Denmark and none of our directors or executive officers are
residents of the United States. Furthermore, a substantial portion of the Issuer’s assets and a substantial portion of
the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may not be possible for investors to
effect service of process within the United States upon the Issuer or those persons, or to enforce against them
judgments of U.S. courts predicated upon the civil liability provisions of U.S. Federal or state securities laws.

If a judgment is obtained in a U.S. court against the Issuer or any such persons, investors will need to
enforce such judgment in jurisdictions where the Issuer or such person has assets. Under applicable Danish law, a
judgment by a state or Federal court of the United States in respect of the notes or the Indenture will neither be
recognized nor enforced by the courts of Denmark without a review of the merits underlying the judgment. You
should consult with your own advisers in any pertinent jurisdictions as needed to enforce a judgment in those
countries or elsewhere outside the United States.

_“Broadband” refers to a type of connection to exchange data at a higher speed than through analog lines._
The most common broadband technologies are cable modem, DSL, wireless and optical fiber.

for a period by the average number of customers for such period. The average number of customers for a period
is calculated by adding the number of customers at the beginning of such period to the number of customers at
the end of such period and dividing by two. In general, we calculate churn using external gross decrease.
However, internal migration between TDC Mobile A/S and Telmore is included in churn figures. Hence, internal
migration will be recorded as higher churn. Different telecommunications companies calculate churn in different
manners.

someone else’s network).

_“On-net” refers to a telephone call originated, transmitted and terminated on the same operator’s_
network.

_“PABC” or “Privat Automatisk Bi-Central” refers to a Danish translation of the English term PABX_
(Private Automatic Branch Exchange) which is an automatic telephone switching system within a private
enterprise. Originally, such systems - called private branch exchanges (PBX) - required the use of a live operator.

**Note 1** **Significant Accounting Policies**

The Consolidated Financial Statements 2005 of TDC have been prepared in accordance with the
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union and additional Danish
disclosure requirements for annual reports of listed companies. The additional Danish disclosure requirements
are provided in the IFRS Executive Order issued by the Danish Commerce and Companies Agency in pursuance
of the Danish Financial Statements Act. The Consolidated Financial Statements of TDC have also been prepared
in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) issued by IASB.

These Consolidated Financial Statements are the first to be prepared in accordance with IFRS. When
adopting these standards we have applied IFRS 1 on the presentation of first-time financial statements under
IFRS.

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been based on the historical cost convention. When
preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements, Management makes assumptions that affect the reported
amount of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported revenue and expenses during the
accounting period. The accounting estimates and judgments considered material to the preparation of the
Consolidated Financial Statements appear from note 2 below.

**_Changes in accounting policies_**

In accordance with IFRS 1, the opening balance sheets at January 1, 2004 and comparative figures for
2004 have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs/IASs and IFRICs/ SICs effective at December 31, 2005. The
opening balance sheets at January 1, 2004 have been prepared as if these standards and interpretations had
always been applied, except for the specific transition and implementation provisions described below.
Comparative figures and selected financial and operational data for previous years have been restated
accordingly.

The accounting policies have been changed in relation to:

Š **Goodwill — Goodwill is no longer amortized. Previously, goodwill was amortized over the estimated**
economic life. Goodwill amortization was discontinued with retroactive effect from January 1, 2002.
Since this date, TDC has performed impairment tests annually and if events or changes in
circumstances indicate that an asset is impaired

Š **Pensions — Pension costs relating to defined benefit plans are now calculated in accordance with**
IAS 19. Previously, such costs were calculated in accordance with US GAAP FAS Nos. 87-88. The
recognition of pensions has been changed with retroactive effect from January 1, 2004. In accordance
with IFRS 1, unrecognized actuarial losses are recognized directly in equity. TDC still applies the
corridor method for recognizing actuarial gains and losses incurred after January 1, 2004. In addition,
in the Opening Balance Sheets at January 1, 2004, unrecognized transition obligation arising in
connection with the implementation of FAS 87 and unrecognized prior service cost have been
recognized. Previously, these liabilities were recognized in the Statements of Income by amortization
over the average expected remaining service lives of the employees concerned

Š **Share-based payment — The value of services received from employees as compensation for**
incentives is recognized in the Statements of Income over the vesting period and is measured at the
fair value at the grant date of the share options. Previously, no expenses relating to share-based
payment were recognized, except for any differences between the market price of TDC A/S’s shares at
the grant date and the exercise price of the share-based incentives recognized over the vesting period
as wages, salaries and pension costs

Š **Indirect production costs related to development projects — Certain indirect production costs**
related to development projects, including computer software, are expensed. Previously, such costs
were capitalized and amortized over their estimated economic lives

Š **Jubilee benefits — Jubilee benefits provided for employees are recognized in the Statements of**
Income over the vesting period. Previously, such benefits were expensed as paid

Š **Sale and leaseback agreements with pension funds — Gains from the sale of property to pension**
funds related to TDC and subsequent lease expenses resulting from such agreements are not


-----

**Note 1** **Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

recognized. The properties are recognized in the Balance Sheets as assets and the amount payable to
the pension funds as liabilities. Previously, the resulting gains were recognized in the Statements of
Income at the date of the sales agreement, and the lease payments were expensed

Š **Currency adjustments regarding translation of foreign enterprises’ financial statements —**
Currency adjustments regarding translation of foreign enterprises’ statements of income and balance
sheets are as previously recognized directly in equity under a separate reserve. In accordance with
IFRS 1, currency translation adjustments occurring before January 1, 2004 are not recognized in this
reserve

Besides changes in accounting policies, the following reclassifications and changes of reporting format
have been made:

Š **Statements of Income — ‘Work performed for own purposes and capitalized’ is no longer included**
as revenue. The related cost items are reduced correspondingly. Previously, Work performed for own
purposes and capitalized was included as income at an amount corresponding to the costs incurred.
These costs were included under the respective items in the Statements of Income. A new item ‘Other
income and expenses’ includes income, which was previously included under ‘Other operating
income’, as well as losses from e.g. the sale of non-current assets, which were previously included
under ‘Other external expenses’. And ‘Income from associates’ is now shown net after corporate
income taxes and comprises special items related to associates. Previously, income taxes in associates
were included under ‘Income taxes’ and special items concerning associates were included under the
separate item ‘Special items’

Š **Balance Sheets — The classification of assets and liabilities as non-current or current assets, as well**
as non-current or current liabilities, respectively, has been changed in some respects. Deferred tax
liabilities, pensions and similar liabilities as well as provisions are no longer presented as a separate
main category in the Balance Sheets, but are included under current or non-current liabilities

Š **Statements of Cash Flow — ‘Cash and cash equivalents’ now comprises only cash and marketable**
securities with an insignificant risk of changes in value. An insignificant risk is assumed to exist when
the remaining life does not exceed three months at the time of purchase. Therefore, purchase and sale
of securities with a remaining life exceeding 3 months at the time of purchase are reclassified to cash
flow from investing activities. Previously, cash and cash equivalents included all securities

Except for the changes mentioned above, accounting policies are unchanged from last year.

**_Consolidation policies_**

The Consolidated Financial Statements include the Financial Statements of the Parent Company and
subsidiaries in which TDC A/S has a direct or indirect controlling influence. Associates in which the Group has a
significant influence are recognized using the equity method.

The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the basis of the Financial Statements of
TDC A/S and its consolidated enterprises, which have been restated to Group accounting policies combining
items of a uniform nature.

On consolidation, intra-group income and expenses, shareholdings, dividends, internal balances and
realized and unrealized profits and losses on transactions between the consolidated enterprises have been
eliminated.

On acquisition of subsidiaries and associates, the purchase method is applied, and acquired assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities are measured on initial recognition at fair values on the date of acquisition.
Identifiable intangible assets are recognized if they can be separated and the fair value can be reliably measured.
Deferred tax of the revaluation made is recognized.

Any remaining positive differences between cost and fair value of the assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities acquired on acquisition of subsidiaries are recognized in the Balance Sheets under Intangible assets as
goodwill. Positive differences on acquisition of associates are recognized in the Balance Sheets under
Investments in associates. Goodwill is not amortized, but tested annually for impairment.

Acquired enterprises are recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements from the time of
acquisition, whereas divested enterprises are recognized up to the time of disposal. However, enterprises that
meet the criteria for discontinued operations are presented separately


-----

**Note 1** **Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

Gains and losses related to disposal of subsidiaries and associates are recognized as the difference
between the proceeds and the carrying value of net assets with the addition of goodwill and accumulated
currency translation adjustments recognized in equity at the time of disposal with the addition of disposal
expenses.

**_Foreign currency translation_**

A functional currency is determined for each of the Group’s enterprises. The functional currency is the
currency applied in the primary economic environment of each enterprise’s operations. Transactions in
currencies other than the functional currency are transactions in foreign currencies. The Consolidated Financial
Statements are presented in Danish kroner (DKK), which is the Parent Company’s functional and presentation
currency.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the transaction-date rates of exchange. Foreign
exchange gains and losses arising from differences between the transaction-date rates and the rates at the date of
settlement are recognized as net financials in the Statements of Income.

Cash, marketable securities, loans and other amounts receivable or payable in foreign currencies are
translated into Danish kroner at the official rates of exchange quoted at the balance sheet date. Currency
translation adjustments are recognized as net financials in the Statements of Income.

The balance sheets and group goodwill of consolidated foreign enterprises are translated into Danish
kroner at the official rates of exchange quoted at the balance sheet date, whereas the statements of income of the
enterprises are translated into Danish kroner at monthly average rates of exchange. Currency translation
adjustments arising from the translation of equity at the beginning of the year into Danish kroner at the official
rates of exchange quoted at the balance sheet date are recognized directly in equity under a separate reserve for
currency translation adjustments. This also applies to adjustments arising from the translation of the statements
of income from the monthly average rates of exchange to the rates of exchange quoted at the balance sheet date.

Currency translation adjustments of receivables from foreign subsidiaries and associates that are
considered to be part of the overall investment in the enterprise are recognized directly in equity.

**_Derivative financial instruments_**

On initial recognition, derivative financial instruments are recognized in the Balance Sheets on inception
at fair values and subsequently remeasured also at fair values. Quoted market prices are used for derivative
financial instruments traded in an active market. A number of different, recognized measurement methods,
depending on type of instrument, are applied for derivative financial instruments not traded in an active market.
Measurement of financial assets is based on bid prices, and offer prices are applied for financial liabilities.

Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments that qualify as hedges of future cash flows
are recognized directly in equity net of tax. Gains and losses from hedges of future cash flows are transferred
from equity and are as a general rule recognized in the same item as the hedged transaction when the cash flow is
realized (for example when the hedged sale has been effected). If the hedged transaction results in recognition of
a non-monetary item (such as inventories) or a liability, gains or losses from equity are, however, included in the
cost of the asset or liability.

Fair value changes of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are
recognized immediately in the Statements of Income.

Changes in the fair values of derivative financial instruments that qualify as net investment hedges in
foreign subsidiaries or associates, and that effectively hedge exchange rate changes in these enterprises, are
recognized directly in equity net of tax.

**_Revenue recognition_**

Revenue comprises goods and services provided during the year after deduction of VAT and rebates
relating directly to sales.

The significant sources of revenue are recognized in the Statements of Income as follows:

Š Revenue from telephony is recorded at the time the call is made

Š Sales related to pre-paid products are deferred and revenue is recognized at the time of use


-----

**Note 1** **Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

Š Revenue from leased lines is recognized over the rental period

Š Revenue from subscription fees is recognized over the subscription period

Š Revenue from non-refundable up-front connection fees is deferred and amortized over the expected
term of the related customer relationship

Š Revenue from printed directories is recognized when the directory is distributed. Revenue from online
directory services is recognized over the period during which the services are provided

Š Revenue from the sale of equipment is recognized on delivery. Revenue from the maintenance of
equipment is recognized over the contract period

Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are recognized as separate units of accounting,
independent of any contingent element related to the delivery of additional items or other performance
conditions.

Revenue is recognized gross when TDC acts as principal in a transaction. For agreements involving the
resale of third-party services in which TDC acts as agent, revenue is recognized net of direct costs.

The percentage of completion method is used to recognize revenue from contract work in process based
on an assessment of the stage of completion.

**_Share options_**

The value of services received from employees as compensation for incentives is measured at the grant
date at the fair value of the share options granted and is recognized over the vesting period in the Statements of
Income under wages, salaries and pension costs. The set-off item is recognized directly in equity.

For initial recognition of share options, the number of options that employees are expected to be entitled
to is based on an estimate. Changes in the estimated number of legally acquired options are subsequently
adjusted so that the total recognition is based on the actual number of legally acquired options.

Calculations of fair values of share options granted have been based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model, taking into account the terms and conditions attached to the granted share options.

**_Employee shares_**

When employees are given the opportunity of purchasing shares at a price below market price, the
discount is recognized as a cost under wages, salaries and pension costs at the time of acquisition. The set-off
item is recognized directly in equity. The discount is measured at the time of acquisition as the difference
between fair value and purchase price.

**_Special items_**

Special items include significant amounts that cannot be attributed to normal operations such as large
gains and losses related to divestment of subsidiaries, which do not qualify as discontinued operations in
accordance with IFRS 5, special write-downs for impairment of intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment as well as provisions for restructuring etc. and any reversals of such.

**_Research_**

Research costs are expensed as incurred. Contributions received from third parties in connection with
research projects are recognized as income concurrently with the incurrence of related expenses.

**_Intangible assets_**

Goodwill is recognized at cost less accumulated write-downs. As of January 1, 2002, goodwill is no
longer amortized. The carrying value of goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever events or
changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable, and is subsequently written
down to the recoverable amount in the Statements of Income if exceeded by the carrying value.

Licenses, customer-related assets, proprietary rights, patents, etc. are measured at cost less accumulated
amortization and impairment losses and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic
lives


-----

**Note 1** **Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

Development projects, including costs of computer software purchased or developed for internal use, are
recognized as intangible assets if the cost can be calculated reliably and if they are expected to generate future
economic benefits. Costs of development projects include wages, external charges, depreciation and amortization
that are directly attributable to the development activities as well as interest expenses in the production period.
Development projects that do not meet the criteria for recognition in the Balance Sheets are expensed as incurred
in the Statements of Income.

The main amortization periods are as follows:

UMTS licenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 12-16 years
Other licenses . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-10 years
Customer-related assets . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-5 years
Other rights, etc. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2-26 years
Development projects . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-5 years

Development projects in process and intangible assets of indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment
at least annually and written down to recoverable amount in the Statements of Income.

Intangible assets are recorded at the lower of recoverable amount or carrying value.

**_Property, plant and equipment_**

Property, plant and equipment, including improvements, are measured at cost less accumulated
depreciation and write-down for impairment.

Cost comprises purchase price and costs directly attributable to the acquisition until the date on which the
asset is ready for use. The cost of self-constructed assets includes direct and indirect payroll costs, materials,
parts purchased and services rendered by sub-suppliers or contractors, indirect production costs as well as interest
expenses in the construction period. Cost also includes estimated asset retirement costs if the related obligation
meets the conditions for recognition as a provision.

Indirect production costs comprise wages, salarie and pension costs together with other external expenses
calculated in terms of time consumed on self-constructed assets in the relevant departments.

The depreciation base is measured while observing the asset’s residual value less any write-downs. The
residual value is reviewed regularly. If the residual value exceeds the asset’s carrying value, depreciation is
discontinued. Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The
main depreciation periods are as follows:

Buildings . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20 years
Telecommunications installations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5-20 years
Other installations . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3-8 years

Non-current assets that have been disposed of or scrapped are eliminated from accumulated cost and
accumulated depreciation. Gains and losses arising from sale of property, plant and equipment are measured as
the difference between the sales price less selling expenses and the carrying value at the time of sale. The
resulting gain or loss is recognized in the Statements of Income under Other income and expenses.

Software that is an integral part of for example telephone exchange installations is presented together
with the related assets. Useful lives are estimated individually.

Installation materials are measured at the lower of weighted average cost and recoverable amount.

Leased property, plant and equipment that qualify as capital leases are recognized as assets acquired. The
cost of capital leases are measured at the lower of the assets’ fair value and the present value of future minimum
lease payments. Lease payments on operating leases are accrued and expensed over the term of the lease.

Property, plant and equipment are recognized at the lower of recoverable amount and carrying value.

**_Investments in associates_**

Investments in associates are recognized under the equity method.

A proportional share of the enterprises’ income after income taxes is recognized in the Statements of
Income Proportional shares of intra-group profits and losses are eliminated


-----

**Note 1** **Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

Investments in associates are recognized in the Balance Sheets at the proportional share of the associate’s
equity value calculated in accordance with Group accounting policies with addition of goodwill.

Associates with negative equity value are measured at DKK 0, and any receivables from these enterprises
are written down by the share of the negative equity value. If a legal or constructive obligation exists to cover the
associate’s negative balance, a provision for that obligation is recognized.

**_Minority passive investments_**

Interest-bearing securities are classified as loans and receivables and are recognized at amortized cost.
Annual amortization is recognized as interest income.

Other investments whose fair value cannot be reliably determined are classified as available for sale and
recognized at cost. When a reliable fair value is determinable, such investments are measured accordingly, and
fair value adjustments are recognized in the Statements of Income.

**_Inventories_**

Inventories are measured at the lower of weighted average cost and net realizable value. The cost of
merchandise covers purchase price and delivery costs.

**_Receivables_**

Receivables are measured at amortized cost. Write-downs for anticipated uncollectibles are based on
individual assessments of major receivables and historically experienced write-down for anticipated losses on
other receivables.

**_Contract work in process_**

Contract work in process is measured at the selling price of the work performed and recognized under
receivables. The selling price is measured at cost of own labor, materials, etc., the share of indirect production
costs and the addition of a share of the profit based on the stage of completion. The stage of completion is
measured by comparing costs incurred to date with the estimated total costs for each contract.

Write-downs are made for anticipated losses on work in process based on assessments of estimated losses
on the individual contracts through to completion.

Payments on account are offset against the value of the individual contract to the extent that such billing
does not exceed the amount capitalized. Received payments on account exceeding the amount capitalized are
recognized under prepayments from customers.

**_Marketable securities_**

Marketable securities recognized under current assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date.
All fair value adjustments (except principal repayments) are recognized in the Statements of Income.

**_Treasury shares_**

The cost of treasury shares is deducted from equity under retained earnings on the date of acquisition.
Payments received in connection with the disposal of treasury shares are similarly recognized directly in equity.

**_Dividends_**

Dividends expected to be distributed for the year are recognized under a separate item in equity.
Dividends are recognized as a liability at the time of adoption by the annual general meeting.

**_Currency translation reserve_**

Currency translation reserve comprises exchange rate differences arising from translation into Danish
kroner of the functional currency of foreign enterprises’ financial statements. Translation adjustments are
recognized in the Statements of Income when the net investment is realized.

On the preparation of the opening balance sheets at January 1, 2004, currency translation adjustments
occurring before January 1, 2004 have not been recognized in the currency translation reserve in accordance with
IFRS 1.


-----

**Note 1** **Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

**_Pensions_**

The Group’s pension plans include defined benefit plans and defined contribution plans.

The Group has an obligation to pay a specific benefit to defined benefit plans at the time of retirement. A
pension asset or pension obligation corresponding to the present value of the obligations less the defined pension
plans’ assets and adjustment for unrecognized actuarial gains and losses is recognized for these benefit plans.

The obligations are determined annually by independent actuaries using the “Projected Unit Credit
Method” assuming that each year of service gives rise to an additional unit of benefit entitlement, and each unit is
measured separately to build up the final obligations.

Estimation of future obligations is based on the Group’s projected future developments in mortality, early
retirement, future wages, salaries and benefit levels, interest rate, etc. The defined pension plans’ assets are
estimated at fair value at the balance sheet date.

Differences between the projected and realized developments in pension assets and pension obligations
are referred to as actuarial gains and losses. In connection with the adoption of IFRS, accumulated actuarial gains
and losses are fully recognized in the opening balance sheets at January 1, 2004. If the value of subsequent
accumulated actuarial gains and losses at the beginning of a fiscal year exceeds 10% of the higher of the pension
obligations’ value and the fair value of the pension plans’ assets, the excess amount is recognized in the
Statements of Income in accordance with the corridor method over the projected average remaining service lives
of the employees concerned. Actuarial gains and losses not exceeding the above-mentioned limits are not
recognized, but disclosed in the notes.

Estimated net assets are recognized if they offset unrecognized actuarial losses, future repayments from
the pension plan, or if future payments to the plan are reduced.

In case of changes in benefits relating to employees’ previous service period, a change in the estimated
present value of the pension obligations will occur, which will be recognized immediately if the employees have
acquired a final right to these changed benefits. If not, the change is recognized over the period in which the
employees become entitled to the changed benefit.

For the pension plan for former civil servants, the onetime payment in 1994 to the Danish government is
recognized in the Statements of Income over the expected remaining service lives of the employees concerned.

For the defined contribution plans, the Group will pay in a fixed periodic contribution to separate legal
entities and will have no further obligations after the payment has been made. Recognition in the Statements of
Income is made in the vesting period.

**_Current and deferred corporate income taxes_**

Tax for the year comprises current tax, changes in deferred tax and adjustments from prior years.

Current tax liabilities and current tax receivables are recognized in the Balance Sheets as tax payable or
tax receivable.

Deferred tax is measured under the balance-sheet liability method on the basis of all temporary
differences between the carrying values and the tax bases of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date except
for temporary differences arising from goodwill where amortization for tax purposes is disallowed. Tax
computed on expected dividends from associates is also recognized as deferred tax.

Deferred tax assets including the tax value of tax loss carry-forwards are recognized at the value at which
they are expected to be realized. Realization is expected to be effected either by elimination in tax on future
earnings or by set-off against deferred tax liabilities within the same legal tax entity.

Adjustment of deferred tax is made concerning elimination of unrealized intra-group profits and losses.

Deferred tax is measured on the basis of the tax rules and tax rates in the respective countries that will be
effective under the legislation at the balance sheet date when the deferred tax is expected to be realized as current
tax. Changes in deferred tax as a result of changes in tax rates are recognized in the Statements of Income.

**_Provisions_**

Provisions are recognized when — as a consequence of an event occurring before or on the balance sheet
date — the Group has a legal or constructive obligation, where it is probable that economic benefits must be
sacrificed to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably


-----

**Note 1** **Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

Provisions for restructuring etc. are recognized when a final decision thereon has been made before or on
the balance sheet date and has been announced to the parties involved, provided that the amount can be measured
reliably. Provisions for restructuring are based on a defined plan, which means that the restructuring is
commenced immediately after the decision has been made.

When the Group is under an obligation to demolish an asset or re-establish the site where the asset was
used, a liability corresponding to the present value of estimated future costs is recognized in the Statements of
Income.

**_Financial liabilities_**

Interest-bearing loans are recognized initially at the proceeds received net of transaction expenses
incurred. In subsequent periods, loans are measured at amortized cost so that the difference between the proceeds
and the nominal value is recognized in the Statements of Income over the term of the loan.

Other financial liabilities are measured at amortized cost.

**_Deferred income_**

Deferred income recognized as liabilities comprises payments received covering income in subsequent
years.

**_Disclosure of discontinued operations_**

Discontinued operations constitute entities comprising separate major lines of business or geographical
areas, whose activities and cash flows for operating and accounting purposes can be clearly distinguished from
the rest of the entity, and where the entity has been disposed of or classified as held for sale, and it seems highly
probable that the disposal is expected to be effected within twelve months in accordance with a single
coordinated plan.

Income/loss after tax of discontinued operations is presented in a separate line in the Statements of
Income with restated comparative figures. Revenue, costs and taxes relating to the discontinued operation are
disclosed in the notes. Assets and accompanying liabilities are presented in separate lines in the Balance Sheets
without restated comparative figures, and the principal items are specified in a note.

Cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities of discontinued operations are presented in
separate lines in the Statements of Cash Flow with restated comparative figures.

**_Statements of Cash Flow_**

Cash flow from operating activities is presented under the indirect method and is based on earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for non-cash operating items, cash flow from
special items for the year, changes in working capital, interest received and paid as well as income taxes paid.

Cash flow from investing activities comprises acquisition and divestment of enterprises, purchase and
sale of intangible assets, property, plant and equipment as well as other non-current assets, and purchase and sale
of securities that are not recognized as cash and cash equivalents. Cash flows from acquired enterprises are
recognized from the time of acquisition, while cash flows from enterprises disposed of are recognized up to the
time of disposal.

Cash flow from financing activities comprises changes in interest-bearing debt, purchase of treasury
shares and dividends to shareholders.

Cash and cash equivalents cover cash and marketable securities with a remaining life not exceeding
3 months at the time of acquisition, and with an insignificant risk of changes in value.

**_Segment reporting_**

Segment information is disclosed in respect of business activities and geographical markets. The
segmentation is based on the segments’ risk profile and the Group’s internal financial reporting system.

Segment assets comprise assets directly attributable to the segments, including intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment, inventories, as well as trade and other receivables.

Segment liabilities cover liabilities that result from the segments’ operating activities, including pension
liabilities, provisions, prepayments from customers, trade and other payables and deferred income.


-----

**Note 1** **Significant Accounting Policies (continued)**

**_United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP)_**

As a consequence of the registration of American Depository Shares (ADSs) with the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Group has prepared a summary of the effect on net income and equity
as if the Consolidated Financial Statements had been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States.

**Note 2** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments**

The preparation of TDC’s Annual Report requires Management to make assumptions that affect the
reported amount of assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the fiscal period. Estimates and judgments used in the determination of reported results are
continuously evaluated.

Estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed
to be reasonable in the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions
or conditions. Full details of our Significant Accounting Policies are set out in note 1. The following estimates
and judgments are considered important when portraying our financial condition:

Š Useful lives for non-current assets are assigned based on periodic studies of actual useful lives and the
intended use for those assets. Such studies are completed or updated when new events occur that have
the potential to impact the determination of the useful life of the asset, such as when events or
circumstances have occurred that indicate the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable and
should therefore be tested for impairment. Any change in the estimated useful lives of these assets is
recognized in the financial statements as soon as any such change is determined. The estimated useful
lives of certain types of buildings, telecommunications installations, other installations and software
were changed in 2005. These changes have reduced depreciation and amortization by DKK 71m

Š Intangible assets, including goodwill and other rights, comprise a significant portion of our total
assets. Impairment tests on these intangible assets are performed at least annually and, if necessary,
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable.
The measurement of intangibles is a complex process that requires significant Management judgment
in determining various assumptions, such as cash-flow projections, discount rate and terminal growth
rates. The sensitivity of the estimated measurement to these assumptions, combined or individually,
can be significant. Furthermore, the use of different estimates or assumptions when determining the
fair values of such assets may result in different values and could result in impairment charges in
future periods. The assumptions for significant goodwill amounts are set out in note 15

Š Net periodic pension cost for defined benefit plans is estimated based on certain actuarial
assumptions, the most significant of which relate to returns on plan assets, discount rate, wage
inflation and demography (mortality, disability, etc.). As shown in note 29, both the assumed rate of
return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate have been reduced in 2005 to reflect changes in
market conditions and in the mix of assets held by our pension funds. Our assumptions for 2006
reflect a further reduction in the discount rate from 4.50% to 4.30%, and unchanged assumptions for
wage inflation and assumed return on plan assets. We believe these assumptions illustrate current
market conditions and expectations for market returns in the long term. The demographic assumptions
used for 2005 reflect an expected longer life than previously assumed. With these changed
assumptions, TDC’s total pension costs excluding redundancy programs are expected to increase
approximately DKK 10m in 2006 compared with 2005, assuming all other factors remain unchanged

Š Estimates of deferred income taxes and significant items giving rise to the deferred assets and
liabilities are shown in note 12. These reflect the assessment of actual future taxes to be paid on items
in the financial statements, giving consideration to both the timing and probability of these estimates.
In addition, such estimates reflect expectations about the amount of future taxable income and, where
applicable, tax planning strategies. Actual income taxes and net income could vary from these
estimates as a result of changes in expectations about future taxable income, future changes in income
tax law or results from the final review of our tax returns by tax authorities

Š The determination of the treatment of contingent assets and liabilities in the financial statements is
based on the expected outcome of the applicable contingency. Legal counsel and other experts are
consulted both within and outside the Company An asset or a liability is recognized if the certainty or


-----

**Note 2** **Critical accounting estimates and judgments (continued)**

likelihood of a positive or adverse outcome is probable of occurring and the amount is estimable. If
not, we disclose the matter. Resolution of such matters in future periods may result in realized gains or
losses deviating from the amounts recognized

Š Estimates of the fair values of financial instruments (including derivative financial instruments) for
which quoted market prices are not available are based on the best information available in the
circumstances. Methods of recognition used for such purposes include discounting estimated expected
future cash flows, and fundamental analysis. Such methods incorporate assumptions about discount
rate, risk premium, default, prepayment, volatility and other factors

Š Revenue is recognized when realized or realizable and earned. Revenue from non-refundable up-front
connection fees is deferred and recognized as income over the expected term of the related customer
relationship. The term is estimated using historical customer churn rates. Change of Management
estimates may have a significant impact on the amount and timing of our revenue for any period

**Note 3** **New accounting standards**

IASB and the EU have approved the following new accounting standards that become effective for 2006
or later, and are judged relevant for TDC:

Š IAS 19 Employee Benefits is effective for fiscal years starting on January 1, 2006 or later. This
revised standard introduces an option for actuarial gains and losses to be recognized in equity, just as
the standard requires detailed note disclosures on defined benefit plans and similar obligations. TDC
does not expect to use the equity recognition option and intends to proceed with the recognition of
actuarial gains/losses according to the corridor method in 2006. Furthermore, TDC does not expect the
standard to result in any changes in the scope of note disclosures in the Annual Report

Š IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement including the provisions for the use of
the fair value option will become effective for fiscal years starting on January 1, 2006 or later. The
standard limits situations where the fair value adjustments can be recognized in the statement of
income. TDC does not expect this change to be of any material significance to the recognition of fair
value adjustments in the Statements of Income in 2006

Š IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures and Amendments to IAS 1 Presentations of Financial
Statements: Capital Disclosures is effective for fiscal years starting on January 1, 2007 or later. The
implementation of the standard will have no impact on the recognition and measurement of financial
instruments, and TDC does not expect the standard to result in any changes in the scope of disclosures
of financial instruments in the Annual Report

**Note 6** **Wages, salaries and pension costs (continued)**

Remuneration for 2005 includes discretionary remuneration for Henning Dyremose and Hans Munk
Nielsen for an extraordinary workload in connection with Nordic Telephone Company ApS’ equity tender offer
for acquiring the Company according to the Statement from the Board of Directors of TDC A/S dated
December 2, 2005.

The Executive Committee’s contracts include notices of 12-18 months in the event of termination by the
Company. In the event of change of control of the Company, the members of the Executive Committee are
entitled to 36 months’ salary for a period of 24 months from the change of control, plus pensions as well as
compensation for benefits, bonuses and share options. The Executive Committee has the right to exercise this
provision as of the fourth month and until six months following the first change of control of the Company after
November 30, 2005.

**_Share-option program for certain employees in Danish enterprises_**

To date, TDC has had a revolving share-option program for employees in TDC’s Danish enterprises. The
present share-option program is not expected to continue after Nordic Telephone Company ApS has acquired
control of the Company.

In connection with Nordic Telephone Company ApS’ equity tender offer for acquiring the Company,
TDC A/S has given share-option holders in Danish enterprises an opportunity to exercise these options and has
offered to buy certain existing share options. Furthermore, TDC A/S has offered share-option holders employed
in foreign subsidiaries cash settlement of existing share options. The offers are conditional on completion of the
equity offer.

TDC’s revolving share-option program comprised about 200 managers employed in Denmark and
stationed in TDC’s foreign enterprises. After the Earnings Release for the year has been published, share options
are granted to participants in accordance with contracts of employment. Each share option gives the holder the
right to purchase one share. The number of options allocated was based on an agreed percentage of the
employee’s basic salary and a calculated price per option (number of options = basic salary times option
percentage divided by price per option). The option percentage varies for the different employees within a range
of 20-35%. In addition, share options are granted on an individual basis in special cases. The option price was
calculated at the time of granting using the Black-Scholes formula. The share option exercise price was
determined as TDC’s share price on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange on the grant date.

One third of the options granted for a given year may be exercised one year after the granting, another
third one year later, and the last third one year after that. Share options may, however, be exercised in the event
of change of control of the Company. Share options that are not exercised within ten years of granting are
canceled.

Share options were also granted to the members of the Executive Committee according to the abovementioned principles.

Until 2003, the Chairman of the Board received 2,500 share options a year, and other Danish members of
the Board received 500 share options annually. Board members will no longer receive share options.

**_Bonus program_**

Around 300 top managers participate in a bonus program called the Top Managers’ Compensation
Program, and around 2,200 managers and specialists participate in a bonus program called the Managers’
Compensation Program.

The bonus program is based on specific, individual annual targets including personal, financial and
operational targets. These targets depend on the organizational position within the Group and are weighted in
accordance with specific rules. All targets must support improved profitability and business development at
TDC.

Bonus payments are calculated as the individual employee’s basic salary times the bonus percentage
times the degree of target fulfillment. The bonus percentage achieved when targets are met is called the on-target
bonus percentage. For the Top Managers’ Compensation Program, this percentage is fixed in the contract of
employment with the individual employee and usually varies within a range of 10-25%. The on-target bonus
percentage is somewhat lower for the Managers’ Compensation Program. In 2005, the bonus could be maximum
200% of the on-target bonus


-----

**Note 6** **Wages, salaries and pension costs (continued)**

The bonus program for the members of the Executive Committee is based on the same principles as those
for other managers.

**_Share-option program for employees in foreign subsidiaries_**

In November 2004, employees in 100% owned foreign subsidiaries were granted options that give the
right to purchase 90 shares in TDC A/S at an exercise price of DKK 78 per share. For tax purposes, employees in
the USA were offered options entitling them to purchase 113 shares in TDC A/S at an exercise price of DKK 108
per share. Each share option entitles the holder to purchase one share.

The share options may be exercised during a four-week period following the publication of the third
Quarterly Report in 2009, or in the first window after October 1, 2009, provided the employee has been
continuously employed in one of the 100% owned subsidiaries or in a company controlled by TDC A/S. The
options may, however, be exercised in the event of change of control of the company. 3,095 employees were
granted 278,711 options with a total fair value of DKK 27m. The calculations of fair values have been based on
the Black-Scholes option pricing model.

1 Calculations of fair values at issuance and at year-end have been based on the Black-Scholes option-pricing
model. The following assumptions have been used for the calculation at year-end 2005: a dividend per share of
DKK 12.50, a volatility of 21%, a risk-free interest rate of 2.8%-3.0% and expected remaining option lives of
0-5 years


-----

**Note 6** **Wages, salaries and pension costs (continued)**

The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility (calculated as the weighted average remaining
lives of granted share options) adjusted for the expected change hereof due to publicly available information.
Expenses in relation to the share-option program for employees in foreign subsidiaries amounted to DKK 5m in
2005 compared with DKK 0m in 2004. Expenses in relation to the Danish share-option program amounted to
DKK 24m in 2005 compared with DKK 43m in 2004.

The Group’s capitalized tax loss carry-forwards are expected to be utilized before the end of 2009.

Furthermore, the Group has tax losses to carry forward against future taxable income that have not been
recognized in these Financial Statements due to uncertainty of their recoverability. At December 31, 2005, these
tax losses amount to a tax value of DKK 466m, compared with DKK 499m at December 31, 2004.

All of the Danish Group companies participate in joint taxation. Joint taxation with foreign Group
companies is no longer expected to take place due to the changed Danish tax legislation effective January 1,
2005. For Group companies, which previously participated in the joint taxation, re-taxation of formerly deducted
losses will be effected concurrently with profits in the respective companies and in connection with potential
divestment of the companies. Provisions for re-taxation liabilities related to formerly deducted losses have been
made.

The income tax effect from the Danish joint taxation for the years 2001-2003 is based on an estimated tax
value of goodwill related to Talkline. Income taxes relating to special items for 2004 have been positively
impacted by DKK 218m from an adjustment to the value of goodwill following a decision from the National
Assessment Council in October 2004. TDC has appealed the decision. The outcome could result in additional
income.

TDC A/S has committed to contributing, if necessary, additional capital to TDC Switzerland in order to
generate taxable income sufficient to utilize the accumulated tax loss carry-forwards prior to their expiration.

DKK 929m in 2005, compared with DKK 943m in 2004. Amortization was initiated in 2005. The remaining
amortization period totals 16 years.

**_Goodwill impairment tests_**

The carrying value of goodwill is tested for impairment annually at July 1, and if events or changes in
circumstances indicate impairment.

The impairment test is an integrated part of the Group’s budget and planning process, which, as the
acquisition of enterprises, is based on ten-year business plans. The discount rates applied reflect specific risks
relating to the individual cash-generating unit. The recoverable value is based on the value in use determined on
expected cash flows based on ten-year business plans approved by Management.

Goodwill of DKK 28,533m at December 31, 2005 relates primarily to TDC’s investments in TDC
Switzerland and TDC Song. The assumptions for calculating the value in use for the most significant goodwill
amounts are given below. Any reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions are deemed not to cause the
carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable value.

_TDC Switzerland_

The carrying value of goodwill relating to TDC Switzerland amounted to DK 24,068m at December 31,
2005. The recoverable value is sensitive primarily to changes in the expected revenue growth. The projected
revenue growth will stem mainly from an increased market share, partly offset by falling prices. The growth rate
applied to extrapolate projected future cash flows for the period following 2014 is 4.0%. The growth rate is not
deemed to exceed the long-term average growth rate in TDC Switzerland’s markets. A discount rate of 6.6% has
been applied.

_TDC Song_

The carrying value of goodwill relating to TDC Song amounted to DK 2,057m at December 31, 2005.
The recoverable value is sensitive primarily to changes in the projected revenue growth. The projected revenue
growth will stem primarily from customer base growth and increased revenue per customer. The growth rate
applied to extrapolate projected future cash flows for the period following 2014 is 2.0%. The growth rate is not
deemed to exceed the long-term average growth rate in TDC Song’s markets. A discount rate of 9.6% has been
applied.

changed accounting policies related to goodwill in connection with the implementation of IFRS.

Net investments in foreign Group subsidiaries and associates are hedged for foreign currency risks only
for TDC Switzerland. Net investments in foreign enterprises include goodwill.

_B: Interest-rate exposure_

Interest-rate swap agreements have been used to restructure interest-bearing assets and liabilities in order
to achieve the intended interest-rate profile of fixed [1] and floating interest rates.

The maturity profile of interest-bearing assets and liabilities is allocated according to maturity period.
Effective interest rates at December 31, 2005 include derivatives.

The TDC Group holds a European Commercial Paper program of nominal EUR 1.5bn (translated into
DKK 11,191m). Amounts drawn from the program must be secured 1:1 by committed credit lines and in this way
do not increase the above-mentioned credit lines.

_D: Credit risks_

Financial instruments are entered only with counterparties holding the credit rating of A-/A-3 or higher
from Standard & Poor’s or Moody’s Investor Service. Each counterparty credit line is determined by the
counterparty’s credit rating and is of a size that spreads the credit risks of the TDC Group’s total credit lines over
several counter-parties. The counterparty risk is therefore considered to be minimal.

**Note 29** **Pension assets and pension obligations**

_A: Domestic defined benefit plans_

At December 31, 2005, approximately 3,850 of the TDC Group’s employees were entitled to a pension
from the three pension funds related to TDC under conditions similar to those provided by the Danish Civil
Servants’ Pension Plan. In addition, 7,750 members of the pension funds receive or are entitled to receive
pension benefits. Since 1990, no new members have joined the pension fund plans, and the pension funds are
prevented from admitting new members in the future due to the bylaws.

The pension funds operate defined benefit plans and, in accordance with existing legislation, bylaws and
the pension regulations, TDC is required to make contributions to meet the premium reserve requirements.
Future pension benefits are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants’ compensation at the
time of retirement.

The basis for determining the overall expected rate of return is the pension funds’ long-term strategic
asset allocation of approximately 35% as equity securities, 50% as debt securities and 15% as real estate. The
overall expected rate of return is based on the average long-term yields on the plan assets invested or to be
invested.

The expected return on plan assets for 2006 amounts to 5.80%.

In 2005, the assumed rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate have been reduced to
reflect changes in market conditions and in the mix of assets held by our pension funds. The assumptions for
2006 reflect a further reduction of the discount rate and unchanged assumptions with respect to general wage
inflation and expected return on plan assets. The demographic assumptions used for 2005 reflect an expected
longer life than previously assumed. The changed assumptions have resulted in increased pension benefit
obligations compared with 2004. With these changed assumptions, TDC’s total pension costs excluding
redundancy programs are expected to increase approximately DKK 10m in 2006 compared with 2005, assuming
all other factors remain unchanged.

The average remaining service periods of active plan participants expected to receive benefits were
estimated to be 13.2 years at December 31, 2005, compared with 13.5 years at December 31, 2004.

**_Cash flows_**

TDC’s current contributions were DKK 143m in 2005, against DKK 65m in 2004. Furthermore,
extraordinary contributions were DKK 54m following a reduced work force in 2005, compared with DKK 470m
in 2004. For 2006 the projected current contributions amounted to DKK 131m. As in 2005, extraordinary
contributions are expected to be paid in connection with retirements.

**_Other information_**

Approximately 600 members of the defined benefit plans will ultimately have part of their pension
payment reimbursed by the Danish government. The related benefit obligations, approximately DKK 530m, have
been deducted, arriving at the projected benefit obligation.

TDC A/S has assumed all pension obligations for the members of the three Danish pension funds.
Accordingly, the net periodic pension cost/income and the plan assets for the three Danish pension funds are
related to TDC A/S. Subsidiaries employing the members pay contributions to TDC A/S, which are included in
the pension costs of the respective subsidiary.

_B: Foreign defined benefit plans_

Pension costs for members of foreign Group enterprises operating defined benefit plans are determined on
the basis of the development in the actuarially determined pension obligations and on the yield on the pension
funds’ assets. The difference between the actuarially determined pension obligations and the fair value of the
pension funds’ assets is recognized in the Balance Sheets under pension provisions, etc.

TDC’s foreign defined benefit plans concern primarily TDC Switzerland.


-----

**Note 29** **Pension assets and pension obligations (continued)**

_C: Pensions for former Danish civil servants_

In addition to the defined benefit plans, the Group has paid annual pension contributions to the Danish
government. The pension contributions were paid for employees who have retained their rights as civil servants
to defined pension benefits from the Danish government due to previous employment agreements.

In 1994, the Group reached an agreement with the Danish government to make a one-time payment of
DKK 1,210m, of which DKK 108m was considered interest compensation for the period July 1, 1994, to
August 1, 1995. This agreement was in respect of the Group’s pension obligation to employees who participated
in the Danish civil servants’ pension plan. Under the agreement, the Group’s pension contributions to the Danish
Government ceased at July 1, 1994. The agreed non-recurring payment is treated as a pre-paid expense, which
will be amortized and expensed over the average expected remaining service lives of the active employees
concerned.

In connection with the reduction in the number of employees in 2005 and previous years, some retired
employees have retained their rights to civil servant pensions from the Danish government. It is deemed that the
retirements will not cause further payments on the part of the Company.

Total future minimum sublease payments expected for interminable subleases on balance sheet dates
amounted to DKK 35m at December 31, 2005, compared with DKK 51m at December 31, 2004.

Operating leases, for which TDC is the lessee, are related primarily to agreements on fiber networks, sea
cable and agreements on property leases, including agreements with the related Danish pension funds. The lease
agreements terminate in 2020 at the latest.

**Note 30** **Other financial commitments and lease receivables (continued)**

Total contingent lease amounts recognized as income amounted to DKK 101m in 2005, compared with
DKK 16m in 2004.

Operating leases, for which the TDC Group is the lessor, are related primarily to agreements on
telecommunications installations.

**Note 31** **Contingent assets and contingent liabilities**

**_Contingent assets_**

The TDC Group is awaiting the outcome of certain cases brought against other telecommunications
companies. A potential favorable outcome for TDC of one or more of these cases could result in substantial
income.

**_Contingent liabilities_**

The TDC Group is party to certain pending lawsuits and cases pending with public authorities and
complaints boards. Based on a legal assessment of the possible outcome of each of these lawsuits and cases,
Management is of the opinion that these will have no significant adverse effect on the TDC Group’s financial
position.

In connection with capital sale and leaseback agreements, the Group has provided guarantees covering
intermediary leasing companies’ payment of the total lease commitments. The Group has made legally releasing
non-recurring payments to the intermediary leasing companies of an amount corresponding to the total lease
commitments. At December 31, 2005, the guarantees amounted to DKK 3,291m, compared with DKK 3,030m at
December 31, 2004. The guarantees provided by the TDC Group are economically defeased by means of
payment instruments issued by creditworthy obligors unrelated to the TDC Group that secure or otherwise
provide for payment of the regular lease payments and purchase-option prices due from the intermediary leasing
companies. These instruments are lodged as security for payment of the regular lease payments by the
intermediary leasing companies.

In accordance with Section 32 of the Danish Civil Servants Act, the Group has a termination benefit
obligation to former Danish civil servants and to employees with civil-servant status hired before April 1, 1970
who are members of the related Danish pension funds.

The Group has provided the usual guarantees in favor of suppliers and partners. These guarantees
amounted to DKK 90m at December 31, 2005, compared with DKK 135m at December 31, 2004.

Danish Group companies have entered into certain lease contracts with the related Danish pension funds.
The lease contracts are interminable until 2020 at the latest. The aggregate amount payable under such
agreements amounted to DKK 957m at December 31, 2005, compared with DKK 1,242m at December 31, 2004.
The rental expense was DKK 122m for 2005, compared with DKK 139m in 2004. Compensation for terminating
a lease amounted to DKK 20m in 2005. In addition, annual contributions are paid to the pension funds, see note
29 Pension obligations.

Remuneration for the Board of Directors and the Executive Committee is described in note 6.

**Note 34** **Reconciliation to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP)**

The Consolidated Financial Statements of TDC have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. Furthermore, the Consolidated
Financial Statements of TDC have been prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS) issued by IASB.

IFRS differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
(US GAAP). A description of the significant differences between IFRS and US GAAP as they relate to TDC are
discussed in further detail below.

_a) Pensions_

Under IFRS, pension assets, pension liabilities and expenses related to defined benefit plans are
determined in a similar manner to US GAAP. However, under IFRS, prior service cost, transition obligations and
expenses resulting from plan amendments are generally recognized immediately. Under US GAAP, these
expenses are generally recognized over a longer period.

In accordance with IFRS 1, unrecognized actuarial gains and losses as of January 1, 2004 are recognized
in equity.


-----

**Note 34** **Reconciliation to United States Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (US GAAP) (continued)**

As opposed to IFRS, a liability at least equal to the unfunded part of the accumulated benefit obligation
(ABO) must be recognized in the balance sheet under US GAAP, when the ABO exceeds the fair value of plan
assets. To the extent that the unfunded ABO exceeds the liabilities already recognized, an additional minimum
liability (AML), net of tax, must be recognized as a reduction of equity. If the unfunded ABO is lower than the
liabilities already recognized, no further liabilities are recognized.

_b) Formation of the Group_

In accordance with IFRS, certain items of property, plant and equipment acquired upon the formation of
the Group were restated at fair value, whereas goodwill and rights were capitalized. The capitalized excess values
are amortized over the useful lives of the assets. Under US GAAP, the transfer of assets between parties under
joint control was accounted for using the pooling-of-interests method. Accordingly, restatement of property,
plant and equipment to fair value and any capitalization of goodwill and rights related to the formation of the
Group were eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.

_c) Reversal of capitalization of site costs_

In accordance with IFRS, site pre-acquisition costs are expensed only in cases where no permission is
obtained for a certain site. Under US GAAP, all site pre-acquisition costs are expensed as incurred until
Management receives the appropriate permission from official authorities to begin construction of the site.

_d) Development costs_

In accordance with IFRS, development costs are recognized as intangible assets if the cost can be
calculated reliably and is expected to generate future economic benefits. Development costs are amortized over a
period of three to five years. Under US GAAP, development costs are expensed as incurred, except for computer
software developed for internal use.

_e) Depreciation in year of acquisition or construction_

According to TDC Group accounting policies until year-end 1992, a full year’s depreciation was charged
on fixed assets in the year of acquisition or construction of the asset. Under US GAAP, such depreciation
commences from the time of acquisition or from the date of the asset’s entry into service.

_f) Revenue recognition_

In accordance with IFRS, elements in revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are recognized as
separate units of accounting, independent of any contingent element related to the delivery of additional items or
other performance conditions. Under US GAAP, multiple element contracts as from June 15, 2003 are recorded
in accordance with EITF No. 00-21 “Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables” under
which the amount allocable to a delivered item is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of
additional items or meeting other performance conditions.

_g) Asset retirement obligations_

In accordance with IFRS, the effect of a change in the fair value of an asset retirement obligation is
capitalized and depreciated over the remaining useful life of the underlying asset. Under US GAAP, such asset
retirement obligations are accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards
no. 143, “Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations” (SFAS 143). Accordingly, the accumulated accretion
and depreciation expense to December 31, 2002 is recognized in the financial statements as a cumulative
catch-up adjustment.

Furthermore, IFRS (IFRIC Interpretation No. 1 “Changes in Existing Decommissioning, Restoration and
Similar Liabilities”) does not treat changes in the estimate of undiscounted cash flows and discount rates in the
same way as SFAS 143.

_h) Jubilee obligations_

In accordance with IFRS and US GAAP, jubilee benefits provided for employees are recognized in the
year in which the associated services are rendered by the employees. The liability with respect to jubilee benefits
was calculated for the first time in 2004 in connection with the implementation of IFRS, thereby bringing IFRS
and US GAAP in compliance

_i) Gain related to sale of shares_

In accordance with IFRS, a gain arising from sale of shares is recognized when the inflow of economic
benefits can be measured reliably. Under US GAAP, a gain should not be recognized until the final price is
established.

_j) Gain on divestment of enterprises_

Gain on divestment of enterprises includes the accumulated effect of differences between IFRS and
US GAAP relating to divested enterprises at the time of divestment.

_k) Other_

Other consists of some minor differences between IFRS and US GAAP that are immaterial on both an
individual and aggregate basis, and therefore are not separately disclosed.

_l) Deferred tax_

This reconciliation item includes all tax effects due to the above-mentioned reconciling.

_m) Capital sale and leaseback agreements_

In accordance with IFRS, non-recurring payments that have been made to legally release future lease
payments are offset against the lease commitments in the balance sheets. Under US GAAP, in certain
circumstances the non-recurring payments and the corresponding lease commitments must be shown as assets
and as liabilities in the balance sheet.

_n) Minority interests on acquisition_

In accordance with IFRS, in connection with the acquisition of a less than 100% owned subsidiary, any
minority interests should be stated at the minorities’ proportion of the net fair value of acquired assets, liabilities
and contingent liabilities assumed. In accordance with US GAAP, fair values are assigned only to the parent
company’s shares of the net assets acquired, and the minority interests are valued at historical carrying value.
This difference between IFRS and US GAAP has been adjusted in the footnote below showing balance sheet
items from the Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted in accordance with US GAAP. The difference in
accounting approach has no impact on the reconciliation of net income and equity attributable to Company
shareholders.

_o) Share-based payment_

In accordance with IFRS, the value of services received from employees in exchange for incentives is
recognized in the Statements of Income over the vesting period and is measured at the fair value at the grant date
of the share options. Under US GAAP, in 2005, TDC has applied the modified retrospective application method
in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards no. 123 (revised 2004) “Share-Based Payments” (SFAS 123),
thereby bringing IFRS and US GAAP in compliance. Accordingly, compensation costs and the related tax effect
are recognized in the financial statements as though they had been accounted for under SFAS 123(R). The impact
on net income under US GAAP in 2004 amounts to DKK 52m.

amounted to DKK 2,325m and DKK 117m, respectively.

Goodwill related to acquisitions was calculated at DKK 548m on recognition of identifiable assets,
liabilities and contingent liabilities at fair value. Goodwill represents the value of current employees and
know-how as well as expected synergies arising from the combination with the TDC Group.

Since the acquisition in 2004, the acquired subsidiaries contributed revenue of DKK 1,030m and net
income of DKK (50)m.

If the acquisition had been completed on January 1, 2004, revenue for the year would have been
DKK 3,098m and net income for the year would have been DKK 33m.

After recognition of net identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities at fair value, goodwill
arising on the acquisition amounted to DKK 2,696m. Goodwill represents the value of the current employees,
know-how and the anticipated future operating synergies from the combination

**Note 43** **Post balance sheet events**

**TDC reduces its work force in domestic operations according to plan**

On January 20, 2006, TDC decided to implement a redundancy program covering up to 570 employees in
the period until year-end 2006, which should be seen in relation to the necessity of an approx. 5% work-force
reduction in 2006 previously announced. The redundancy program will be initiated through voluntary retirement
to limit the extent of involuntary retirement. Total costs related to work-force reductions are estimated at DKK
342m after tax. The amount will be expensed as a special item in the first quarter of 2006.

**Tender offer and debt redemption**

On December 2, 2005, Nordic Telephone Company Aps (“NTC”) launched the tender offer for all
ordinary shares issued by TDC (“TDC Shares”) and all American Depositary Shares (“TDC ADSs”). The tender
offer expired on January 20, 2006, with NTC acquiring approximately 88.2% of the TDC Share Capital pursuant
to the tender offer, which settled on February 1, 2006.

On December 21, 2005, in conjunction with the Tender Offer, Nordic Telephone Company Holding ApS
(“NTC Holding”) invited the holders of certain series of TDC’s Euro Medium Term Notes (the “EMTNs”),
excluding a series of notes due on April 24, 2006, to offer or sell them to NTC Holding or another entity
designated by NTC Holding, and to consent to certain amendments relating to these notes (together, the
“Invitations”).

**TDC offers its ownership share in Polkomtel to the other shareholders**

On February 2, 2006, due to this change of ownership described above and in accordance with the
existing shareholder agreement with Polkomtel as well as the company’s bylaws, TDC has offered to sell its
19.6% ownership share to the other shareholders of Polkomtel at a price of EUR 214.04 per share, reflecting a
market value of EUR 4.388bn for 100% of the company’s common shares. The result and the time frame of the
selling process depend on the shareholders’ response to TDC’s offer.
