**SUBJECT TO COMPLETION DATED JANUARY 9, 2017**


**PRELIMINARY OFFERING MEMORANDUM** **NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION**
**CONFIDENTIAL** **IN THE UNITED STATES**

**TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC**


**£300,000,000** **% Senior Notes due 2022**

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC (the “Issuer”), a public limited company incorporated under the laws of
England and Wales, is offering (the “Offering”) £300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its % Senior
Notes due 2022 (the “Notes”). The Issuer will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on each
and, commencing on, 2017. The Notes will mature on, 2022.

The Issuer may redeem some or all of the Notes by paying 100% of the principal amount of such Notes plus a
“make-whole” premium. In addition, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes may be redeemed
with the net proceeds of certain equity offerings at the redemption price set forth in this offering memorandum.

Upon the occurrence of certain change of control events, each holder of the Notes may require the Issuer to
repurchase all or a portion of its respective Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional amounts, if any. In the event of certain developments
affecting taxation, the Issuer may redeem all, but not less than all, of the Notes, as applicable.

The Notes will be the Issuer’s senior obligations and will rank pari passu in right of payment with all other
existing and future senior debt of the Issuer that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The
Notes will be senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the Issuer that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes will be guaranteed (the “Guarantees”) on a senior
unsecured basis by TalkTalk Telecom Holdings Limited, TalkTalk Communications Limited and TalkTalk Telecom
Limited (collectively, the “Guarantors”). The Guarantees will rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the
existing and future indebtedness of the Guarantors that is not expressly subordinated in right of payment to the
Guarantees. The Guarantees will rank senior in right of payment to all existing and future indebtedness of the
Guarantors that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Guarantees. The Notes and the Guarantees will
be effectively subordinated to all of the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ future secured debt to the extent of the value of
the assets securing such debt. The Notes and the Guarantees will be structurally subordinated to all existing and
future obligations and other liabilities of the Issuer’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes.

There is currently no public market for the Notes. Application will be made to The Channel Islands Securities
Exchange Authority Limited (the “Exchange”) for the listing of and permission to deal in the Notes on the Official
List of the Exchange. There can be no assurance that the Notes will be listed on the Official List of the Exchange,
that such permission to deal in the Notes will be granted or that such listing will be maintained.


#### Investing in the Notes involves a high degree of risk. See “Risk Factors” beginning on page 19.


#### Issue Price of the Notes: 100.0% plus accrued interest, if any, from the Issue Date.

The Notes have not been, and will not be, registered under the U.S. Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
“U.S. Securities Act”), or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. The Notes are being offered and sold in
offshore transactions outside the United States in compliance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act
(“Regulation S”). The Notes may not be offered, sold or delivered within the United States (as defined in
Regulation S), except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act. See “Important Information” for further details about eligible offerees
and “Notice to Investors” for transfer and resale restrictions.

The Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples
of £1,000 in excess thereof. On the Issue Date, global notes representing the Notes will be deposited and
registered in the name of a nominee of a common depositary for Euroclear Bank SA/NV (“Euroclear”) and
Clearstream banking, société anonyme (“Clearstream”). We expect the Notes to be delivered to the Initial
Purchasers (as defined below) on or about, 2017. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**IMPORTANT INFORMATION**

This offering memorandum is confidential and has been prepared by us solely for use in connection with the
proposed Offering of the Notes described in this offering memorandum. This offering memorandum is personal
to each offeree and does not constitute an offer to any other person or to the public generally to subscribe for or
otherwise acquire the Notes. Distribution of this offering memorandum to any person other than the prospective
investors and any person retained to advise such prospective investors with respect to the purchase of the Notes is
unauthorized, and any disclosure of any of the contents of this offering memorandum, without our prior written
consent, is prohibited. Each prospective investor, by accepting delivery of this offering memorandum, agrees to
the foregoing and to make no copies of this offering memorandum or any documents referred to in this offering
memorandum.

The distribution of this offering memorandum and the offering and sale of the Notes in certain jurisdictions
may be restricted by law. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum or any of the Notes come
must inform themselves about, and observe any restrictions on, the transfer and exchange of the Notes. See
“Notice to Investors” and “Plan of Distribution.”

In making an investment decision regarding the Notes, prospective investors must rely on their own
examination of our business and the terms of the Offering, including the merits and risks involved, and any
decision to invest in the Notes should be based solely on this offering memorandum. In addition, neither we nor
any of the Initial Purchasers nor any of their representatives are making any representation to you regarding the
legality of an investment in the Notes, and you should not construe anything in this offering memorandum as
legal, business or tax advice. You should consult your own advisors as to legal, tax, business, financial and
related aspects of an investment in the Notes. You must comply with all laws applicable in any jurisdiction in
which you buy, offer or sell the Notes or possess or distribute this offering memorandum, and you must obtain all
applicable consents and approvals; neither we nor the Initial Purchasers shall have any responsibility for any of
the foregoing legal requirements.

The Initial Purchasers are not making any representation or warranty, express or implied, that the
information contained in this offering memorandum is accurate or complete and are not responsible for this
information. Nothing contained in this offering memorandum is, or shall be relied upon as, a promise or
representation by any of the Initial Purchasers as to the past or the future.

We accept responsibility for the information contained in this offering memorandum. To the best of the
knowledge of the Issuer and the Guarantors, having taken all reasonable care to ensure such is the case, the
information contained in this offering memorandum is in accordance with the facts and contains no omission
likely to affect its import. However, the information set out in the sections entitled “Summary,” “Management’s
_Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” “Industry Overview” and “Business”_
includes extracts from information and data, including industry and market data, released by publicly available
sources in Europe and elsewhere. While we accept responsibility for the accurate extraction and summarization
of such industry and market information and data, we have not independently verified the accuracy of such
information and data and we accept no further responsibility in respect thereof. In addition, this offering
memorandum contains summaries believed to be accurate with respect to certain documents, but reference is
made to the actual documents for complete information. All such summaries are qualified in their entirety by
such reference. However, as far as we are aware, no information or data has been omitted which would render
reproduced information inaccurate or misleading.

The information contained in this offering memorandum is correct as of the date hereof. Neither the delivery
of this offering memorandum at any time after the date of publication nor any subsequent commitment to
purchase the Notes shall, under any circumstances, create an implication that there has been no change in the
information set forth in this offering memorandum or in our business since the date of this offering
memorandum.

We have accurately reproduced the information set out in relation to sections of this offering memorandum
describing clearing arrangements, including in the section entitled “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form,” and as far
as we are aware and able to ascertain from third-party sources, no facts have been omitted which would render
the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. Nonetheless, such information is subject to any change in,
or reinterpretation of, the rules, regulations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream currently in effect.
While we accept responsibility for accurately summarizing the information concerning Euroclear and
Clearstream, we accept no further responsibility in respect of such information. Neither Euroclear nor
Clearstream are under any obligation to perform or continue to perform under such clearing arrangements and
such arrangements may be modified or discontinued by either of them at any time. We will not, nor will any of

their respective participants. Investors wishing to use these clearing systems are advised to confirm the continued
applicability of these arrangements.

By receiving this offering memorandum, you acknowledge that you have had an opportunity to request from
us for review, and that you have received, all additional information you deem necessary to verify the accuracy
and completeness of the information contained in this offering memorandum. You also acknowledge that you
have not relied on the Initial Purchasers in connection with your investigation of the accuracy of this information
or your decision whether to invest in the Notes.

The contents of our websites do not form any part of this offering memorandum. Our websites are mainly
addressed to potential clients of our services and, therefore, information available on our websites may differ in
content or may be organized differently than information in this offering memorandum. For the purposes of
making an investment decision regarding the Notes, you should not rely on our websites.

None of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), any state securities commission or any
other U.S. regulatory authority, has approved or disapproved the Notes nor have any of the foregoing authorities
passed upon or endorsed the merits of this Offering or the accuracy or adequacy of this offering memorandum.
Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense. The Notes are subject to restrictions on transferability
and resale and may not be transferred or resold, except in offshore transactions in compliance with Regulation S
under the U.S. Securities Act. As a prospective investor, you should be aware that you may be required to bear
the financial risks of this investment for an indefinite period of time. Please refer to the sections in this offering
memorandum entitled “Plan of Distribution” and “Notice to Investors.”

The Notes will be available initially only in book-entry form. We expect that the Notes sold pursuant to this
offering memorandum will be issued in the form of a global note, which will be deposited with, or on behalf of a
common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream and registered in the name of the nominee of the common
depositary for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream. Beneficial interests in the global note will be shown
on, and transfers of beneficial interests in the global note will be effected only through, records maintained by
Euroclear and Clearstream and their direct and indirect participants, as applicable. After the initial issuance of the
global note, Notes in certificated form will be issued in exchange for the global note only as set forth in the
indenture governing the Notes (the “Indenture”). See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

We reserve the right to withdraw the Offering at any time. We and the Initial Purchasers reserve the right to
reject any offer to purchase the Notes, in whole or in part for any reason or no reason and to allot to any
prospective purchaser less than the full amount of the Notes sought by it. The Initial Purchasers and certain of
their respective related entities may acquire a portion of the Notes for their own accounts.

We have prepared this offering memorandum solely for use in connection with the Offering of the Notes in
accordance with Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act. We cannot guarantee that the application we will
make to the Exchange for the Notes to be listed on its Official List and admitted to trading thereon will be
approved as of the settlement date for the Notes or at any time thereafter, and settlement of the Notes is not
conditional on obtaining such admission to trading.

Each purchaser of the Notes will be deemed to have made the representations, warranties and
acknowledgements that are described in the section entitled “Notice to Investors” of this offering memorandum.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE OFFERING OF THE NOTES, BARCLAYS BANK PLC OR ONE OR
MORE OF ITS AFFILIATES OR PERSONS ACTING ON ITS BEHALF (THE “STABILIZING
**MANAGER”) MAY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, OVERALLOT THE NOTES**
OR EFFECT TRANSACTIONS WITH A VIEW TO SUPPORTING THE MARKET PRICE OF THE NOTES
AT A LEVEL HIGHER THAN THAT WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE PREVAIL. HOWEVER, THERE IS NO
ASSURANCE THAT THE STABILIZING MANAGER WILL UNDERTAKE STABILIZATION ACTION.
ANY STABILIZATION ACTION, IF COMMENCED, MAY BEGIN ON OR AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH
ADEQUATE PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THE TERMS OF THE OFFERING OF THE NOTES IS MADE
AND MAY BE ENDED AT ANY TIME, BUT IT MUST END NO LATER THAN 30 DAYS AFTER THE

**PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL AND OTHER DATA**

**Financial Information**

The financial information presented in this offering memorandum is, unless otherwise indicated, our
historical consolidated financial information. The Issuer is the holding company for the Group.

Included herein are the following financial statements:

   - our audited consolidated financial statements as at and for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and
2016 (in each case, prepared in accordance with the IFRS as adopted by the European Union (“EU”)) (the
“Annual Financial Statements”); and

   - our interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended September 30, 2016,
with comparative figures for the six months ended September 30, 2015 (prepared in accordance with
IAS 34 Interim Financial Reporting) (the “Interim Financial Statements” and, together with the Annual
Financial Statements, the “Financial Statements”).

Our financial statements are presented in British pounds sterling. Accordingly, the Financial Statements
included herein are presented in British pounds sterling.

In this offering memorandum we present income statement items on a headline basis. Headline income
statement line items are calculated by adding non-operating amortisation and exceptional items to statutory
income statement line items.

Certain financial information in this offering memorandum has been presented for the twelve months ended
September 30, 2016. Such financial information has been computed by adding the number for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 to the number for the year ended March 31, 2016 and subtracting from the resulting
total the number for the six months ended September 30, 2015, in each case, in the relevant line item. The
financial information for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016 is unaudited.

**Non-IFRS Financial Measures**

In this offering memorandum, we present certain financial measures that are not defined in and, thus, not
calculated in accordance with IFRS, U.S. GAAP or generally accepted accounting principles in any other
relevant jurisdiction. These include statutory EBITDA, headline EBITDA and headline EBITDA margin (each as
defined below). Because these measures are not standardised, companies can define and calculate these measures
differently, and therefore we urge you not to use them as a basis for comparing our results with those of other
companies.

We calculate our “statutory EBITDA” by adding back to our statutory operating profit or loss charges for
statutory depreciation, statutory amortisation and statutory share of results of joint ventures.

Headline EBITDA is statutory EBITDA before adjustments for the effect of exceptional items. Headline
EBITDA margin is the ratio of our headline EBITDA for a period to our headline revenue for the same period.

Statutory EBITDA, headline EBITDA and headline EBITDA margin under our definitions may not be
comparable to similar measures presented by other companies and labelled “Statutory EBITDA”, “Headline
EBITDA” or “Headline EBITDA margin,” respectively. We believe that statutory EBITDA, headline EBITDA
and headline EBITDA margin are useful analytical tools for presenting a normalised measure of income and cash
flows that disregards temporary fluctuations in working capital. EBITDA and EBITDA margin and are widely
used by certain investors, securities analysts and other interested parties as supplemental measures of
performance and liquidity.

Since operating profit and actual cash flows for a given period can differ significantly from these normalised
measures, we urge you to consider these figures for any period together with our data for cash flows from
operations and other cash flow data and our operating profit under IFRS as adopted by the EU. You should not
consider statutory EBITDA, headline EBITDA or headline EBITDA margin as substitutes for operating profit or
cash flows from our operating activities. Non-IFRS measures that we present in this offering memorandum may
also be defined differently from the corresponding terms in the Indenture.

**Market Data**

Information regarding macroeconomic trends, market position, growth rates and other industry data
pertaining to our business contained in this offering memorandum consists, with certain exceptions, of estimates

ix


-----

based on data compiled by professional organisations and analysts, of data from other external sources and of our
knowledge of our market. These data are subject to change and cannot be verified with complete certainty due to
limits on the availability and reliability of the raw data and other limitations and uncertainties inherent in any
statistical survey. In particular, in this offering memorandum in the section entitled “Industry Overview” we have
cited certain reports and surveys by Ofcom, Cisco, YouGov Research, Ovum, GfK SE and the Broadcasters’
Audience Research Board. The analysts compiling these reports base their estimates and conclusions on a variety
of different sources, some of which may be more accurate or reliable than others. Thus, our market share
estimates, calculated using our internal customer records, and data of our competitors published by third parties,
may differ from third-party analyst estimates of our market share. We cannot provide any assurance that
customer numbers of our competitors in such analyst reports and databases are correct or the same as those
contained in our competitors’ internal records. Therefore, you should use caution in analysing these estimates
and should not place undue reliance on them.

Where information has been sourced from a third party, such information has been accurately reproduced
and as far as we are aware and are able to ascertain from information published by such third party, no facts have
been omitted which would render the reproduced information inaccurate or misleading. However, you should
keep in mind that we have not independently verified information we have obtained from any third-party sources.

**Rounding**

Certain amounts that appear in this offering memorandum have been subject to rounding adjustments.
Accordingly, figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures that
precede them.

**Currencies**

In this offering memorandum, references to “GBP”, “£”, “sterling”, “British pound sterling” or “pounds
sterling” are to the currency of the United Kingdom (“UK”), references to “euro,” “EUR,” “€” or “eurocents” are
to the currency of the member states of the EU participating in the European Monetary Union and references to
“U.S. dollar”, “USD” or “$” are to the currency of the United States.

No representation is made that any specific currency amount in this offering memorandum could have been
converted into any of the other currencies presented in this offering memorandum at any particular rate or at all.

**EXCHANGE RATE INFORMATION**

The following table sets out the period end, high, average and low exchange rates, for the periods and dates
indicated, expressed as U.S. dollars per £1.00, in each case as published by Bloomberg Composite Rate
(London).

The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a “best market” calculation, in which, at any point in time, the bid rate is
equal to the highest bid rate of all contributing bank indications and the ask rate is set to the lowest ask rate
offered by these banks. The Bloomberg Composite Rate is a mid-value rate between the applied highest bid rate
and the lowest ask rate. The rates may differ from the actual rates used in the preparation of our Financial
Statements and other financial information appearing in this offering memorandum.

As of January 5, 2017, the Bloomberg Composite Rate of pounds sterling was $1.2418 per £1.00.

**OVERVIEW**

We are the UK’s leading value-for-money provider of fixed-line phone and broadband services to
residential and businesses customers. Our fixed-line services are offered through an extensive and
technologically advanced network, covering approximately 96% of UK’s homes. In addition to our fixed-line
connectivity offerings, we provide pay TV services through our part ownership of the YouView platform and
mobile services through an MVNO arrangement with Vodafone (which we intend to transition to Telefónica UK
during 2017). We offer our phone and broadband services both on a retail and wholesale basis, and leverage our
existing fixed-line customer base and our extensive fixed network to offer dual play (fixed-line phone and
broadband internet), triple play (dual play plus pay TV or mobile) and quad play (dual play plus pay TV and
mobile) products.

Our consumer business offers quad play products incorporating broadband internet, voice, pay TV and
mobile to Retail customers through a simple tariff structure and low prices. Our unique non-subscription pay TV
offering provides flexible access to free and pay-to-view third-party content through the YouView platform. As
at September 30, 2016, we had approximately 3.0 million Retail phone and broadband customers, approximately
1.3 million of which also subscribed to our pay TV service and approximately 793,000 were mobile customers.

Our fast growing B2B division, TTB, offers a wide range of data connectivity and next generation voice
products to businesses across the UK. We provide fixed-line phone, broadband internet (including high speed
Ethernet), data networking and other connectivity solutions to private companies and public sector organizations,
both directly and on a wholesale basis through approximately 850 partners. As at September 30, 2016, we had
approximately 899,000 Wholesale broadband and phone customers, and approximately 39,000 connected data
lines. We are one of only three national network providers in the UK that offer wholesale connectivity services,
broadband, FTTC and Ethernet to large national ISPs, such as the Post Office and Telecom Plus.

**Strengths**

Our strengths include the following:

   - Structurally attractive fixed-line market in the UK. The UK’s fixed-line market is structurally attractive
for an existing value-for-money provider of a national scale, such as the Group. Firstly, we believe it
would require a sizeable investment, in time and money, to roll-out a nationwide unbundled architecture
comparable with ours. Any such development would be extremely technologically challenging given,
among other things, physical constraints in BTOR’s exchanges where our network equipment is housed,
and BTOR’s capacity to deliver connections in those exchanges. Secondly, at present, the only
technological substitute for fixed-line connectivity is wireless data and voice traffic through a mobile
network. However, data transportation via a mobile network is significantly more expensive, radio
spectrum availability is constrained and finite and there is no evidence that such technological and
economic impediments could easily be overcome in the near future. This is against a backdrop of
exponentially growing data usage, driven by device proliferation and video so that mobile users are
expected to increase their data traffic from 0.96GB/month in 2015 to 5.6GB/month in 2020, while
households are expected to increase their fixed-line traffic from 84.5GB/month in 2015 to
202.1GB/month in 2020 (Source: Cisco). Thirdly, there is a clear history of pro-competition regulation in
our industry over the last decade. Such regulation has been targeted at curtailing the powers of BT as the
incumbent provider and has promoted development of retail competitors on a national scale. We believe
that Ofcom will continue its policy to restrain BT’s ability to abuse its dominant market position, which
will ensure access to its core infrastructure on fair terms. As a result of these characteristics, whilst the
market for our services is promotionally intense, it remains fundamentally rational in terms of price
setting, allowing for inflationary price increases.

-----

- Advanced fixed-line infrastructure. Our fixed-line network currently covers approximately 96% of UK’s
homes with MPF and SMPF broadband. The only comparable fixed-line unbundled network is operated
by Sky, which covers approximately 90% of the UK’s population. At the same time, Virgin Media’s and
Vodafone’s fixed-line unbundled networks only cover approximately 55% and 60% of the country’s
population, respectively. At the heart of our network is the unbundling equipment (digital subscriber line
access multiplexers, multi-service access nodes and Ethernet switches) that we have installed in over
3,000 BT exchanges—the largest such deployment in the UK. This allows us to take control of the copper
line that connects customer premises to the exchange. The exchanges are connected via collector nodes
and 10Gbps collector rings to more than 4,000 miles of our dark fibre core optical network—a
high-speed, high-capacity all-IP national backbone that enables efficient and flexible routing of voice and
data traffic. The size and all IP nature of our network also allows us to scale it very efficiently for
growing usage, while driving down unit costs.

- Leading value-for-money positioning. Our network confers a structural cost advantage that has enabled
us to deliver value-for-money telecommunication services to customers, with our consumer fixed-line
propositions significantly less expensive than those offered by our competitors. Our value proposition
makes us the fourth largest residential fixed-line phone and broadband provider with a 14% market share,
based on customer numbers (Source: Ofcom). Our pay TV offer is focused on the large pool of
value-conscious free to air households in the UK (which we estimate to be approximately 10 million
households nationwide) that have not historically wanted to participate in the premium subscription based
pay TV market. We focus on providing customers with flexible, non-subscription access to a wide range
of third-party owned content and have grown to be the third largest operator in the pay TV market with an
8% share based on customer numbers (Source: Ofcom). In addition, we offer mobile services through an
MVNO arrangement currently with Vodafone that we intend to transition to Telefónica UK during 2017.
This new MVNO arrangement will give us access to 4G and national roaming and allow us to build our
own thick core network.

We have leveraged our existing consumer fixed-line scale and our extensive network to drive growth in
dual play, triple play and quad play products. These products enable our customers to save significantly
more money, as compared to products offered by our competitors, while driving ARPU and reducing
customer churn. As the market moves towards triple and quad play bundles, our competitors are using the
bundles to protect a premium product in the bundle. Conversely, as we are the value provider in all four
products (phone, broadband, pay TV and mobile), the more products our customers take from us, the
more money we are able to save them relative to the competition.

Through TTB we provide a wide range of value-for-money connectivity solutions including basic phone
and broadband, high speed Ethernet, and legacy and next generation voice services. We have seen
particularly strong growth in our high margin data connections (Ethernet) business over the last three
years, with revenue growth compounding at over 30%. Our 2015 acquisition of tIPicall is helping us
forge a strong and fast growing next generation voice service (“IP-VPN”) to compliment this growth in
data products. In addition, through our wholesale partners that operate as ISPs, we provide phone,
broadband and FTTC connectivity to over 900,000 end customers, giving us an approximately 35% share
of UK’s wholesale market, second only to BT.

- Strong track record of operational improvement. We have a strong proven track record of operational
improvement. Since the Demerger in 2010, we have delivered over £150 million of cost savings through
integration and back-office simplification programmes. This began with the integration of the Tiscali
business in 2010, which delivered over £100 million of gross cost savings, through significant back office
cost reductions, culminating in our most wide-ranging operational improvement programme, MTTS.
MTTS was launched in 2013 to deliver material customer service improvements, drive operating cost
savings, reduce subscriber acquisition costs and ultimately, create a simpler business which, in turn, is
intended to enable sustainable revenue growth through a transformed brand reputation. Cost savings from
MTTS totalled over £70 million from its introduction in 2013 to the date of this offering memorandum. In
particular, we made significant progress in the year ended March 31, 2016 on our operational efficiency
initiatives, including a comprehensive rebuilding of our online channels with enhanced security features,
a significant improvement in network performance, improvements to order provisioning through case
management, improvements in customer service through implementation of live chat and voice
biometrics and improved fault diagnosis and resolution, reducing engineering cost and unnecessary

-----

customer contact. Further progress was made on all MTTS work streams in the six months ended
September 30, 2016, achieving £17 million in gross cost savings during that period. Our operational
improvements have resulted in the reduction in calls into our contact centres from approximately
2.5 million in July 2010 to approximately 1.0 million in July 2016 and a reduction of complaints filed
with Ofcom from approximately 1,000 in April 2012 to approximately 300 in July 2016, whilst at the
same time driving down churn on our on-net customer base to 1.4% per month in the three months ended
September 30, 2016.

   - Proven historical performance and strengthening financial outlook. In the periods under review, we
have consistently generated strong revenues. We had £1,795 million and £1,838 million of headline
revenue for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and £1,828 million of headline
revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016. Our headline EBITDA and headline EBITDA
margin increased from £245 million and 13.6%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 to
£260 million and 14.1%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and £300 million and
16.4% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016.

Our capital expenditure cash outflows were £112 million, £166 million and £174 million for the years
ended March 31, 2015 and 2016 and twelve months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. This
represented 6.2%, 9.0% and 9.5% of our headline revenue for the respective periods. Following a period
of heightened expenditure on systems to support MTTS, mobile and Fibre to the Premise (“FTTP”) we
expect the ratio of capital expenditure to revenues to revert to our normal 6% - 7% from the year ending
March 31, 2017. Our leverage ratio was at the level of 2.4x, 2.6x and 2.8x for the years ended March 31,
2015 and 2016 and the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and an interest coverage
ratio was at the level of 11.1x, 11.8x and 12.0x, respectively, for the same periods. We expect to
substantially reduce our leverage ratio for the year ended March 31 2017, and target a medium term ratio
of 2.0x.

   - Highly experienced management team. Our senior management team has the combined expertise of
more than 90 years in the telecommunication industry. The Chairman of our Board of Directors, Sir
Charles Dunstone, founded the Group in 2002. Our Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Dido Harding, Baroness
Harding of Winscombe, joined us in 2010 from Sainsbury, where she was a member of the Operating
Board, having previously worked for Tesco in various senior positions. We believe that the collective
industry knowledge and leadership capabilities of our senior management team will enable us to continue
to successfully execute our strategy.

**Strategy**

Our business model is underpinned by our own next generation network, a sustainable regulatory cost
advantage over access to key parts of BT’s network infrastructure and a low cost operating model, which
collectively allow us to price competitively. The political and regulatory environment in which this framework
evolves is critical to our business model and presents significant opportunities for us. Our strategy is to:

   - Leverage and expand our network. The size and all-IP nature of our fixed-line network allow us to scale
it very efficiently for growing usage, enabling us to support growing customer demand for high speeds
and greater data consumption. We have a defined programme of investment in the network to increase
capacity and efficiency in line with the expected growth in demand for high speeds and data consumption.
In 2016, we completed the first phase of our backhaul upgrade (from 1GB to 10GB circuits) to deliver
significant improvements in network performance for our fibre customers.

We expect that network investments over the next two years will be focused on enhancing the capability
of our Next Generation Edge (“NGE”) and Next Generation Access (“NGA”) networks. Having
completed our NGE programme of upgrading all regional nodes within our fixed-line network in 2016,
we have begun to upweight exchanges on the new NGA architecture, with over 100 expected to be
completed by the end of March 2017. We expect another 3,000 exchanges to be completed over the next
18-24 months. This programme is expected to reduce our costs to serve all our customers and drive
further improvements in customer satisfaction.

Over the course of the next ten years we expect to see bandwidth usage across our network increase
10 times. These technology improvements will enable us to scale the network for this demand and will
allow us to substantially drive down our costs. By the end of our relatively modest network investment
programme we expect the entire data network to be brand new, simplified and functionally using the

latest Tier 1 capability. We will also strive to take advantage of regulatory developments, such as
regulatory dark fibre, to ensure an even more material step down in operating costs, putting us in a
position to deliver the significantly increased bandwidth and capacity that our customers are expected to
require.

- Continue to provide value-for-money products. A structural cost advantage conferred by our existing
network enables us to be a value-for-money provider in all the products we sell. Following the launch of
fixed-line phone and broadband services in 2006, we have leveraged our network and fixed-line customer
base by offering additional value-for-money services to consumers such as Internet Protocol television
(“IPTV”), Fibre to the Cabinet (“FTTC”) and mobile. Customers typically save more money with us the
more products they take. In addition, as we have designed our network for peak consumer usage during
the evening, we are able to leverage this capacity during the daytime for B2B customers, enabling us to
offer a wide range of value-for-money voice and data connectivity products to customers ranging from
small office/home office businesses and small and medium sized enterprises to multi-site national
enterprises. We believe that our value-for-money positioning and growing product offer will continue to
drive customer loyalty and sustainable overall revenue growth through revenue-per-user growth from
existing customers, (which is significantly less expensive than increasing revenue by adding new
customers). It will also ensure that we are well positioned to take advantage of favourable usage and
socio-demographic trends, with a growing number of older and smaller households in the UK, growing
data usage and growing triple and quad play penetration.

- Achieve significant scale. Network capability, cost advantage and the ability to offer multiple value-formoney services has enabled us to build a large and sustainable share (approximately 16%) of the UK
fixed-line broadband market (Source: Ofcom). We have leveraged this position to drive growth in TV
(approximately 37% of phone and broadband base), mobile (approximately 22% of phone and broadband
base) and FTTC (approximately 21% of phone and broadband base) bases. We expect that our quad-play
approach will put us in a position to further capitalize on the growing trend amongst UK consumers to
save money by taking bundled products on top of their fixed-line subscriptions. We expect the majority of
our customers to subscribe for all four products in the future, underpinning our scale growth opportunity.

Our B2B division, which is already a scale business, with revenues of over £500 million in the year ended
March 31, 2016, has material further opportunities to grow in the fragmented B2B market. In particular,
our B2B division currently has a 10%-12% share of the UK’s national and metro Ethernet market, where
current forecasts of 11% CAGR (Source: Ovum) would take our share to around 16% by 2020. In
addition, our share in the IP-VPN market is currently approximately 2% and, while the market is forecast
to grow at a CAGR of 2% (Source: Ovum), we see a significant growth opportunity. We also see steady
growth opportunities in our wholesale phone and broadband business.

- Simplify systems and processes to achieve further operational efficiency. As a relatively young business
that has grown very rapidly since the Demerger, we have a significant opportunity to further simplify our
technology platform and customer processes to deliver a higher quality and more secure customer
experience.

MTTS is our Group-wide ranging transformation programme that is delivering material customer service
improvements, reducing churn, driving operating cost savings, reducing subscriber acquisition costs and
ultimately, creating a simpler, better business and transformed brand reputation. We aim to continue our
work on all components of MTTS to deliver a seamless self-service operating model which will be better
for customers and lower cost to operate. We expect this to result in a further £35 million to £40 million of
savings, through improved customer services, in the year ending March 31, 2017 (of which £17 million
have already been delivered during the six months ended September 30, 2016), and annualised savings
beyond this period are expected to be at a substantially higher level.

- Drive disruptive innovation. We have a strong heritage of launching innovative and disruptive products
that leverage our network scale, engineering expertise and cost advantage to save customers money. We
were the first fixed-line operator in the UK to offer free fixed-line calls between customers, free
broadband, unlimited downloads to broadband customers, network level home internet security, a free TV
product (on the YouView platform), business broadband at under £5 per month and free nuisance and
suspicious call blocking.

Our two key future innovation opportunities are FTTP and inside-out mobile.

O We have made significant progress towards achieving critical success factors (cost per home, customer
experience and penetration) in our FTTP proof of concept in York and are taking measured steps to
further test the economics of a broader roll-out. Our initial build has covered nearly 14,000 homes,
with over 2,500 customers signing up to the service with us and Sky since the beginning of 2016 (over
18% penetration in the six months ended September 30, 2016). Build costs have come at £417 per
home, significantly under our £500 per home target, and customer take-up and satisfaction are also
running ahead of targets. Following the success of this first phase, we plan to begin extending the
network across the rest of York. The roll-out is expected to start in the Spring of 2017 and reach a
further 40,000 homes over a period of 18 months, covering the vast majority of the city’s premises.
Our York project was conceived as a joint venture with Sky and City Fibre Holdings, but we plan to
acquire Sky’s equity in the joint venture in 2017, with Sky becoming a long term wholesale customer.
The full York roll-out is expected to cost us approximately £20 million over 18 months to complete.

Beyond York and depending on us successfully proving the economics of the build, we plan to
investigate the feasibility of a larger parallel build across five to six cities in different parts of the UK,
involving approximately 150,000 homes. Building work on any such extended pilot is unlikely to
begin until the year ending March 31, 2019. If the results of this pilot prove the economics of FTTP
then there will be a long-term potential of reaching five to ten million homes over a ten year minimum
build time. Such network development is expected to be funded with external capital, consistent with
our existing financing policy.

O Separately, we are in the advanced stages of a femtocell testing programme that is expected to lead to
the roll-out of active cells in customers’ homes from 2018/19. These indoor cells will allow mobile
traffic to be offloaded onto our fixed-line network, thereby delivering a much improved indoor mobile
experience and savings on the costs payable under our MVNO arrangements.

Both these innovations will allow us to deliver disruptive value-for-money propositions that leverage the
economics of our fixed-line network.

**THE REFINANCING**

On the Issue Date, the Issuer expects to issue the Notes offered hereby. The Issuer expects to use the
proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on balance sheet, to (a) repay the drawings under the 2016
Revolving Credit Facility in full; (b) partially repay the drawings under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and
the Term Loan Facility; and (c) pay costs, expenses and fees (including the Initial Purchasers’ fees, legal,
accounting and other fees and expenses) in connection with the Refinancing. For a detailed discussion of the use
of proceeds see “Use of Proceeds.” For a description of our current and anticipated indebtedness following the
Refinancing, see “Description of Other Indebtedness” and “Capitalization.”

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

**Interim Dividend for the year ending March 31, 2017**

On December 16, 2016 the Issuer paid an interim dividend for the year ending March 31, 2017 in the
amount of 5.29 p per share, or approximately £50 million.

**New Tariff Plans**

At the beginning of October 2016, we replaced all of our existing consumer connectivity tariffs with a new,
radically simpler range of fixed low price plans. These new plans give customers the freedom to choose and fix
their own package for 18 months by tailoring mix-and-match broadband, mobile, TV and land-line calls to suit
their needs. Customers can choose between two new simple packages, each inclusive of line rental:

   - “Fast Broadband”: for speeds of up to 17Mbps (which also includes (i) our “Essential SIM” feature,
providing 200 minutes, unlimited SMS and 500MB of data and (ii) access to the TalkTalk TV Store); and

   - “Faster Fibre Broadband”: for speeds of up to 38Mbps (which also includes (i) our “Essential SIM”
feature, providing 200 minutes, unlimited SMS and 500MB of data and (ii) access to the TalkTalk TV
Store).


5


-----

Uniquely in the market, we have also made these new plans available to all of our existing customers (on
legacy tariffs, such as Simply Broadband, Essentials TV and Plus TV) who are able to move to these plans by
re-contracting with us for 18 months. Our existing customers have responded extremely well to the new plans. In
particular: (a) ten times as many customers have re-contracted than in an average month, (b) many more have
chosen the Faster Fibre Broadband plan than expected, (c) attachment rates for calling and TV boosts have also
been stronger than we had expected. These outcomes reflect the attractiveness of our simple and clear pricing,
and while the take up on the new plans might be at a lower ARPU, the 18 months re-contracting will help reduce
churn. Customers who chose not to re-contract have received an approximately 9%-10% price increase on their
existing packages.

**Industry**

In December 2016, Sky announced the launch of its mobile proposition (based on its MVNO agreement
with Telefónica UK). This offering is aimed at its existing fixed-line phone, broadband and TV customer base.
The offering’s data pricing is comparable to the wider UK market.

**Regulation**

In November 2016, Ofcom announced that it intended to mandate legal separation of BTOR from BT after
BT failed to offer voluntary proposals that would address competition concerns to Ofcom’s satisfaction. Such
separation will require BTOR to become a distinct company with its own independent board of directors and
ownership and control of its assets and resources. Ofcom has specifically stated that if legal separation cannot be
made to work, then full structural separation remains an option. Currently Ofcom is considering a more detailed
legal separation proposal. It is expected to notify and consult with the European Commission accordingly in early
2017. Such consultations are required to allow Ofcom to implement the proposed solution.

Whether BT is ultimately structurally or legally separated from BTOR, we expect reductions in the
wholesale price of BTOR’s GEA, and thus a reduction in our wholesale costs. If BTOR is fully separated, it
would be economically rational for the separated entity to support such a price reduction in order to drive take up
on their network from all ISPs.

**RISK FACTORS**

_An investment in the Notes involves a high degree of risk and is suitable only for investors who (either alone_
_or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks_
_of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom._
_Investors should consider carefully whether an investment in the Notes is suitable for them in the light of the_
_risks described below and other information in this offering memorandum and their personal circumstances. The_
_occurrence of any of the following events could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results_
_of operations and financial condition and impair our ability to fulfil our obligations in respect of the Notes,_
_potentially causing a loss of all or part of the investment made when purchasing the Notes._

_The risk factors described below are not an exhaustive list or explanation of all relevant risks and should be_
_used as guidance only. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not currently known to us, or that we currently_
_deem immaterial, may individually or cumulatively also have a material adverse effect on our business,_
_prospects, results of operations and financial condition. This offering memorandum contains “forward-looking”_
_statements that are based on assumptions and estimates, and subject to risks and uncertainties. Our actual_
_results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might_
_cause such differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this offering memorandum. See_
_“Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”_

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY**

**_We face significant competition in the markets in which we operate, which could result in decreases in the_**
**_number of current and potential customers, revenues and profitability._**

The UK consumer pay TV, broadband internet, fixed-line telephony and mobile services markets and the
business fixed-line and mobile telecommunication and data markets in which we operate are highly competitive.
In certain markets, or market segments, we compete with established companies that hold positions of market
power and enjoy certain competitive advantages that we do not, such as having greater economies of scale, easier
access to financing, access to certain new technologies, more comprehensive product offerings, greater personnel
resources, greater brand name recognition, larger subscriber bases, and more experience or longer-established
relationships with regulatory authorities, customers and suppliers.

We face significant competition in the consumer broadband internet market from BT, Sky and Virgin
Media, all of which currently enjoy larger market shares than us. Despite more than 10 years of pro-competition
regulation, BT continues to lead the market by capitalizing on its unique customer recognition potential and
infrastructure ownership, with BTOR being, as of the date of this offering memorandum, the sole supplier of the
national backbone optical network. Sky dominates the pay TV market with its exclusive content proposition. All
of our competitors offer bundled solutions, combining fixed-line and mobile offerings. We also expect pricing
competition in the quad play segment (offering packages that comprise broadband, fixed-line telephony, pay TV
and mobile products) to increase, which may make it more difficult to maintain our value credentials. In addition,
continued consolidation within the industry, such as the recent acquisition of EE by BT, may permit more
competitors to offer triple play (broadband, fixed-line telephony and pay TV) or quad play packages.

In the B2B market for fixed-line telecommunication and data services, we face significant competition from
BT, Vodafone and Virgin Media and for business mobile services from Vodafone, Telefónica UK, BT and Three.

In addition to competition in our traditional services and technologies, we also experience significant
pressure from the rapid development of new technologies and alternative services that are offered by our existing
competitors and new entrants. See “—Rapid technological changes may increase competition and render our
_technologies or services obsolete, and we may fail to adapt to or implement new technological developments in a_
_cost efficient manner or at all.” For example, although we entered the market of VoIP services in April 2015 in_
order to grow our position in business fixed-line telecommunication services, we still face continued decline in
volume and revenues in traditional voice services, mainly due to the competition from other companies offering
alternative technologies to our telephony services, such as Skype.

We may be required to reduce the prices we charge for our services or increase the value of our services
without being able to recoup associated costs. We may also need to pursue legal and regulatory actions. We
expect the level and intensity of competition to continue to increase. Our market position will also depend on
whether our marketing initiatives are effective and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive
factors affecting the industry, including new services, pricing strategies by competitors, changes in consumer
preferences and economic, political and social conditions in the markets in which we operate. Any failure to

19


-----

compete effectively or any inability to respond to or effectively anticipate consumer sentiment, including in
terms of pricing of services, acquisition of new customers and retention of existing customers, could have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Network and information systems failures, whether caused by technical failures or security breaches, could_**
**_result in reduced user traffic and revenue, require unanticipated capital expenditures or harm our reputation._**

Certain critical components of our physical technological infrastructure and our information systems are
vulnerable to damage or disruptions from numerous events, including fire, earthquakes, flood, storms or other
natural disasters, power outages, terrorist acts, equipment or system failures, human errors or intentional
wrongdoings, including breaches of our network or information technology security. In particular, as regards the
integrity of our physical infrastructure, theft of metals is especially acute in the UK due to high prices for scrap
metal, and we are not immune to such thefts.

Unanticipated problems at our facilities, or third-party owned local and long distance networks on which we
rely for the provision of interconnection, roaming and other services, could result in reduced user traffic and
revenue due to subscriber dissatisfaction with performance and reliability. Additionally, such network failures,
hardware or software failures, or computer viruses may occur unexpectedly and these disruptions to our services
could prevent us from billing and collecting revenue, require unanticipated capital expenditures, or result in
regulatory penalties. Protection and monitoring measures against disaster recovery, security breaches, and service
disruptions may be insufficient to prevent losses even when continually updated. Our network may be susceptible
to increased network disturbances and technological problems, and such difficulties can increase over time. Such
disruptions may affect our provision of new or existing services and reputation, leading to costly repairs and loss
of customers. Our revenues could be significantly impacted by such disruptions, which in turn could materially
adversely affect our operating cash flows, business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Sensitive customer data is an important part of our daily business and leakage of such data may violate laws_**
**_and regulations. Any such data security breach, as well as any other failure to fully comply with applicable_**
**_data protection legislation, could result in fines, reputational damage, additional costs and customer churn._**

We accumulate, store and use data in our operations that may be protected by data protection laws.
Although we take precautions to protect customer data in accordance with the applicable privacy requirements,
there may be data leakages or security breaches in the future. We work with third-party service providers, such as
certain software companies, that may not fully comply with the relevant contractual terms and all data protection
obligations imposed on them.

The telecommunication sector has become increasingly digitalized, automated and online-based in recent
years, increasing our exposure to risks of unauthorized or unintended data release through hacking and general
information technology system failures. The sharp rise in cyber and data related crime presents a significant
challenge in terms of securing data and systems against attack. We may fail to maintain and protect customer
data in accordance with applicable regulations and requirements due to unanticipated information technology
problems, system failures, computer viruses, intentional/unintentional misuses, hacker attacks or unauthorized
access to our servers or other failures. Any failure to maintain and protect customer data could affect the quality
of our services, compromise the confidentiality of our customer data or cause service interruptions, and may
result in the imposition of fines and other penalties.

For instance, on October 21, 2015, our website was subject to a severe and sustained cyber attack that
involved unauthorized access to approximately 157,000 customers’ personal details, including unique bank
account numbers and sort codes of approximately 15,000 customers (the “2015 Cyber Attack”). As a result of
the 2015 Cyber Attack, we incurred approximately £60 million of costs (of which £39 million was included as an
exceptional item) in the year ended March 31, 2016 relating to loss of business, investigations, remediation
activity and investment in customer retention. See “—Risks Relating To Legal And Regulatory Matters And
_Litigation—Our business could be adversely affected by legal proceedings and regulatory investigations relating_
_to the 2015 Cyber Attack.” Since the 2015 Cyber Attack we have changed our approach to risk and mitigation_
and implemented a number of monitoring activities, such as vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and the
data loss prevention solution. Although we believe we have successfully mitigated any negative impact of the
2015 Cyber Attack and managed to restore customer confidence, we can provide no assurance that another
successful cyber attack will not occur. Additional cyber attacks on our information systems, or any other
violation of data protection laws, may result in fines, claims for damages, prosecution of relevant employees and
managers, reputational damage and customer churn and may have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects, results of operation and financial condition.

-----

**_If we do not maintain or improve our reputation for the quality of our service, our ability to attract customers_**
**_and retain existing customers may be harmed._**

Our ability to retain customers and to attract new customers depends in part on our brand recognition and
our reputation for the quality of our service. Our reputation and brand may be harmed if we encounter difficulties
in the provision of new or existing services, whether due to technical faults, lack of necessary equipment,
changes to our traditional product offerings, financial difficulties, or for any other reason. Widely publicized
security faults of our systems can be especially harmful. Damage to our reputation and brand could materially
adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

Disruption to services could result in excessive call volumes to call centres that may not be able to cope
with such demand, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our reputation and brand. Our plans for
recovery from, and resilience to, such challenges may not be sufficient. The amount and scope of insurance we
maintain against losses resulting from these events may not be sufficient to cover our losses or otherwise
adequately compensate us for any disruptions to our business that may result.

**_We may fail to adequately monitor and manage customer churn._**

Our industry experiences movement of customers to competitors (the effect known as “churn”) as a result
of, among other things, high levels of competition. See “—We face significant competition in the markets in
_which we operate, which could result in decreases in the number of current and potential customers, revenues_
_and profitability.” Therefore, we focus on monitoring and managing customer churn in our direct, on-net_
customer base. However, it is inherently difficult to accurately ascertain all the precise drivers of churn as some
direct customers may choose to terminate their usage of our services without providing an explanation.

Although we see continued improvement of our churn levels since the 2015 Cyber Attack, such levels still
remain higher than those of our principal competitors in the core markets. See “—If we do not maintain or
_improve our reputation for the quality of our service, our ability to attract customers and retain existing_
_customers may be harmed.” Customer churn could further increase as a result of, among other things: the_
availability of competing services, some of which may be less expensive or technologically superior to those
offered by us or offer content or features that we do not offer; customers moving to areas where we cannot offer
services; customer dissatisfaction with the quality of our customer service, including billing errors or security
breaches; and interruptions in the delivery of services to customers over our network and poor fault management.

Our inability to adequately monitor or control customer churn, or an increase thereof, may lead to a
reduction in revenue and RGUs or increased costs to retain customers, which could have a material adverse effect
on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We operate in a capital-intensive business and may be required to make significant capital expenditure and to_**
**_finance a substantial increase in our working capital to maintain our competitive position. Our capital_**
**_expenditure may not generate a positive return or a significant reduction in costs or promote the growth of our_**
**_business._**

The expansion and operation of our network, as well as the costs of development, sales and marketing of our
products and services, require substantial capital expenditure. In recent years we have undertaken significant
investment to attract and retain customers, including expenditures for equipment and installation costs, the
implementation of new technologies, such as VoIP, and innovative projects, such as our FTTP network in York,
or investment in enhancing existing programmes such as MTTS, which was reconsidered in light of the 2015
Cyber Attack.

As of date of this offering memorandum, we have ongoing capital requirements relating to, among other
things, the following:

   - increases in network capacity as a result of increasing customer demand;

   - continued implementation of MTTS;

   - enhancements of our billing systems;

   - further development of our mobile offerings; and

   - further roll-out of our FTTP network.

However, no assurance can be given that any existing or future capital expenditure will generate a positive
return, result in a significant reduction in costs, or promote the growth of our business. Future capital expenditure

21


-----

may exceed our target level of 6%-7% of revenues and if our investments fail to generate the expected positive
returns or cost reductions, our operations could be significantly adversely affected and future growth could be
significantly curtailed.

In addition, our liquidity and capital requirements may increase if we expand into additional areas of
operation, accelerate the pace of our growth or make acquisitions. If, for any reason, we are unable to obtain
adequate funding to meet these requirements, we may be required to limit our operations and our expansion
plans, including plans to expand our network and service offering. As a result, our operations could be
significantly adversely affected, future growth could be significantly curtailed and our competitive position could
be impaired.

**_Our business may be materially and adversely affected by general business conditions and a worsening of the_**
**_general economy._**

As we operate exclusively in the UK, our success is closely tied to the general economic developments in
the country and cannot be offset by other markets. The profitability of our business may therefore be adversely
affected by a deterioration of general economic conditions in the UK, whether in isolation or as a consequence of
economic conditions or disruptions to European and/or global financial markets. We have benefited from
increased use of telecommunication products in the UK and our future growth and profitability depend on
demand for these services in the coming years. However, economic uncertainty following the UK referendum on
withdrawal from the EU may also result in more cautious spending patterns of both retail and business
customers. If demand does not increase as expected, this could have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects, financial condition and results of operations. See “—The result of the UK’s referendum on withdrawal
_from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our_
_business.”_

In addition, ongoing issues related to sovereign debt in Europe, among other things, have contributed to a
turbulent economic environment. Accordingly, unfavourable economic conditions may impact a significant
number of our customers and, as a result, it may be more difficult for us to maintain ARPU at existing levels,
more likely that customers will downgrade or disconnect their services and more difficult for us to attract new
customers. Should any of these risks materialize, our ability to increase, or, in certain cases, maintain, our
revenue, ARPUs, RGUs, operating cash flow, operating cash flow margins and liquidity could be materially
adversely affected. We are currently unable to predict the extent of any of these potential adverse effects.

**_The result of the UK’s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on_**
**_global economic conditions, financial markets and our business._**

On June 23, 2016, a majority of voters in the UK elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national
referendum. The referendum was advisory, and the terms of any withdrawal are subject to a negotiation period
that could last at least two years after the government of the UK formally initiates a withdrawal process. The
referendum result has created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the UK and the
European Union, including with respect to the laws and regulations that will apply as the UK determines which
European Union-derived laws to replace or replicate in the event of a withdrawal. We may be subject to
increased regulatory and compliance costs should the regulatory regimes diverge between the European Union
and the UK following a withdrawal of the UK from the European Union. Depending on the terms of the
withdrawal, the UK could lose access to the single EU market and to global trade deals negotiated by the
European Union on behalf of its members which could affect the attractiveness of the UK as a global investment
centre and detrimentally impact UK’s growth. These developments, or the perception that any of them could
occur, have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the
stability of global financial markets, and could significantly reduce global market liquidity, restrict the ability of
key market participants to operate in certain financial markets and increase counterparty risk in the UK and the
European Union generally. Asset valuations, currency exchange rates and credit ratings may be especially subject
to increased market volatility. In addition, global economic uncertainty following the UK referendum may also
have an impact on both retail and business customer behaviour. Any of these factors could have an adverse effect
on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects as we may be unable to implement
adequate mitigation strategies.

**_Our business relies on hardware, software and services supplied by third parties. These suppliers may choose_**
**_to discontinue their products or services, seek to charge us prices that are not competitive or choose not to_**
**_renew contracts with us._**

We have important relationships with certain suppliers of hardware, software and services (such as BT,
Huawei, TCS, Tech Mahindra, MDS, Transcom, Wipro and CCI). These suppliers may act in a manner
detrimental to our interests, including, among other things, extend delivery times, supply unreliable equipment,
raise prices and limit or discontinue supply due to their own shortages, business requirements or otherwise. In
many cases, we have made substantial investments in the equipment or software of a particular supplier, making
it difficult for us to find replacement suppliers quickly in the event that a supplier refuses to offer us favourable
prices, ceases to produce the equipment we use or fails to provide the support that we require. In the event that
hardware or software products or related services are defective, or if the suppliers are insolvent, it may be
difficult or impossible to enforce claims in whole or in part against suppliers. The occurrence of any of these
risks may create technical problems, damage our reputation, result in the loss of customers and have a material
adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Further, our contractual
obligations to our customers may exceed the scope of the warranties we have obtained from suppliers.

Where certain business processes are outsourced to third-party providers (such as call-centre services to
Transcom, Wipro and CCI), we are exposed to increased security risks, in particular in relation to customer data,
which may cause financial loss, reputational damage, litigation, regulatory breaches and increased churn. See
“—Sensitive customer data is an important part of our daily business and leakage of such data may violate laws
_and regulations. Any such data security breach, as well as any other failure to fully comply with applicable data_
_protection legislation could result in fines, reputational damage, additional costs and customer churn.”_

The pricing of certain products and services supplied by BT are subject to a regulatory framework
implemented and enforced by Ofcom. We are exposed, therefore, to risks arising from unfavourable decisions
taken by Ofcom, as well changes to the regulatory framework and the way in which it is implemented.

We are also exposed to risks associated with the potential financial instability of our suppliers. If our
suppliers were to discontinue certain products, fail to provide equipment to meet our specifications, or interrupt
the provision of equipment or services to us, whether as a result of bankruptcy or otherwise and if we were
unable to procure satisfactory substitutes, our business and results of operations could be materially adversely
affected.

**_Our business relies on third-party licenses and other intellectual property arrangements._**

We rely on third-party licenses and other intellectual property arrangements to enable us to conduct our
business. We license or purchase network elements and telecommunication equipment, including hardware,
software and firmware, from various third parties. Although these agreements provide warranties, indemnities
and the right of termination in the event of any breach or threatened breach of any intellectual property rights, we
can provide no assurances that competitors or other third parties will not challenge or circumvent the intellectual
property rights we own or license or that the relevant intellectual property rights are valid, enforceable or
sufficiently broad to protect our interests or will provide us with any competitive advantage. Any loss or
withdrawal of those intellectual property rights could affect our ability to provide our services. See “Risks
_Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Litigation—Claims of third parties that we infringe their_
_intellectual property could significantly harm our financial condition, and defending intellectual property claims_
_may be expensive and could divert valuable company resources.”_

**_Our mobile services rely on the mobile networks of Vodafone and Telefónica UK. The ongoing migration from_**
**_the Vodafone network to the Telefónica UK network exposes us to significant execution risks._**

We currently provide our mobile services based on an MVNO agreement with Vodafone. We are in the
process of testing the migration of customers on the Vodafone network to the Telefónica UK network and intend
to substantially complete the migration process by the end of 2017. Any late delivery of such migration exposes
us to significant execution risks related to, among other things, the failure to benefit from better technical and
economic terms and the physical SIM swaps with customers. See “Business—Products and Services—Services to
_Consumers—Mobile.”_

In addition, our reliance on MVNO arrangements could be jeopardized if the third-party network provider
fails to uphold its service agreements, maintain or deploy its network, or if any of our MVNO arrangements are
unexpectedly terminated. If any of these circumstances arise and we are unable to find a replacement network
operator on a timely basis, we could be prevented from continuing the mobile services that rely on MVNO

23


-----

arrangements. In addition, as our MVNO arrangements conclude we may not be able to renegotiate renewal or
replacement arrangements on the same, or more favourable, terms.

**_Our inability to adequately predict customer demand for data could result in increased costs and decreased_**
**_profitability._**

Customer demand for each of our services may vary over time, and identifying these changes is key to our
success. Any substantial increase of customer demand for data traffic, in particular mobile data, over forecast
levels could result in increased additional costs of making services available to our customers, which, despite
efficiencies arising from increased scale, could have a material adverse effect on the profitability of our business.
See “—If we do not maintain or improve our reputation for the quality of our service, our ability to attract
_customers and retain existing customers may be harmed” and “—We may fail to adequately monitor and_
_manage customer churn.”_

**_We depend almost exclusively on our relationships with third-party content providers, and a failure to acquire_**
**_a wide selection of popular content on acceptable terms could adversely affect our business._**

We provide our customers with access to television programmes and channels through our networks. We
rely on third-party programme providers, such as public and commercial broadcasters, or providers of pay or
on-demand television to supply us with the right to distribute these television programmes and channels.

We offer a broad range of content from different suppliers (including Sky and Netflix) on varying lengths of
contractual term. Our ability to renew those arrangements on economic terms could adversely impact our
business or margins.

Other significant content suppliers include the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, UKTV, Viacom Inc. (including Five),
Discovery Communications Inc., Disney, NBC Universal, Turner (a division of Time Warner Inc.) and BT. Our
dependence on these and other suppliers for content could have a material adverse effect on our ability to provide
attractive content at a reasonable cost. Any loss of content could negatively affect the quality and variety of the
content delivered to our customers. In addition, suppliers could become exclusive providers to other platforms,
including Sky, which would reduce our ability to offer the same or similar content to our customers. With respect
to BT in particular, it is not only a supplier of content to us, but also a joint venture partner in YouView. There
are inherent risks in this arrangement, which arise from having a joint venture partner that is also a major supplier
and a retail competitor. All of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and increase
customer churn.

We may fail to adapt to changes in customer behaviour and consumption trends in relation to TV content
which may leave us unable to recoup any minimum guarantees that we may have in contracts with content
providers.

**_Rapid technological changes may increase competition and render our technologies or services obsolete, and_**
**_we may fail to adapt to or implement new technological developments in a cost efficient manner or at all._**

The UK telecommunication market is characterized by a changing competitive environment partly due to
rapid and significant changes in technology and customer demand and behaviour. We face the risk of our
technology becoming obsolete given the fast pace of technological innovation in our industry and consumer
preferences. We may need to make substantial investments to remain competitive, including investments to
upgrade our networks or obtain licenses for, and develop and install, new technologies. The cost of implementing
these investments could be significant, and there is no assurance that our customers will accept the services
enabled by new technologies to the extent required to generate a rate of return that is acceptable to us. In
addition, we face the risk of unforeseen complications in our deployment of these new services and technologies
and there is no assurance that our original estimates of the necessary capital expenditure for us to offer such
services will be accurate. We may not develop and/or deploy new services and technologies according to
expected schedules. In addition, our new services and technologies may not be commercially viable or cost
effective. Should our services fail to be commercially viable, this could result in additional capital expenditures
or a reduction in profitability. Any such change could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results
of operations and financial condition.

In addition, future competition is difficult to predict due to rapid technological change. For example, new
transmission technologies and means of distributing content, or increased consumer demand for and affordability
of products based on new mobile communication technologies, could trigger the emergence of new competitors
or strengthen the position of existing competitors. There is no guarantee that we will successfully anticipate the

24


-----

demands of the marketplace with regard to new technologies. Any failure to do so could affect our ability to
attract and retain customers and generate revenue growth, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations. Conversely, we may overestimate the demand in the
marketplace for certain new technologies and services. If the market does not accept our new technologies or
services, our revenues, margins and cash flows may be adversely affected, and as a result we may not recover
any investment made to deploy such new technology or service. Our future success depends on our ability to
anticipate, react and adapt in a timely manner to technological changes and customer demand and preferences.
We may be required to make substantial capital expenditure and invest in access related or enabling technologies
in order to introduce and integrate new products and services and respond to technological advances and
emerging industry standards. Failure to do so could negatively affect our competitive position, business,
prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may be unable to attract and retain key personnel, directors, managers, employees and other individuals_**
**_without whom we may not be able to implement our business strategy and manage our business effectively._**

We depend on the availability and continued service of a relatively small number of key managers,
employees and other individuals, including our founders, directors and senior managers. These key individuals
are heavily involved in the daily operation of our business and are, at the same time, required to make strategic
decisions, ensure their implementation and manage and supervise development. The loss of any of these key
individuals could significantly impede our financial plans, product development, network expansion, marketing
and other plans. In addition, competition for qualified executives in the telecommunication industry in the
markets in which we operate is intense. Our future operating results depend, in a significant part, upon the
continued contributions of our existing management and our ability to expand our senior management team by
adding highly skilled new members, who may be difficult to identify and recruit. If any of our senior executives
or other key individuals ceases their employment or engagement with us, our business, prospects, results of
operation and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.

**_Concerns about perceived or actual health risks relating to the use of mobile handsets may materially_**
**_adversely affect the prospects of our mobile business._**

Media and other reports have linked radio frequency emissions from mobile handsets to various health
concerns, including cancer, and interference with various electronic medical devices, including hearing aids and
pacemakers. In particular, in May 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the
World Health Organization, classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as “possibly carcinogenic” to
humans based on an increased risk for adverse health effects associated with wireless phone use. The World
Health Organization is expected to release its Environmental Health Criteria on Radio Frequency Fields,
containing new recommendations on radio frequency emissions in the near future. Concerns over radio frequency
emissions may discourage the use of mobile handsets.

If there is sound scientific evidence of a link between radio frequency emissions and health concerns or if
concerns about such health risks increase in the UK, the prospects and results of operations of our mobile
business could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the actual or perceived health risks associated with
electromagnetic radio emissions and wireless communications devices and antennas and the resulting costs and
lowered usage, as well as any related potential new regulatory measures, could have a material adverse effect on
our business, results of operations and financial condition.

**_We may undertake future acquisitions on an opportunistic basis, which may increase our risk profile, distract_**
**_our management or increase our expenses._**

Historically, our growth has been partly due to acquisitions (e.g., AOL UK in 2007, Tiscali UK and Pipex in
2009, broadband and voice customer bases from both Virgin Media and Tesco and tIPicall, a VoIP provider, in
2015). We may undertake, on an opportunistic basis, additional acquisitions in the future. However, we may not
be successful in our efforts to estimate the financial effects of any such transactions on our business. In addition,
acquisitions may divert management attention or financial or other resources away from our existing business or
require additional expenditures. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results
of operations and financial condition.

Our ability to acquire new businesses may be limited by many factors, including availability of financing,
the covenants of our financing agreements, the prevalence of complex ownership structures among potential
targets, government regulation and competition from other potential acquirers. If we make acquisitions, there can
be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the customer base of businesses we acquire, generate expected

25


-----

margins or cash flows or realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions, including growth or expected
synergies. Although we analyse acquisition targets, those assessments are subject to a number of assumptions
concerning profitability, growth, interest rates and company valuations. There can be no assurance that our
assessments of and assumptions regarding acquisition targets will prove to be correct, and actual developments
may differ significantly from our expectations.

Even if we successfully acquire new businesses, we may have difficulties integrating with the new
businesses for a variety of reasons, including differing cultures, management styles and systems, inadequate
infrastructure and poor records or internal controls. In addition, integrating any potential new acquisitions may
require significant initial cash investments and present significant costs, which may result in changes in our
capital structure, including the incurrence of additional indebtedness, tax liabilities or regulatory fines. The
process of integrating businesses may be disruptive to our operations and may cause an interruption of, or a loss
of momentum in, such businesses or a decrease in our operating results as a result of costs, challenges,
difficulties or risks, including: realizing economies of scale in interconnection, content and network operations;
eliminating duplicative overhead expenses; integrating personnel, networks, financial systems and operational
systems; unforeseen legal, regulatory, contractual and other issues; unforeseen challenges from operating in new
geographic areas; and the diversion of management’s attention from our day-to-day business as a result of the
need to deal with the foregoing challenges, disruptions and difficulties.

Furthermore, even if we are successful in integrating our existing and new businesses, expected synergies
and cost savings may not materialize as anticipated or at all, resulting in lower than expected profit margins.
There is no assurance that we will be successful in acquiring new businesses or realizing any of the anticipated
benefits of the companies that we may acquire in the future. If we undertake acquisitions but do not realize these
benefits, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely
affected.

**_The interests of our controlling shareholder may not always coincide with those of the holders of the Notes._**

Sir Charles Dunstone privately holds a 30.8% voting share in the capital in the Issuer and is a controlling
shareholder within the definition set out in the listing rules of the London Stock Exchange. See “Principal
_Shareholders.” As a result, he has, and after the Issue Date will continue to have, directly or indirectly, the power_
to affect our legal and capital structure and our day-to-day operations. There may be circumstances in which our
controlling shareholder may have different objectives from the holders of the Notes, particularly if we encounter
financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts when due. Our controlling shareholder could also have an
interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in his judgment, could
enhance his equity investment, although such transactions might involve risks to the holders of the Notes. In
addition, we might not be aware of all related party transactions, which may involve risks of conflicts of interest
that result in concluding transactions on less favorable terms than could be obtained in arm’s length transactions.
However, we have entered into a written and legally binding agreement with Sir Charles Dunstone under which
he has agreed to comply with the independence provisions set out in the listing rules of the London Stock
Exchange.

**_We may be adversely affected by risks associated with joint ventures._**

We are party to several joint ventures, such as YouView (a joint venture with BT, BBC, ITV, Channel 4,
Channel 5 and Arqiva) that forms the basis of our TV platform and a joint venture with Sky for the roll-out of
FTTP in York. We have pursued and may continue to pursue significant investments in certain strategic
development projects with third parties. Joint ventures often require unanimous approval of the parties to the
joint venture or their representatives for certain fundamental decisions. If a unanimous decision is not reached
when required, it could lead to a deadlock in the operations of the joint venture. Additionally, differences in
views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues. Any
failure of such joint venture participants to meet their obligations to us or to third parties, or any disputes with
respect to the parties’ respective rights and obligations, could have a material adverse effect on the joint venture
and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial
condition.

**_Our insurance may not cover all potential losses, liabilities and damage related to our business and certain_**
**_risks are uninsured or are not insurable._**

We maintain an insurance policy in respect of our critical communications equipment at our data centres
and at certain key network nodes throughout the UK for the services we provide. Our insurance may not be

26


-----

adequate to cover all of our potential losses or liabilities. Moreover, we can provide no assurance that insurance
will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all. At present, we have no coverage
for business interruption or loss of key management personnel and a substantial proportion of our assets is not
insured. If a significant event affects one of our facilities or networks, we could experience substantial property
loss and significant disruptions in the provision of our services for which we would not be compensated.
Additionally, depending on the severity of the property damage, we may not be able to rebuild damaged property
in a timely manner or at all. We do not maintain separate funds or otherwise set aside reserves for these types of
events. Any such loss or third-party claim for damages could have a material adverse effect on our business,
prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Any downgrade of our credit ratings by an international rating agency could have a negative impact on our_**
**_business._**

Any adverse revisions to our credit ratings for domestic or international debt by international rating agencies
may adversely impact the credit rating of the Notes, our ability to raise additional financing and the interest rates
and other commercial terms under which such additional financing is available. This could hamper our ability to
obtain financing for capital expenditures and to refinance or service our indebtedness, which could have a
material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.

**_Changes to IFRS standards for lease accounting and revenue recognition may adversely affect our financial_**
**_results._**

Changes to IFRS have been proposed in recent years, and further changes may be proposed in the future.
Following a detailed consultation period which began in July 2016, the International Accounting Standards
Board (“IASB”) released a new standard (“IFRS 16”) on lease accounting which will replace IAS 17 “Leases”
and which will be effective for financial reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019. IFRS 16 could
have an impact on the assets and liabilities recorded in our balance sheet and the nature of costs recorded in our
income statement. Although there are some exceptions, we, as lessees, would be required to record the majority
of operating leases on the balance sheet as liabilities, at the present value of the expected future payments, along
with an asset reflecting the right to use the asset over the lease term. Currently, operating leases are accounted for
in the income statement as an expense in the period incurred. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”_

Additionally, IFRS 15, adopted on May 28, 2014, established a comprehensive framework for determining
whether, how much and when revenue is recognized from contracts with customers. IFRS 15 is effective for
financial reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018 and replaces existing revenue guidance,
including IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and IFRIC 13 Customer Loyalty Programs. Under
IFRS 15, revenue must be recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to
be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. IFRS 15 will principally affect post-paid arrangements used
by telecommunication operators as regards unbundling of revenues (including any subsidized items), accounting
for changes in contracts, accounting for subscriber acquisition costs and loyalty programmes.

These and any other changes to IFRS that may be proposed in the future could materially adversely affect
our financial condition and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS AND LITIGATION**

**_We are subject to significant regulation at UK and EU level._**

Our principal business activities are regulated and supervised by Ofcom and the UK Competition and
Markets Authority (“CMA”), among other regulators. Regulations in the communications sector at both the UK
and EU level are constantly changing. Changes in laws, regulations or governmental policy affecting our
activities and the activities of our competitors could significantly influence how we operate our business and
introduce new products and services. For example, regulatory changes relating to our activities and the activities
of our competitors, such as changes relating to third-party access to infrastructure, the costs of interconnection
with other networks, our relationships with third-party content providers and broadcasters, the prices of
competing products and services, or any change in policy allowing more favourable conditions for other
operators, could adversely affect our ability to set prices, enter new markets or control our costs. In particular,
following the transposition of recent amendments to EU directives into UK law, Ofcom may attempt to use the
non-significant market power access provisions to require us to provide access to our products. In addition,
Ofcom may look to impose regulation on the cable network, which is currently unregulated. Such regulation
would allow customers to switch with ease to another provider without informing us.

27


-----

In addition, our business and the industry in which we operate are subject to investigation by regulators,
which could lead to enforcement actions, fines and penalties or the assertion of private litigation claims and
damages. Any such action could harm our reputation and result in increased costs to the business.

We are also subject to accreditation requirements with respect to certain of our B2B products and services
provided to public sector organizations in the UK. We have security accreditations across a range of B2B
products and services for public sector organizations in the UK, which are granted subject to periodic reviews of
our policies and procedures by UK governmental entities. If we were to fail to maintain an accreditation or to
obtain a new one when required, it could impact our ability to provide certain offerings to the public sector.

**_Our business could be adversely affected by legal proceedings and regulatory investigations relating to the_**
**_2015 Cyber Attack._**

We may become subject to legal actions brought by existing and past subscribers as a result of, among other
things, the 2015 Cyber Attack and any other severe customer data security breaches. We can provide no
assurance that we will obtain a successful outcome of any such legal action or that our cash flow will be
sufficient to cover any such future claims against us. Any adverse outcome with respect to such claims would
impact our profitability and cash flow and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and
financial condition. In addition, if these claims rise to a level of frequency or size that is significantly higher than
similar claims made against our competitors, our reputation and business would likely be harmed.

In addition, we were the subject of an investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office (the “ICO”),
the UK’s independent authority set up to uphold information right in the public interest. On October 5, 2016, the
ICO found that we knew or ought to have envisaged the risks resulting in the 2015 Cyber Attack and failed to
take reasonable steps to prevent them, thereby committing a serious contravention of the seventh data protection
principle of a kind that was likely to cause substantial damage and substantial distress. As a result, the ICO
imposed a monetary penalty in the sum of £400,000, the highest imposed by the ICO to date. Because we paid
the penalty in full by November 1, 2016, its amount was automatically reduced by 20% to £320,000. The matter
before the ICO is therefore closed.

**_Claims of third parties that we infringe their intellectual property could significantly harm our financial_**
**_condition, and defending intellectual property claims may be expensive and could divert valuable resources._**

We operate in an industry characterized by frequent disputes over intellectual property. As the number of
convergent product offerings and overlapping product functions increase, the possibility of intellectual property
infringement claims against us may correspondingly increase. Any such claims or lawsuits, whether with or
without merit, could be expensive and time consuming to defend, could cause us to cease offering our products
that incorporate the challenged intellectual property, or could require us to develop non-infringing products or
services, if feasible, which could divert the attention and resources of technical and management personnel. In
addition, we can provide no assurance that we would prevail in any litigation related to infringement claims
against us. A successful claim of infringement against us could result in a requirement to pay significant
damages, cease the development or sale of certain products and services that incorporate the challenged
intellectual property, obtain licenses from the holders of such intellectual property, which may not be available
on commercially reasonable terms, or otherwise redesign those products to avoid infringing upon others’
intellectual property rights.

Moreover, we consider certain of our registered trademarks and trade names, including “TalkTalk”, to be
material to our business, the infringement on which could harm our reputation and lead to decreased subscribers
and revenue, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of
operation.

**_We may be subject to fines, awards of damages or other penalties arising from legal proceedings, contractual_**
**_claims and disputes, as well as negative publicity arising therefrom._**

We are involved in legal proceedings from time to time, which may lead to the imposition of damages, fines
or other penalties on us. We may be adversely affected by other contractual claims, complaints and litigation,
including from counterparties with whom we have contractual relationships, customers, competitors or regulatory
authorities, as well as any adverse publicity that we may attract. Any such litigation, complaints, contractual
claims, or adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operation
and financial condition.

28


-----

**RISKS RELATING TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION**

**_Our leverage and debt servicing obligations could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results_**
**_of operations and financial condition._**

As at September 30, 2016, after giving effect to the Refinancing, our total debt would have been
£880 million and our leverage ratio would have been 2.8x. For computations of our total debt and leverage ratio
see “Summary—Summary Financial and Other Information—Other financial data and ratios.” On the Issue
Date, the Issuer expects to (a) issue the Notes; and (b) use the proceeds of the Offering, together with cash on
balance sheet, to (i) repay the drawings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility in full and (ii) partially repay
the drawings under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and the Term Loan Facility. See “Use of Proceeds”,
_“Capitalization” and “Description of Other Indebtedness.”_

Our leverage can have important consequences for our business and operations, including:

   - making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to the Notes and our other debt and
liabilities;

   - requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt,
thus reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund internal growth through working capital and capital
expenditures and for other general corporate purposes;

   - increasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business or economic or industry conditions;

   - placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt in relation to
cash flow;

   - limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry;

   - negatively impacting credit terms with our creditors;

   - restricting us from exploiting certain business opportunities; and

   - limiting our ability to borrow additional funds or raise equity capital in the future and increasing the costs
of such additional financings.

Any of these or other consequences or events could have a material adverse effect on our ability to satisfy
our debt obligations, including under the Notes and the Guarantees.

**_We may incur additional indebtedness prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date, which_**
**_indebtedness could further increase our leverage and may have terms that are more or less favourable than_**
**_the terms of the Notes and our other existing indebtedness._**

We may incur substantial additional debt, including in connection with a refinancing of our existing debt, to
fund any future acquisition or for general corporate purposes. In connection with our financial strategy, we
continually evaluate different financing alternatives, and we may decide to enter into new credit facilities, access
the debt capital markets or incur other indebtedness from time to time, including following the consummation of
the Offering and prior to, or within a short time period following, the Issue Date. Any such offering or incurrence
of debt will be made at our election, and if such debt is in the form of securities, would be offered and sold
pursuant to, and on the terms described in, a separate offering document. The interest rate with respect to any
such additional debt will be set at the time of the pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be less than or
greater than the interest rate applicable to the Notes and our other existing debt, including, in the case of a
refinancing, the debt that is being refinanced, which would have a corresponding effect on our cash interest
expense on a pro forma basis. In addition, the maturity date of any such additional debt will be set at the time of
pricing or incurrence of such debt and may be earlier or later than the maturity date of the Notes and our other
existing debt. The other terms of such additional debt would be as agreed with the relevant lenders or holders
thereof and could be more or less favourable than the terms of the Notes or our other existing indebtedness.
There can be no assurance that we will elect to raise any such additional debt or that any effort to raise such debt
will be successful, and there can be no assurance as to the timing of such offering or incurrence, the amount or
terms of any such additional debt. If we incur new debt in addition to our current debt and the Notes, the related
risks that we now face, even in a refinancing transaction, as described above and elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”
section, could intensify.

29


-----

**_We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our ability to finance our future operations and_**
**_capital needs to pursue business opportunities and activities._**

Among other things, the Indenture limits our ability to:

   - incur or guarantee additional indebtedness;

   - pay dividends, redeem capital stock and make certain investments;

   - make certain other restricted payments;

   - create or permit to exist certain liens;

   - impose restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments to the
Issuer;

   - transfer or sell assets;

   - consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets; and

   - enter into certain transactions with affiliates.

In addition, USPP Notes, the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility and the Bilateral
Agreements contain covenants that limit our ability to incur and assume debt and/or require us to maintain a
certain debt to consolidated EBITDA ratio and a certain consolidated EBITDA to net interest ratio. Further, the
USPP Notes, the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility and the Bilateral Agreements limit,
among other things, our ability to acquire or sell certain assets, to undergo certain corporate actions (such as
mergers and de-mergers), to create security over our assets and to open or maintain bank accounts or to enter into
banking relationships with certain financial institutions. See “Description of Other Indebtedness.”

All of these limitations are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications. See “Description of the
_Notes—Certain Covenants” and “Description of Other Indebtedness.” These covenants could limit our ability to_
finance our future operations and capital needs and our ability to pursue acquisitions and other business activities
that may be in our interest.

If we fail to comply with any of these covenants, we will be in default under the Indenture and the relevant
debt instruments, as the case may be, and the Trustee, the holders of the Notes or the applicable creditors could
declare the principal and accrued interest on the Notes or the applicable amounts due and payable, after any
applicable cure period. In addition, any such default could lead to an event of default and acceleration under our
other debt instruments that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions, including the Indenture. These
restrictions could materially adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or engage in
other business activities that may be in our best interest. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants” and
_“Description of Other Indebtedness.”_

**_Any impairment of our ability to draw funds under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility and the Bilateral_**
**_Agreements could materially adversely affect our business operations._**

Our operations have been primarily financed using cash generated in our operations and debt financing. We
rely on our senior revolving credit facilities under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, as well as the Bilateral
Agreements to fund our business operations and for various other purposes. Further, if we were unable to draw
funds under our senior revolving credit facilities, we may need to find alternative sources of funds which may be
at higher interest rates. There also can be no assurance that we will have sufficient cash resources on hand at any
given time to meet our expenses or debt servicing requirements. Our ability to draw on the 2014 Revolving
Credit Facility or the Bilateral Agreements depends on, among other things, our ability to maintain certain ratios.
Our ability to meet these financial ratios and other required conditions to drawing could be affected by a number
of factors, including by events beyond our control. In addition, our inability to maintain these financial ratios
may also result in an event of default under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility or the Bilateral Agreements,
which would prohibit us from drawing funds under those facilities and potentially trigger a cross-default under
the Notes or our other debt instruments. See “—We are subject to restrictive debt covenants that may limit our
_ability to finance our future operations and capital needs to pursue business opportunities and activities.” This_
inability to draw funds under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility or the Bilateral Agreements or to maintain our
operations due to a lack of cash flow could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of
operations and financial condition.

30


-----

**_We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our operations. Our ability to generate_**
**_cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to generate sufficient cash to_**
**_service our debt._**

Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, and to fund working capital and to make
capital expenditures, will depend on our future operating performance and ability to generate sufficient cash.
This depends on the success of our business strategy and on economic, financial, competitive, market, legislative,
regulatory and other factors, as well as the factors discussed in this “Risk Factors” section, many of which are
beyond our control.

We can provide no assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that
future debt or equity financings will be available to us to pay our debt, including payments due under the Notes
and the Guarantees, when due or to fund our other capital requirements or any operating losses. If our future cash
flows from operations and other capital resources (including borrowings under the 2014 Revolving Credit
Facility or the Bilateral Agreements) are insufficient to pay our obligations as they mature or to fund our liquidity
needs, we may be forced to:

   - reduce or delay our business activities or capital expenditures;

   - sell assets;

   - obtain additional debt or equity capital;

   - restructure or refinance all or part of our debt, including the Notes, on or before maturity; or

   - forego opportunities such as acquisitions of other businesses.

We can provide no assurance that we will be able to accomplish these alternatives on a timely basis or on
satisfactory terms, if at all. Any failure to make payments on the Notes on a timely basis would likely result in a
reduction of our credit rating, which could also harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. In addition, the
terms of our debt, including the Notes, limit, and any future debt may limit, our ability to pursue any of these
alternatives. Any refinancing of our indebtedness could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply
with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business and adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any assets which we could be required to
dispose of can be sold or that, if sold, the timing of such sale and the amount of proceeds realized from such sale
will be acceptable.

**_We may not be able to refinance maturing debt on terms that are as favourable as those from which we_**
**_previously benefited or on terms that are acceptable to us or at all._**

Our ability to refinance our debt depends on a number of factors, including the liquidity and capital
conditions in the credit markets, and we may not be able to do so on satisfactory terms, or at all. In the event that
we cannot refinance our debt, we may not to be able to meet our debt repayment obligations. In addition, the
terms of any refinancing indebtedness may be materially more burdensome to us than the indebtedness it
refinances. Such terms, including additional restrictions on our operations and higher interest rates, could have an
adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.

Furthermore, our inability to meet repayment obligations under the existing agreements could trigger
various cross-default and cross-acceleration provisions, resulting in the acceleration of a substantial portion (if
not all) of our debt, including the Notes, and materially adversely affect our business, prospects, results of
operations and financial condition.

**_We are subject to currency and interest rate risks._**

We are subject to certain limited currency exchange rate risks because substantially all of our revenues and
operating expenses are paid in pounds sterling, but we pay interest and principal obligations with respect to a
portion of our indebtedness in U.S. dollars. To the extent that the pound sterling declines in value against the
U.S. dollar, the effective cost of servicing our U.S. dollar denominated debt will be higher. Changes in the
exchange rate result in foreign currency gains or losses. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
_Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks.”_

We are also subject to interest rate risks as we have certain interest determined on a variable basis, either
through unhedged variable rate debt or derivative hedging contracts. We also incur costs in U.S. dollars and
euros in the ordinary course of our business, including for customer premises equipment and network

31


-----

maintenance services. Any deterioration in the value of the pound sterling relative to the U.S. dollar or the euro
could cause an increase in the effective cost of purchases made in these currencies as only part of these exposures
are hedged. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
_Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks.”_

**_We are subject to credit risks._**

We are exposed to various credit risks and other financial risks that may have a negative impact on our
operating results. Due to the nature of our operations, we are creditors to numerous counterparties, including our
customers, investments in joint ventures, derivative financial instruments, which subjects us to credit risk
associated with those counterparties. These contractual arrangements, deposits or other financial instruments
expose us to credit risk on the amounts due from such counterparties. Our exposure to credit risk could materially
affect our financial condition and results of operations. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
_Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risks.”_

**_Derivative transactions may expose us to unexpected risk and potential losses._**

We are party to certain derivative transactions, such as interest rate, currency and cross-currency swap
contracts, with financial institutions to hedge against certain financial risks. These derivative financial
instruments, which are cash flow hedges, are reported in profit and loss, and accordingly could materially affect
our reported results in any period. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
_Results of Operations—Derivative Financial Instruments.” Moreover we may be exposed to the risk that our_
counterparty in a derivative transaction may be unable to perform its obligations as a result of being placed in
receivership or otherwise. In the event that a counterparty to a material derivative transaction is unable to
perform its obligations thereunder, we may experience losses that could materially adversely affect our financial
condition, financial returns and results of operations.

**RISKS RELATING TO THE NOTES AND THE GUARANTEES**

**_The Notes and the Guarantees are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other obligations of our_**
**_non-guarantor subsidiaries._**

Only the Guarantors will provide the Guarantees for the benefit of the holders of the Notes on the Issue
Date. Other subsidiaries of the Issuer may guarantee the Notes in the future, but until then, any claim by us or
any of our creditors, including the holders of the Notes, against any such non-guarantor subsidiaries will be
structurally subordinated to all of the claims of creditors of such subsidiaries. The Indenture does not limit the
transfer of assets to, or the making of investments in, any of our Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined therein),
including our subsidiaries that do not provide guarantees for the Notes, which subsidiaries could account for a
higher portion of our assets, liabilities, revenues and net results in the future. The Guarantors represented 94.9%
of our headline revenue, 87.2% of our headline EBITDA and 96.7% of our total assets for the year ended
March 31, 2016; and 94.8% of our headline revenue, 85.6% of our headline EBITDA and 96.7% of our total
assets for the six months ended September 30, 2016. As at September 30, 2016, our direct and indirect
subsidiaries that do not guarantee the Notes did not have any material financial indebtedness outstanding. In the
event of insolvency, liquidation or other reorganization of any of these non-guarantor subsidiaries, creditors of
such non-guarantor subsidiaries will generally be entitled to payment in full from their respective assets before
the Issuer or any of the Guarantors is entitled to receive any distribution from such assets as equity holders.
Except to the extent that the Issuer or any of the Guarantors may itself be a creditor with recognized claims
against a non-guarantor subsidiary, claims of creditors of such non-guarantor subsidiary will have priority with
respect to the assets and earnings of that subsidiary over the claims of the Issuer or the Guarantors as equity
holders, although there is no assurance that the claims of the Issuer or any of the Guarantors as a creditor against
a non-guarantor subsidiary may not be reduced, limited or extinguished as a result of applicable insolvency rules
(such as the doctrine of equitable subordination or the rules regarding the potential avoidance of transactions
concluded with related persons within a certain hardening period). Our non-guarantor subsidiaries are also
subject to liabilities to other creditors as a result of obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business, which
liabilities are also effectively senior to the Notes and the Guarantees.

32


-----

**_Claims of the secured creditors of the Issuer or the Guarantors will have priority with respect to their_**
**_collateral over the claims of unsecured creditors, such as the holders of the Notes, to the extent of the value of_**
**_the assets securing such indebtedness._**

The Notes and the Guarantees will not be secured by any of the Issuer’s or the Guarantors’ assets. As a
result, claims of the secured creditors of the Issuer will have priority with respect to the assets securing their
indebtedness over the claims of holders of the Notes. As such, the Notes and the Guarantees will be effectively
subordinated to any existing and future secured indebtedness and other secured obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors, as the case may be, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness or other
obligations (except to the extent such assets in the future also secure the Notes and the Guarantees on an equal
and rateable basis or priority basis). In the event of any foreclosure, dissolution, winding up, liquidation,
reorganization, administration or other bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding of the Issuer or any Guarantor at a
time when it has secured obligations, holders of secured indebtedness will have priority claims to the assets of
the Issuer or such Guarantor that constitute their collateral (other than to the extent such assets in the future also
secure the Notes and the Guarantees on an equal and rateable basis). The holders of the Notes will participate
rateably with all holders of the unsecured indebtedness of the Issuer and the Guarantors, and potentially with all
their other respective general creditors, based upon the respective amounts owed to each holder or creditor, in the
remaining assets of the Issuer and the Guarantors, as the case may be. The claims of holders of the Notes and
other unsecured creditors will also depend on whether there is any value left in the bankruptcy estate besides any
secured assets. If any of the secured indebtedness of the Issuer or any Guarantor becomes due or the creditors
thereunder proceed against the operating assets that secure such indebtedness, our assets remaining after
repayment of that secured indebtedness may not be sufficient to repay all amounts owing in respect of the Notes.
As a result, holders of Notes may receive less, rateably, than holders of secured indebtedness of the Issuer or the
Guarantors.

**_Many of the covenants in the Indenture will be suspended if the Notes are rated investment grade._**

Many of the covenants contained in the Indenture will be suspended if the Notes are rated investment grade
by at least two of Standard & Poor’s Ratings Service, Moody’s Investors Services and Fitch Ratings Inc.,
provided at such time no default under the Indenture has occurred and is continuing. These covenants will be
suspended for the duration of the period during which the Notes maintain an investment grade rating and include
covenants that restrict, among other things, our ability to pay dividends, to incur debt and to enter into certain
other transactions. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever be rated investment grade, or that if they
are rated investment grade, the Notes will maintain such ratings. Suspension of these covenants, however, would
allow us to engage in certain transactions that would not be permitted while these covenants were in force, and
such transactions will not result in a breach of the Indenture if the Notes fail to maintain an investment grade
rating. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of
_Investment Grade Status.”_

**_Early redemption of the Notes may reduce the yield expected by the holders of the Notes._**

The Notes may be redeemed at the option of the Issuer as more fully described in “Description of the
_Notes.” In the event that the Issuer exercises the option to redeem the Notes, the holders of the Notes may suffer_
a lower than expected yield and may not be able to reinvest the funds on the same terms.

**_Each Guarantee may be subject to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws_**
**_or subject to certain limitations or defenses that may limits validity and enforceability._**

Each Guarantee will provide the holders of the Notes with a direct claim against the relevant Guarantor.
However, the Indenture provides that each Guarantee will be limited to the maximum amount that may be
guaranteed by the relevant Guarantor without, among other things, rendering the relevant Guarantee, as it relates
to that Guarantor, voidable or otherwise ineffective or limited under applicable law or causing the officers of the
Guarantor to incur personal civil or criminal liability, and enforcement of each such Guarantee would be subject
to certain generally available defences and laws. These laws and defences include those that relate to corporate
benefit and uncommercial transactions, fraudulent conveyance or transfer, voidable preference, financial
assistance, corporate purpose, capital maintenance or similar laws, regulations or defences affecting the rights of
creditors generally. See “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations.”

Under bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance and other laws in England and Wales, Guarantees can
be challenged and a court could (i) declare unenforceable against third parties (including the beneficiaries
thereof) and/or void any legal act performed by a Guarantor (including, without limitation, the granting by it of

33


-----

the Guarantees), (ii) require, if payment had already been made under a Guarantee, that the recipient (and
possibly, subsequent transferees thereof) return the payment to the relevant Guarantor and (iii) take other action
that is detrimental to you, typically if the court found, inter alia, that:

   - the relevant Guarantee was incurred with actual intent to give preference to one creditor over another,
hinder, delay or defraud any present or future creditors or shareholders of the Guarantor or, when the
granting of the Guarantee has the effect of giving a creditor a preference over another when the
Guarantors contemplated filing for insolvency or the Guarantors subsequently entered an insolvency
process or when the recipient was aware that the Guarantor was insolvent or it would be rendered
insolvent when it granted the relevant Guarantee or security interest;

   - the Guarantor did not receive fair consideration or consideration of equivalent value in money or money’s
worth or corporate benefit for the relevant Guarantee and the Guarantor was: (i) insolvent or rendered
insolvent because of the relevant Guarantee; (ii) undercapitalized or became undercapitalized because of
the relevant Guarantee; or (iii) intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, indebtedness beyond its
ability to pay at maturity;

   - the Guarantor incurred debts beyond its ability to pay those debts as they mature;

   - the relevant Guarantees were held to exceed the corporate objects of the Guarantor or not to be in the best
interests or for the corporate benefit of the Guarantor; or

  - the amount paid or payable under the relevant Guarantee was in excess of the maximum amount
permitted under applicable law.

These or similar laws may also apply to any future guarantee granted by any of our subsidiaries under the
Indenture. Limitations on the enforceability of judgments obtained in New York courts could limit the
enforceability of any Guarantee against any Guarantor. See “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability
_Considerations.”_

**_We may not be able to obtain the funds required to repurchase the Notes upon a change of control._**

The Notes contain provisions relating to certain events constituting a “change of control” in relation to the
Issuer. Upon the occurrence of a change of control, the Issuer is required to make an offer to purchase all
outstanding Notes at a price equal to 101% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and
additional amounts, if any. If a change of control were to occur, we can provide no assurance that we will have
sufficient funds to pay the purchase price of the outstanding Notes and any other indebtedness with similar
provisions.

In addition, our other indebtedness may contain restrictions or repayment requirements with respect to
certain events or transactions that could constitute a change of control under the terms of the Indenture, the USPP
Notes, the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan Facility and the Bilateral Agreements. The inability to
purchase the Notes, the USPP Notes, or repay loans under the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility, the Term Loan
Facility or the Bilateral Agreements upon the occurrence of a change of control would constitute an event of
default under the terms and conditions governing the Notes the USPP Notes, the 2014 Revolving Credit Facility,
the Term Loan Facility and the Bilateral Agreements, which would trigger a cross-default under the Notes and
vice versa. See “Description of the Notes—Certain Covenants—Change of Control.”

**_Enforcing your rights as a holder of the Notes may prove difficult._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are organized under the laws of England and Wales. In addition, the Notes,
the Guarantees and the Indenture will be governed by the laws of the State of New York.

In the event of a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar event, proceedings could be initiated in England and
Wales, the United States or both jurisdictions. Any multi-jurisdictional proceeding is likely to be complex and
costly for creditors and otherwise may result in greater uncertainty and delay regarding the enforcement of your
rights. Your rights under the Notes and the Guarantees will be subject to such bankruptcy, insolvency and
administrative laws, and there can be no assurance that you will be able to effectively enforce your rights in such
complex, multiple bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceedings.

In addition, the bankruptcy, insolvency, administrative and other laws of England and Wales may be
materially different from, or be in conflict with those of the United States and other jurisdictions with which you
may be familiar, including in the areas of the rights of creditors, the priority of governmental and other creditors,
the ability to obtain post-petition interest and the duration of the proceedings. The application of these laws, or

34


-----

any conflict among them, could call into question whether any particular jurisdiction’s laws should apply,
adversely affect your ability to enforce your rights under the Notes in the relevant jurisdictions or limit any
amounts that you may receive.

The laws of England and Wales limit the ability of the Guarantors to guarantee debt of other companies. As
a result, a court in those jurisdictions may deem the Guarantees to be invalid or reduce the amount of guaranteed
obligations available to satisfy claims under the Notes. See “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability
_Considerations.”_

**_The insolvency laws of England and Wales may not be as favourable to you as those of another jurisdiction_**
**_with which you may be familiar._**

The Issuer and the Guarantors are incorporated under the laws of England and Wales. Accordingly, and
assuming that the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ centres of main interests (within the meaning of EU Council
Regulation No. 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings, as amended (the “EUIR”)) are in
England and Wales, that there is no change to the situation of the obligors’ centres of main interests and that the
obligors have no establishments elsewhere (assuming that the centres of main interests are located in a
jurisdiction where the EUIR is applicable), insolvency proceedings with respect to any of those entities would be
likely to proceed under, and be governed by, English insolvency law (although this could be challenged and
secondary/ancillary proceedings could be opened in other jurisdictions). English insolvency law may not be as
favourable to investors as the laws of the United States or other jurisdictions with which investors are familiar. In
the event that any one or more of the Issuer or the Guarantors experiences financial difficulty, it is not possible to
predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Provided the centres of main interests of
the Issuer and the Guarantors remain in England and Wales, and those companies do not have establishments in
other jurisdictions at any time, insolvency proceedings relating to the Issuer and the Guarantors are likely to be
commenced in England and Wales. However, the concepts of a company’s centre of main interests and its other
establishments are fluid and factual concepts that may change. To the extent any of the Issuer or the Guarantors
has a centre of main interests or an establishment that is outside England and Wales, other jurisdictions’
insolvency laws may become relevant. See “Certain Insolvency and Enforceability Considerations” with respect
to English insolvency law.

The EU Insolvency Regulation has been replaced by the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European
Parliament and of the Council dated May 20, 2015 (the “New EUIR”) which became effective as of June 26,
2015, and which will be applicable to insolvency proceedings opened after June 26, 2017. The EUIR remains
applicable to insolvency proceedings opened before that date.

The New EUIR includes, among others, specifications regarding the identification of the centre of main
interests. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the New EUIR, the centre of main interests of a company or legal person is
presumed to be located in the Member State of the registered office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That
presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not been moved to another Member State within a three
month period prior to the request for the opening of insolvency proceedings. Specifically, it should be possible to
rebut this presumption where the company’s central administration is located in a Member State other than that
of its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors establishes, in a manner
that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual centre of management and supervision and of the
management of its interests is located in that other Member State. In this regard, special consideration should be
given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the administration of its interests. Another
change under the New EUIR focuses on the definition of “establishment” as a prerequisite to open “territorial
proceedings” (secondary proceedings). From June 26, 2017 onwards, “establishment” will mean any place of
operations where a debtor carries out or has carried out in the three month period prior to the request to open
main insolvency proceedings a non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets.

On June 23, 2016, the UK held a referendum to decide on the UK’s membership of the EU. The UK vote
was to leave the EU. The terms on which the UK will exit the EU are not certain and therefore it is not possible
to know what impact any exit by the UK from the EU will have on the application of EU law (including the EU
Insolvency Regulation or the New EU Insolvency Regulation) to, or in connection with, any insolvency
proceedings (including, without limitation, the commencement of such insolvency proceedings and the
jurisdiction of the UK courts to open such insolvency proceedings) to which the Issuer or any of the Guarantors
may be subject.

**_Credit ratings may not reflect all risks, are not recommendations to buy or hold securities and may be subject_**
**_to revision, suspension or withdrawal at any time._**

One or more independent credit rating agencies may assign credit ratings to the Notes. The credit ratings
address our ability to perform our obligations under the terms of the Notes and credit risks in determining the
likelihood that payments will be made when due under the Notes. The ratings may not reflect the potential
impact of all risks related to the structure, the market, other risk factors discussed in this offering memorandum
and other factors that may affect the value of the Notes. A credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or
hold securities and may be subject to revision, suspension or withdrawal by the rating agency at any time. No
assurance can be given that a credit rating will remain constant for any given period of time or that a credit rating
will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by the credit rating agency if in its judgment circumstances in the
future so warrant. A suspension, reduction or withdrawal at any time of the credit rating assigned to the Notes by
one or more of the credit rating agencies may adversely affect the cost and terms and conditions of our financings
and could adversely affect the value and trading of the Notes.

**_Transfers of the Notes will be subject to certain restrictions._**

The Issuer has not agreed to register and does not intend to register the Notes under the U.S. Securities Act
or any securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction of the United States. The holders of the Notes may not
offer to sell the Notes, except pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable securities laws of any state or any other jurisdiction of the
United States. The Issuer has not undertaken to register the Notes or to effect any exchange offer for the Notes in
the future. Furthermore, the Issuer has not registered and does not intend to register the Notes under any other
country’s securities laws. Prospective investors in the Notes should read the discussion in the section entitled
“Notice to Investors” for further information about these transfer restrictions. It is the obligation of the investors
in the Notes to ensure that their subscription for or subsequent offers, sales or transfers of the Notes comply with
any applicable securities laws.

**_The market value of the Notes could decrease if our creditworthiness worsens._**

The market value of the Notes will suffer if the market perceives us to be less likely to fully perform all
obligations under the Notes when they fall due. This could occur, for example, because of the materialization of
any of the risks listed in this “Risk Factors” section. Even if our ability to fully perform all obligations under the
Notes when they fall due has not actually decreased, market participants could nevertheless have a different
perception. In addition, market participants’ estimation of the creditworthiness of corporate debtors in general or
debtors operating in the same business as us could adversely change, causing the market value of the Notes to
fall. If any of these events occurs, third parties would only be willing to purchase Notes for a lower price than
before the materialization of these risks. Under these circumstances, the market value of the Notes could
decrease.

**_There is no established trading market for the Notes and no assurance that the holders of the Notes will be_**
**_able to sell them._**

There is no existing market for the Notes. We will make an application to the Exchange to list the Notes on
its Official List and admit them to trading thereon, but cannot guarantee the liquidity of any market that may
develop for the Notes, the ability of the holders of the Notes to sell such Notes or the price at which they may be
able to sell such Notes. Liquidity and future trading prices of the Notes depend on many factors, including,
among other things, prevailing interest rates, results of operations, the market for similar securities and general
economic conditions. The Initial Purchasers have informed us that they intend to make a market in the Notes
after completing the Offering. They are not, however, obligated to do so. Any market-making that is commenced
may be halted at any time. In addition, changes in the overall market for high yield securities and changes in our
financial performance in the markets in which we operate may adversely affect the liquidity of any trading
market in the Notes that does develop and any market price quoted for the Notes. As a result, we cannot ensure
that an active trading market will actually develop for the Notes.

Historically, markets for non-investment grade debt such as the Notes have been subject to disruptions that
have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such debt. Any market for the Notes may be subject to similar
disruptions. Any such disruptions may affect the liquidity and trading of the Notes independent of our financial
performance and prospects and may have an adverse effect on the holders of the Notes.

36


-----

**_The Notes may not become, or remain, listed on the Exchange._**

Although the Issuer intends to have the Notes listed on the Official List of the Exchange and admitted to
trading thereon as promptly as practicable following the Issue Date (and, in any event, before the first coupon
payment date in respect of the Notes) and to maintain such listing as long as the Notes are outstanding, the Issuer
cannot assure prospective investors that the Notes will become or remain listed. If the Issuer cannot maintain the
listing of the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange or it becomes unduly onerous to make or maintain such
listing, the Issuer may cease to make or maintain such listing on the Official List of the Exchange, provided that
it will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain and maintain the listing of the Notes on another recognized
listing exchange for high yield issuers, although there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to do so.
Although no assurance is made as to the liquidity of the Notes as a result of listing on the Official List of the
Exchange or another recognized listing exchange for high yield issuers in accordance with the Indenture, failure
to be approved for listing or the delisting of the Notes from the Official List of the Exchange or another stock
exchange in accordance with the Indenture may have a material adverse effect on a holder’s ability to resell the
Notes in the secondary market.

**_Prospective investors may face foreign exchange risks by investing in the Notes._**

The Notes are denominated and payable in British pounds sterling. If prospective investors measure their
investment returns by reference to a currency other than the British pounds sterling, an investment in the Notes
entails foreign exchange related risks due to, among other factors, possible significant changes in the value of the
British pound sterling, relative to the currency by reference to which such prospective investors measure their
returns because of economic, political or other factors over which we have no control. Depreciation of the British
pounds sterling, against the currency by reference to which prospective investors measure their respective
investment returns could cause a decrease in the effective yield of the Notes below their stated coupon rates and
could result in a loss to investors when the return of the Notes is translated into the currency by reference to
which such investors measure their investment returns. There may be tax consequences for prospective investors
as a result of any foreign exchange gains or losses for any investment in the Notes. Please see “Tax
_Considerations.”_

**_The Notes will initially be held in book-entry form and therefore prospective investors must rely on the_**
**_procedures of the relevant clearing systems to exercise any rights and remedies._**

Unless and until the Notes in definitive registered form, or definitive registered Notes, are issued in
exchange for book-entry interests, owners of book-entry interests will not be considered owners or the holders of
the Notes. The common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, or its nominee, will be the sole holder of the
global notes representing the Notes. After payment to the common depositary, we will have no responsibility or
liability for the payment of interest, principal or other amounts to the owners of book-entry interests.

Accordingly, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it must rely on the procedures of Euroclear or
Clearstream, as applicable, and if it is not a participant in Euroclear or Clearstream, on the procedures of the
participant through which it owns its interest, to exercise any rights and obligations as a holder of the Notes. See
“Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.” Unlike the holders of the Notes themselves, owners of book-entry interests
will not have any direct rights to act upon our solicitations for consents, requests for waivers or other actions
from the holders of the Notes. Instead, if an investor owns a book-entry interest, it will be permitted to act only to
the extent it has received appropriate proxies to do so from Euroclear or Clearstream, or if applicable, from a
participant in these systems. There can be no assurance that procedures implemented for the granting of such
proxies will be sufficient to enable investors to vote on any matters or otherwise exercise their rights with respect
to the Notes on a timely basis.

Similarly, upon the occurrence of an event of default, unless and until definitive registered Notes are issued
in respect of all book-entry interests, if an investor owns a book-entry interest it will be restricted to acting
through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable. We can provide no assurance that the procedures to be
implemented through Euroclear or Clearstream, as applicable, will be adequate to ensure the timely exercise of
the investors’ rights under the Notes. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**_The Notes may not be a suitable investment for all investors._**

Each potential investor in the Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own
circumstances. In particular, each potential investor should:

   - have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the merits and risks of
investing in the Notes;

37


-----

   - have access to, and knowledge of, appropriate analytical tools to evaluate, in the context of its particular
financial situation, an investment in the Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall
investment portfolio;

   - have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Notes,
including where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor’s
currency;

   - understand thoroughly the terms of the Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices
and financial markets; and

   - be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic,
interest rate and other factors that may affect their investment and their ability to bear the applicable risks.

Potential investors should not invest in the Notes unless they have the expertise (either alone or with the
help of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions, the resulting
effects on the value of such Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor’s overall
investment portfolio. The investment activities of investors are subject to applicable investment laws and
regulations and/or review or regulation by certain authorities and each potential investor should consult its legal
advisers or the appropriate regulators.

**MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF**
**OPERATIONS**

_The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in_
_conjunction with the information in the sections entitled “Presentation of Financial and Other Data” and_
_“Selected Financial Information” of this offering memorandum. The following discussion should also be read in_
_conjunction with the Financial Statements together with the related notes included elsewhere in this offering_
_memorandum._

_The following discussion includes forward-looking statements based on assumptions about our future_
_business. Our actual results could differ materially from those contained in these forward-looking statements as_
_a result of many factors, including but not limited to those described in the sections entitled “Cautionary Note_
_Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Risk Factors” of this offering memorandum._

**OVERVIEW**

We are the UK’s leading value-for-money provider of fixed-line phone and broadband services to
residential and businesses customers. Our fixed-line services are offered through an extensive and
technologically advanced network, covering approximately 96% of UK’s homes. In addition to our fixed-line
connectivity offerings, we provide pay TV services through our part ownership of the YouView platform and
mobile services through an MVNO arrangement with Vodafone (which we intend to transition to Telefónica UK
during 2017). We offer our phone and broadband services both on a retail and wholesale basis, and leverage our
existing fixed-line customer base and our extensive fixed network to offer dual play (fixed-line phone and
broadband internet), triple play (dual play plus pay TV or mobile) and quad play (dual play plus pay TV and
mobile) products.

Our consumer business offers quad play products incorporating broadband internet, voice, pay TV and
mobile to Retail customers through a simple tariff structure and low prices. Our unique non-subscription pay TV
offering provides flexible access to free and pay-to-view third-party content through the YouView platform. As
at September 30, 2016, we had approximately 3.0 million Retail phone and broadband customers, approximately
1.3 million of which also subscribed to our pay TV service and approximately 793,000 were mobile customers.

Our fast growing B2B division, TTB, offers a wide range of data connectivity and next generation voice
products to businesses across the UK. We provide fixed-line phone, broadband internet (including high speed
Ethernet), data networking and other connectivity solutions to private companies and public sector organizations,
both directly and on a wholesale basis through approximately 850 partners. As at September 30, 2016, we had
approximately 899,000 Wholesale broadband and phone customers, and approximately 39,000 connected data
lines. We are one of only three national network providers in the UK that offer wholesale connectivity services,
broadband, FTTC and Ethernet to large national ISPs, such as the Post Office and Telecom Plus.

In the periods under review, we have consistently generated strong revenues. We had £1,795 million and
£1,838 million of headline revenue for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and £902 million
of headline revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2016. Our headline EBITDA and headline EBITDA
margin increased from £245 million and 13.6%, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2015 to £260 million
and 14.1%, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2016 and £130 million and 14.4% for the six months
ended September 30, 2016. Our capital expenditure cash outflows were £112 million, £166 million and
£99 million for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2016 and six months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively. This represented 6.2%, 9.0% and 11.0% of our headline revenue for the respective periods. In
addition, our leverage ratio was 2.4x, 2.6x and 2.8x for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2016 and the six
months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and our interest coverage ratio was at the level of 11.1x, 11.8x
and 12.0x, respectively, for the same periods.

**RECENT DEVELOPMENTS**

**Interim Dividend for the year ending March 31, 2017**

On December 16, 2016 the Issuer paid an interim dividend for the year ending March 31, 2017 in the
amount of 5.29 p per share, or approximately £50 million.

**New Tariff Plans**

At the beginning of October 2016, we replaced all of our existing consumer connectivity tariffs with a new,
radically simpler range of fixed low price plans. These new plans give customers the freedom to choose and fix

their own package for 18 months by tailoring mix-and-match broadband, mobile, TV and land-line calls to suit
their needs. Customers can choose between two new simple packages, each inclusive of line rental:

   - “Fast Broadband”: for speeds of up to 17Mbps (which also includes (i) our “Essential SIM” feature,
providing 200 minutes, unlimited SMS and 500MB of data and (ii) access to the TalkTalk TV Store); and

   - “Faster Fibre Broadband”: for speeds of up to 38Mbps (which also includes (i) our “Essential SIM”
feature, providing 200 minutes, unlimited SMS and 500MB of data and (ii) access to the TalkTalk TV
Store).

Uniquely in the market, we have also made these new plans available to all of our existing customers (on
legacy tariffs, such as Simply Broadband, Essentials TV and Plus TV) who are able to move to these plans by
re-contracting with us for 18 months. Our existing customers have responded extremely well to the new plans. In
particular: (a) ten times as many customers have re-contracted than in an average month, (b) many more have
chosen the Faster Fibre Broadband plan than expected, (c) attachment rates for calling and TV boosts have also
been stronger than we had expected. These outcomes reflect the attractiveness of our simple and clear pricing,
and while the take up on the new plans might be at a lower ARPU, the 18 months re-contracting will help reduce
churn. Customers who chose not to re-contract have received an approximately 9%-10% price increase on their
existing packages.

**Industry**

In December 2016, Sky announced the launch of its mobile proposition (based on its MVNO agreement
with Telefónica UK). This offering is aimed at its existing fixed-line phone, broadband and TV customer base.
The offering’s data pricing is comparable to the wider UK market.

**Regulation**

In November 2016, Ofcom announced that it intended to mandate legal separation of BTOR from BT after
BT failed to offer voluntary proposals that would address competition concerns to Ofcom’s satisfaction. Such
separation will require BTOR to become a distinct company with its own independent board of directors and
ownership and control of its assets and resources. Ofcom has specifically stated that if legal separation cannot be
made to work, then full structural separation remains an option. Currently Ofcom is considering a more detailed
legal separation proposal. It is expected to notify and consult with the European Commission accordingly in early
2017. Such consultations are required to allow Ofcom to implement the proposed solution.

Whether BT is ultimately structurally or legally separated from BTOR, we expect reductions in the
wholesale price of BTOR’s GEA, and thus a reduction in our wholesale costs. If BTOR is fully separated, it
would be economically rational for the separated entity to support such a price reduction in order to drive take up
on their network from all ISPs.

**BASIS OF FINANCIAL PRESENTATION**

**General**

We prepared our Annual Financial Statements for the years ended March 31, 2014 2015 and 2016 and our
Interim Financial Statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. Our financial year ends on
March 31 of each calendar year. See “Presentation of Financial and Other Data.”

We present income statement items on a headline basis. Headline income statement line items are calculated
by adding non-operating amortisation and exceptional items to statutory income statement line items. A
reconciliation of headline revenue to statutory revenue, headline EBITDA to statutory EBITDA and statutory
EBITDA to statutory operating profit is presented in “—Reconciliation of Headline and Statutory Income
_Statement Items” below._

We present our consolidated Financial Statements in British pound sterling, which is the currency of the
principal economic environment in which we operate.

**Headline Revenue Presentation**

Our Board of Directors generally considers the results of the business as a whole when assessing the
performance of the business and making decisions about the allocation of resources. We have no material
operations outside the UK and as a result, do not split our revenue into geographic segments.

We report headline revenues according to the following structure: (a) on-net revenue, (b) off-net revenue
and (c) corporate revenue. We further break down corporate revenue into (i) carrier revenue, (ii) data revenue and
(iii) voice revenue.

September 30, 2015 and 2016:

**_Headline on-net revenue_**

Headline on-net revenue is generated by our Retail and Wholesale customers who receive services through
our own network. As at September 30, 2016 we had approximately 4 million on-net customers, representing
98.0% of our total customers. These customers generated £1,259 million; £1,333 million; £1,399 million and
£670 million of our headline revenue, or 72.9%; 74.3%; 76.1% and 74.3% of our total headline revenue, for the
years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.

**_Headline off-net revenue_**

Off-net customers are connected with lines leased from BT Wholesale in geographies where we have not
installed our own equipment in the local exchange. On December 24, 2014 we disposed our Consumer off-net
broadband customer base to Fleur Telecom Limited (“Fleur”), a member of Daisy Communications Group to
enable us to simplify our tariffs and enable future systems savings. We currently provide wholesale off-net
services only through TTB to our partner channels such as the Post Office. As at September 30, 2016 we had
69,000 off-net customers, representing 2.0% of our total customers. These customers generated £128 million;
£87 million; £55 million and £24 million of our headline revenue, or 7.4%; 4.8%; 3.0% and 2.7% of our total
headline revenue, for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and six months ended September 30, 2016,
respectively.

**_Headline corporate revenue_**

Headline corporate revenue is generated by B2B customers, to whom we offer services under the TTB
brand. Basic phone and broadband products for B2B customers, primarily home office and small to medium
enterprises (“SME”), are accounted for either as part of our on-net or off-net revenue, as appropriate. Headline
corporate revenue refers exclusively to revenue that we generate by providing large business customers with the
speed and connectivity to support enterprise focused products. Customers generating headline corporate revenue
accounted for £340 million; £375 million; £384 million and £208 million of our headline revenue, or 19.7%;
20.9%; 20.9% and 23.0% of our total headline revenue, for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and
six months ended September 30, 2016, respectively.

The following table presents our headline corporate revenue broken down into (i) carrier revenue, (ii) data
revenue and (iii) voice revenue for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and six months ended

-----

_Carrier revenue_

Carrier revenue is generated by data and voice traffic terminated and/or transited on our extensive UK voice
network with other telecommunication services providers. This trading generated £78 million; £105 million;
£119 million and £72 million of headline revenue, or 22.9%; 28.0%; 30.9% and 34.6% of our total headline
corporate revenue for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and six months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively.

_Data revenue_

Data revenue is generated by our large B2B customers that subscribe to Ethernet and EFM solutions that
represent our fastest growth segment. As at September 30, 2016 we had 39,300 lines. These customers generated
£70 million; £97 million; £120 million and £75 million of headline revenue, or 20.6%; 25.9%; 31.3% and 36.1%
of our total headline corporate revenue for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and six months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively.

_Voice revenue_

Voice revenue is generated by B2B customers that mainly use our legacy voice solutions, a market that has
been contracting over a number of years. On April 22, 2015, we acquired all shares in tIPicall Limited, a
company providing VoIP services. We aim to grow this next generation voice product, as the established trend of
decline in legacy voice solutions continues. These voice revenue customers generated £192 million;
£173 million; £145 million and £61 million of headline revenue, or 56.5%; 46.1%; 37.8% and 29.3% of our total
headline corporate revenue for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and six months ended
September 30, 2016, respectively.

**Reconciliation of Headline and Statutory Income Statement Items**

We present our income statement items on a headline basis. Headline income statement line items are
calculated by adding non-operating amortisation and exceptional items to statutory income statement line items.

**TRENDS AND OTHER KEY FACTORS IMPACTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS**

The following are the key factors that have significantly affected our results of operations and financial
condition during the periods under review, or which we expect will significantly affect our operations in the
future.

**Competition**

Our results of operations are affected by competition, as we operate in competitive industries and compete
with a number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services and
entertainment, news and information content to consumers. Our principal competitors across all our products and
services are BT, Sky and Virgin Media.

The UK telecommunication market structure is experiencing structural changes, as both Ofcom and the
UK Government have acknowledged a need to promote competition and drive investment across the market.
Ofcom is committed to help improve competition among broadband providers by opening up access to BT’s
infrastructure. Ofcom has also proposed to make it easier for consumers to switch providers.

We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages. At the core of our competitive position is our
network that reaches 96% of UK households and our status as an established value-for-money provider of
telecommunication services. We believe that we are well placed to benefit from an increased trend toward a more
competition-friendly regulatory framework in the UK. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to our Business and
_Industry—We face significant competition in the markets in which we operate, which could result in decreases in_
_the number of current and potential customers, revenues and profitability” and “Industry Regulation.”_

**Churn**

Movement of our customers to our competitors (an effect known as “churn”) is a factor which could
negatively affect our customer base growth and revenue. Our business may encounter churn as a result of high
levels of competition. In addition to competitive alternatives, churn levels may be affected by changes in our or
our competitors’ prices, our level of customer satisfaction, brand reputation and trust, the relocation of
subscribers and exceptional effects such as the 2015 Cyber Attack, which resulted in a spike in churn. Increases
in churn may lead to increased subscriber acquisition costs and reduced revenue.

With the exception of one-off events, such as the 2015 Cyber Attack, the key drivers of churn for our
business are predominantly customer service related rather than price driven, as customers tend to leave us for
service related issues rather than because they have found less expensive alternatives. Improving service and
customer experience measures through our MTTS programme has therefore been a key management focus, allied
with driving increased penetration of additional products, which also enhances customer loyalty.

As the majority of our customers are on-net customers, our management focuses on the churn in this
revenue generation group. For the six months ended September 30, 2016 and the years ended March 31, 2016,
2015 and 2014, our average monthly on-net churn was 1.4%, 1.6%, 1.4% and 1.6%, respectively, calculated as a
percentage of on-net customers leaving our network in each of the relevant periods.

We believe that the following factors help to reduce our level of churn:

   - fundamentally, customers have tended to leave our network because of service issues, therefore the most
effective means of reducing churn is to improve the service we provide. Our MTTS programme has been
running for 3 years and is delivering material improvements to our customers’ experience, which helps to
reduce churn throughout the business, see “—Making TalkTalk Simpler (MTTS)”; and

   - we believe that customers who subscribe to multiple services are less likely to leave our services. We aim
to leverage our existing phone and broadband customer base to drive penetration of other products. As at
March 31, 2016, 38.0%, 19.0% and 19.0% of our phone and broadband customer base also subscribed to
our TV, mobile and fibre products, respectively, see “Business—Overview—Strategy—Achieve significant
_scale benefits.”_

**The 2015 Cyber Attack**

In October 2015, our website was subject to a significant and sustained cyber attack.

The 2015 Cyber Attack drove elevated churn for a short period, which led to a loss of approximately 95,000
broadband customers in the third quarter of the year ended March 31, 2016. An extended period through which
we were unable to trade effectively also led to a reprioritisation of a number of initiatives in the MTTS. See
_“—Making TalkTalk Simpler (MTTS).”_

51


-----

We believe that the actions we took following the 2015 Cyber Attack to focus on our existing customers and
to restore normality have more than mitigated any lasting impact on the business. This focus, together with the
customer experience benefits of MTTS, helped us to stabilise the broadband base in the fourth quarter of the year
ended March 31, 2016, drive strong growth in RGUs, recover customer trust and satisfaction according to a
number of metrics and deliver the lowest ever churn in our history of 1.3% in the fourth quarter of the year ended
March 31, 2016. Equally, the learnings from our detailed review of systems and processes following the 2015
Cyber Attack have helped us to prioritise elements of our trading approach and strategy, which are helping us to
deliver future improvements in profitability. The on-net wholesale base was not directly affected by the 2015
Cyber Attack.

We incurred exceptional items in an amount of £42 million in relation to the 2015 Cyber Attack in the year
ended March 31, 2016. These costs included restoring our online capability with enhanced security features,
associated IT, incident response and consultancy costs and providing free upgrades to our customers.

Since the 2015 Cyber Attack we have changed our approach to risk and mitigation and implemented a
number of monitoring activities, such as vulnerability scanning, penetration testing and the data loss prevention
solution. In addition, we have implemented an extensive programme of cultural change, including behaviours,
values and ways of working. See “Business—Overview—Strengths—Strong track record of operational
_improvement.”_

**Making TalkTalk Simpler (MTTS)**

During the year ended March 31, 2013, we began a wide ranging MTTS transformation programme, which
aims to improve our customers’ experience and reduce our costs, through driving process and efficiency
improvements. MTTS comprises detailed initiatives to simplify tariffs and access methods, simplify and upgrade
our systems and networks, make better use of our data and drive increasing online self-service by customers.
Since its implementation, MTTS has been delivering material improvements and incremental cost savings,
reducing our subscriber acquisition costs (“SAC”) through lower churn and costs per add (“CPA”).

During the year ended March 31, 2014, we achieved incremental cost savings of £15 million from our
MTTS programme, together with the continuing benefits of legacy operating efficiency programmes, and
incurred exceptional costs related to MTTS of £20 million (compared with exceptional costs of £7 million for the
year ended March 31, 2013). These costs include work on the implementation of a programme to cease provision
of non-core legacy access methods such as IP Stream, building a detailed roadmap for a Group-wide systems
upgrade, improved data standards and executive level reporting and the launch of our service and billing app
MyTalkTalk on both the iOS and Android platforms. A total tax credit of £5 million has been recognised on
these costs in the year ended March 31, 2014.

During the year ended March 31, 2015, we achieved further incremental cost savings of £17 million from
our MTTS programme, and incurred exceptional project management, consultancy, migration and call centre
costs of £29 million. These costs include work on improving consumer and B2B customer operations, services
and rationalising customer tariffs and exiting Group legacy products and access methods. A total tax credit of
£7 million has been recognised on these costs in the year ended March 31, 2015.

During the year ended March 31, 2016, we achieved incremental cost savings of £21 million from our
MTTS programme through, among other things: (a) better network performance from improved traffic
management and the deployment of faster backhaul circuits; (b) fewer missed engineer appointments and
improved resolution of problem orders through case management; (c) the implementation of live chat and voice
biometrics; (d) improved fault diagnosis and resolution, reducing engineering cost and unnecessary customer
contacts and (e) savings from implementing changes to our organisational structure.

During the year ended March 31, 2016, we incurred exceptional costs of £41 million from the
implementation of the MTTS programme. These costs mainly result from improving customer experience
systems and processes and implementing changes to our organisational structure, exiting office locations and
preparing for the move in April 2017 from our sites in Irlam and Warrington to a new single location at the
Soapworks, Salford. A total tax credit of £8 million has been recognised on these costs in the year ended
March 31, 2016.

Overall, as at September 30, 2016, our total annualized cost savings relating to the MTTS programme since
its implementation amounted to over £70 million.

**Headline EBITDA and impact of exceptional items**

EBITDA is a widely recognised benchmark for measuring profitability and cash-flows in the
telecommunication industry. Therefore, the Board of Directors closely monitors our statutory EBITDA, headline
EBITDA and headline EBITDA margin as key measures of our financial performance. See “—Basis of Financial
_Presentation—Reconciliation of Headline and Statutory Income Statement Items.” None of these are measures of_
financial performance under IFRS as adopted by the EU. They may not be comparable to similarly titled
measures used by other companies. Therefore you should not consider our statutory EBITDA, headline EBITDA
or headline EBITDA margin as substitutes for operating profit or cash flows generated from operating activities
reported in the Financial Statements.

We define “statutory EBITDA” as statutory income before income tax, net finance costs, share of results of
joint ventures, and depreciation and amortisation for the relevant period. We calculate statutory EBITDA by
adding back to our statutory operating profit or loss charges for statutory depreciation, statutory amortisation and
statutory share of results of joint ventures. We define headline EBITDA as statutory EBITDA adjusted for the
effect of exceptional items. Headline EBITDA margin is the ratio of our headline EBITDA for a period to our
headline revenue for the same period.

The table below presents a reconciliation of our headline EBITDA to our statutory EBITDA and our
statutory EBITDA to our statutory operating profit for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and
six months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 were as follows:

2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively. For the six months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016 amortisation includes amortisation of
acquisition intangibles of £5 million.

**Future growth**

Our revenue growth strategy is built upon maintaining a broadly stable to modestly growing base of on-net
households, while driving growth in the number of products taken per household and driving strong growth in
our B2B division through an expanding base of data connections. With respect to our on-net base, which
comprises both wholesale and retail customers, our strategy is focused on driving ARPU through growth in the
penetration of RGUs in the existing base, rather than aggressively growing the base itself. In order to monitor the
growth of our customer base, our management tracks net-adds of customers by product type. Net-adds are the net
of new customers subscribing to our services and customers now discontinuing their subscriptions with us, within
a certain period.

The following table shows our net-adds, by key product, for the years ended March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016
and six months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016:

**_Headline revenue_**

Our headline revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was £902 million, compared with
£912 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of 1.1%.

_Headline on-net revenue_

Headline on-net revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was £670 million, compared with
£697 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of 3.9%. This decrease reflected a
reduction in our on-net customer base, mainly due to our decision to disconnect approximately 72,000
non-paying customers in the six months ended September 30, 2015, arising from a change in credit terms from
180 days to the industry standard of 90 days and approximately 95,000 customers leaving our network due to the
effect of the 2015 Cyber Attack.

_Headline off-net revenue_

Headline off-net revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was £24 million, compared with
£27 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of 11.1%. This decrease reflects the decline
in our wholesale partners’ off-net customer base.

Headline corporate revenue for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was £208 million, compared with
£188 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 10.6%. This increase was primarily
due to strong growth of Carrier headline revenue by 30.9%, to £72 million for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 from £55 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, and Data headline revenue
by 38.9% to £75 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from £54 million for the six months ended
September 30, 2015. The growth in Carrier headline revenue was mainly driven by a specific business win and
increased bilateral and UK transit trading. The growth in Data headline revenue was principally attributable to
approximately 8,600 new connections to our Ethernet and EFM base. This was partially offset by the ongoing
decline in legacy voice revenues by 22.8%, to £61 million for the six months ended September 30, 2016 from
£79 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015.

**_Headline cost of sales_**

Headline cost of sales for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was £433 million, compared with
£425 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 1.9%. This increase was primarily due
to an increase in low-margin Carrier trading; where the higher revenues come with higher associated cost of
sales. In addition to this, continued growth in the fibre base saw a higher cost of sales charge. This was partially
offset by BTOR cost of sales savings as a result of the lower customer base.

**_Headline gross profit_**

For the reasons set forth above, our headline gross profit for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was
£469 million, compared with £487 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of 3.7%. The
gross profit margin decline from 53.4% to 52.0% reflects a number of effects including: the greater weight of low
margin carrier revenues in the mix (8.0% in the six months ended September 30, 2015 compared with 6.0% in
the six months ended September 30, 2016); the lower weight of retail revenues versus wholesale revenues in the
on-net mix; and lower year-on-year voice usage, partly offset by the growth in high margin data revenue (8.3%
of total revenues in the six months ended September 30, 2015 compared with 5.9% in the six months ended
September 30, 2016) and the benefits of MTTS.

**_Headline operating expenses excluding amortisation and depreciation_**

Our headline operating expenses excluding amortisation and depreciation for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 were £339 million, compared with £397 million for the six months ended September 30,
2015, a decrease of 14.6%.

The following table presents our headline operating expenses excluding amortisation and depreciation for
the six months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016:

_Headline operating expenses_

Headline operating expenses for the six months ended September 30, 2016 remained flat at £245 million,
compared with £245 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, with network and IT investment
(which has driven improved peak time throughput and much improved latencies), mainly offset by MTTS
benefits (from contact centre and retention efficiencies and property costs) and reduced BT regulated backhaul
costs.

_Headline SAC and marketing_

Headline SAC and marketing for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was £94 million, compared with
£152 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of 38.2%. This decrease was primarily

56


-----

due to the reduced volume of Retail connections (driving just over half of the year-on-year reduction); reduced
channel costs (just under a third of the year-on-year reduction) from an extended sales and distribution agreement
with Dixons Carphone PLC and the phasing of certain marketing costs into the second half of the year ending
March 31, 2017. This was partially offset by higher SAC from the growth in data connections by our B2B
customers.

**_Headline EBITDA_**

For the reasons set forth above, our headline EBITDA for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was
£130 million, compared with headline EBITDA of £90 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an
increase of 44.4%.

**_Headline depreciation and amortisation_**

Our headline depreciation and amortisation charges for the six months ended September 30, 2016 were
£65 million, compared with £59 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 10.2%.
This increase was primarily due to prior year capitalisation of intangibles in relation to MTTS, innovation and
our network, as we brought forward some programmes as a result of the 2015 Cyber Attack, for example the
re-platforming of our online channels.

The following table shows the breakdown of headline depreciation and amortisation charges for the six
months ended September 30, 2015 and 2016:

Headline depreciation of property, plant and equipment for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was
£35 million, compared with £36 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of 2.8%.

_Headline amortisation of other operating intangible fixed assets_

Headline amortisation for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was £30 million, compared with
£23 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 30.4%.

**_Headline share of results of joint ventures_**

Headline share of results of joint ventures for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was a loss of
£5 million, compared with a loss of £6 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, a decrease of
16.7%.

**_Headline operating profit_**

For the reasons set forth above, our headline operating profit for the six months ended September 30, 2016
was £60 million, compared with £25 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of
140.0%.

**_Headline net finance costs_**

Headline net finance costs for the six months ended September 30, 2016 were £14 million, compared with
£11 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 27.3%. This increase was primarily due
to the application of a higher blended interest rate of 3.01%, as compared to a blended interest rate of 2.95% for
the six months ended September 30, 2015, to a higher level of average debt and additional fees incurred on the
extension of certain debt facilities including the Receivables Purchase Agreement Facility.

**_Headline profit before taxation_**

For the reasons set forth above, our headline profit before taxation for the six months ended September 30,
2016 was £46 million, compared with a £14 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of
228.6%.

**_Headline taxation_**

For the six months ended September 30, 2016 we recognised a tax charge of £11 million, compared with
£3 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 266.7%.

The effective headline tax rate in the six months ended September 30, 2016 was 24.0% on headline profit
before taxation of £46 million, compared with an effective headline tax rate of 20.0% on headline profit before
taxation of £14 million for the six months ended September 30, 2015. For the six months ended September 30,
2016, the impact of exceptional items resulted in a statutory tax charge of £9 million, compared with a tax credit
of £1 million in the six months ended September 30, 2015. The effective rate of tax has increased from the prior
year due to a reduction in the future statutory tax rate applied to deferred tax assets from 18.0% to 17.0%.

**_Headline profit for the period attributable to the owners of the Company_**

For the reasons set forth above, our headline profit for the period attributable to the owners of the Company
for the six months ended September 30, 2016 was £35 million, compared with £11 million for the six months
ended September 30, 2015, an increase of 218.2%.

**_Headline revenue_**

Our headline revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016 was £1,838 million, compared with £1,795 million
for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 2.4%, which in turn was an increase of 3.9% from
£1,727 million for the year ended March 31, 2014.

_Headline on-net revenue_

Headline on-net revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016 was £1,399 million, compared with
£1,333 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 5.0%. This increase was primarily driven by a
growth in ARPU, as a result of an increase in the pricing of our products and additional RGUs per household, as
compared to the year ended March 31, 2015. Whilst our on-net customer base decreased by 4.3% from
4,177 thousand as at March 31, 2015 to 3,996 thousand as at March 31, 2016, our on-net ARPU increased by
5.8% from £26.97 for the year ended March 31, 2015 to £28.53 for the year ended March 31, 2016. This increase
was partially offset by lower voice usage, lower promotional activity and the mix impact of growing our lower
ARPU wholesale base at a faster rate than our retail base. In addition to this, our retail revenues for the year
ended March 31, 2016 were negatively affected by the 2015 Cyber Attack, which resulted in a spike in churn and
an extended period over which we were unable to trade from our online channels.

Headline on-net revenue for the year ended March 31, 2015 was £1,333 million, compared with
£1,259 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, an increase of 5.9%. This increase was primarily driven by a
growth in our customer base due to our focus on revenue diversification and building a scalable quad play
solution and an increase in the pricing of our products, as compared to the year ended March 31, 2014. Our
on-net customer base increased by 2.9% from 4,060 thousand as at March 31, 2014 to 4,177 thousand as at
March 31, 2015. This increase was partially offset by lower voice usage, the mix impact of growing our lower
ARPU wholesale base at a faster rate than our retail base and lower promotional investment.

_Headline off-net revenue_

Headline off-net revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016 was £55 million, compared with £87 million
for the year ended March 31, 2015, a decrease of 36.8%. This decrease was principally due to the sale of our
consumer off-net broadband subscriber base to Fleur on December 24, 2014.

Headline off-net revenue for the year ended March 31, 2015 was £87 million, compared with £128 million
for the year ended March 31, 2014, a decrease of 32.0%. This decrease was mainly the result of the continued
decline in our voice-only and off-net broadband customer bases, as we focus on growing our on-net customer
base.

**Total headline corporate revenue . . . . . . . . .** **340** **375** **384** **10.3%** **2.4%**

Headline corporate revenue for the year ended March 31, 2016 was £384 million, compared with
£375 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 2.4%. This increase was driven by strong growth
of data revenues by 23.7%, to £120 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 from £97 million for the year
ended March 31, 2015, mainly due to 8,900 net additions to our data (Ethernet and EFM) customer base in the
year ended March 31, 2016. Carrier revenues grew by 13.3%, to £119 million for the year ended March 31, 2016
from £105 million for the year ended March 31, 2015. The growth in data and carrier revenues helped offset the
ongoing decline in legacy voice revenues, which declined by 16.2%, to £145 million for the year ended
March 31, 2016 from £173 million for the year ended March 31, 2015.

-----

Headline corporate revenue for the year ended March 31, 2015 was £375 million, compared with
£340 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, an increase of 10.3%. This increase was driven by strong
growth of data revenues by 38.6%, to £97 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 from £70 million for the
year ended March 31, 2014, mainly due to 8,800 net additions to our data (Ethernet and EFM) customer base in
the year ended March 31, 2015. Carrier revenues also delivered a strong growth of 34.6%, to £105 million for the
year ended March 31, 2015 from £78 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, primarily due to higher usage of
118 numbers. The growth in data and carrier revenues helped offset the decline in legacy voice revenues by
9.9%, to £173 million for the year ended March 31, 2015 from £192 million for the year ended March 31, 2014,
driven by a move from premium rate numbers and the decrease in regulated call termination rates.

**_Headline cost of sales_**

Headline cost of sales for the year ended March 31, 2016 was £845 million, compared with £815 million for
the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 3.7%. This increase was primarily due to the continued growth in
fibre and mobile bases. In the first half of the year ended March 31, 2016, the impact of higher than expected
mobile data usage drove higher cost of sales. In addition to this, there was an increase in low-margin Carrier
trading, where the higher annual revenues come with higher associated cost of sales. This was offset by BT cost
of sales savings as a result of a lower on-net customer base year on year and significantly lower legacy voice
usage by our B2B customers.

Headline cost of sales for the year ended March 31, 2015 was £815 million, compared with £769 million for
the year ended March 31, 2014, an increase of 6.0%. This increase was primarily due to an increase in
low-margin Carrier trading, where the higher annual revenues come with higher associated cost of sales. In
addition to this, a TV content deal drove higher TV cost of sales, whilst continued growth in the fibre and mobile
bases saw a higher cost of sales charge year on year. Increased connections year on year also drove higher
connection cost of sales. This was offset by lower boosts and usage by our Retail customers, along with lower
legacy voice usage by our B2B customers.

**_Headline gross profit_**

Our headline gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2016 was £993 million, compared with a gross profit of
£980 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 1.3%. The movement in gross profit margin from
54.6% to 54.0% during the year reflects a number of effects: pricing activity and high margin data revenue growth,
together with benefits of approximately £5 million from the disconnection of non-paying customers and benefits of
approximately £2 million from MTTS, which were offset by the impact of higher than expected mobile data usage
from our unlimited SIM promotion in the first half of the year ended March 31, 2016, continued reduction in voice
revenues, and an adverse mix effect from the growth in TTB relative to that in the consumer business.

Our headline gross profit for the year ended March 31, 2015 was £980 million, compared with a gross profit
of £958 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, an increase of 2.3%. This was mainly due to customer
growth and the impact of price changes. This was partly offset by a change in the mix from the continued
reduction in voice revenues, growth in fibre and TV content and increased scale of our B2B Wholesale business.

**_Headline operating expenses excluding amortisation and depreciation_**

Our headline operating expenses excluding amortisation and depreciation for the year ended March 31, 2016
were £733 million, compared with £735 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, a decrease of 0.3%, which in
turn was a decrease of 1.3% from £745 million for the year ended March 31, 2014.

_Headline operating expenses_

Headline operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2016 were £473 million, compared with
£426 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 11.0%. The total increase in operating expenses
of £47 million reflects our ongoing investments in innovation programmes, specifically in mobile innovation,
FTTP and Blinkbox, for which we incurred operating expenses of £13 million, operating expenses incurred for
infrastructure, network and IT of £15 million and transformation costs of £31 million, which include our MTTS
programme, property related costs and management overhead costs, offset by £12 million of benefits from
MTTS.

Headline operating expenses for the year ended March 31, 2015 were £426 million, compared with
£427 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, a decrease of 0.2%. This slight decrease was driven by
£17 million of benefits from MTTS in the year ended March 31, 2015, in the form of greater efficiency through
our systems and supply chain, including procurement savings and supplier rebates. These benefits were partially
offset by costs from scaling our business, including customer service, network capacity and resilience, as well as
investments in innovation projects and incremental TV operating costs from the Blinkbox acquisition.

_Headline SAC and marketing_

Headline SAC and marketing for the year ended March 31, 2016 was £260 million, compared with
£309 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, a decrease of 15.9%. The key drivers of the overall reduction in
SAC were: reduced volumes in broadband and TV, lower costs per add in fibre from the significant step-up in
self-installation, a less SAC intensive mix in mobile and a much improved distribution channel mix. Our focus
on existing customers and the benefits of MTTS helped to reduce churn in the second half of the year ended
March 31, 2016 and enabled us to maintain a stable broadband base with fewer gross additions. This, together
with the impact of more efficient distribution channels on costs per add, delivered a £31 million reduction in
SAC as compared to the previous year. In addition, we refocused marketing spend, which resulted in a £6 million
reduction of marketing costs and saw a one-off reduction of £8 million as a result of the disruption caused by the
2015 Cyber Attack.

Headline SAC and marketing for the year ended March 31, 2015 was £309 million, compared with
£318 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, a decrease of 2.8%. This reduction was mainly driven by
reduced costs of acquiring broadband and TV customers due to an increased proportion of customers who selfinstall their broadband and fibre products, and improving the channel mix to lower cost online channels. Churn
rate decreased from 1.6% for the year ended March 31, 2014 to 1.4% for the year ended March 31, 2015,
supported by improved customer service and the increased penetration of TV, mobile and fibre products in our
customer base. These efficiency savings were partly reinvested in driving higher mobile and fibre growth as part
of our broader trading strategy.

**_Headline EBITDA_**

For the reasons set forth above, our headline EBITDA for the year ended March 31, 2016 was £260 million,
compared with of £245 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 6.1%, which in turn was an
increase of 15.0% from £213 million for the year ended March 31, 2014.

**_Headline depreciation and amortisation_**

Our headline depreciation and amortisation charges for the year ended March 31, 2016 were £121 million,
compared with £120 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 0.8%, which in turn was an
increase of 7.1% from £112 million for the year ended March 31, 2014.

the year ended March 31, 2014, an increase of 20.0%.

**_Headline share of results of joint ventures_**

Headline share of results of joint ventures for the year ended March 31, 2016 remained flat at a loss of
£8 million, compared with the year ended March 31, 2015.

Headline share of results of joint ventures for the year ended March 31, 2015 amounted to a loss of
£8 million, compared with a loss of £7 million for the year ended March 31, 2014, an increase of 14.3%. This
increase was primarily due to a higher share of losses allocated to us from the YouView TV Limited joint
venture.

**_Headline operating profit_**

For the reasons set forth above, our headline operating profit for the year ended March 31, 2016 was
£131 million, compared with £117 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 12.0%, which in
turn was an increase of 24.4% from £94 million for the year ended March 31, 2014.

**_Headline net finance costs_**

Headline net finance costs for the year ended March 31, 2016 were £24 million, compared with £22 million
for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 9.1%. This increase was primarily due to a slightly higher
blended interest rate of 3.07%, compared with a blended interest rate of 3.00% for the year ended March 31,
2015, on higher levels of average net debt.

Headline net finance costs for the year ended March 31, 2015 were £22 million, compared with £20 million
for the year ended March 31, 2014, an increase of 10.0%. This increase was primarily due to higher interest
payments as a result of higher net debt, partially offset by a lower blended interest rate of 3.00%, compared with
3.39% for the year ended March 31, 2014, due to better refinancing terms.

**_Headline profit before taxation_**

For the reasons set forth above, our headline profit before taxation for the year ended March 31, 2016 was
£107 million, compared with £95 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 12.6%, which in turn
was an increase of 28.4% from £74 million for the year ended March 31, 2014.

**_Headline taxation_**

For the year ended March 31, 2016 we recognised a headline tax charge of £28 million, compared with
£19 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an increase of 47.3%. For the year ended March 31, 2015 we
recognised a headline tax charge of £19 million, compared with £13 million for the year ended March 31, 2014,
an increase of 46.2%.

The effective headline tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2016 was 26.0%, representing a tax charge of
£28 million, compared with an effective headline tax rate of 20.0%, representing a tax charge of £19 million, for
the year ended March 31, 2015. The increased tax rate was due to the impact on the deferred tax asset of a
reduction in the UK statutory corporation tax rate from 20.0% to 17.0% over the period from April 1, 2017 to
April 1, 2020. In addition, a £2 million tax charge has been recognised in exceptional items, reflecting the impact
of the same rate change on the deferred tax asset recognised through exceptional items in the year ended
March 31, 2015.

The effective headline tax rate for the year ended March 31, 2015 was 20.0%, representing a tax charge of
£19 million, compared with an effective headline tax rate of 18.0%, representing a tax charge of £13 million, for
the year ended March 31, 2014. This was broadly in line with the statutory tax rate of 21.0%. We recognised tax
credits of £40 million in the year ended March 31, 2015, including two exceptional tax credits comprising
(i) £29 million in respect of losses acquired in the acquisition of VNL, as the now well established TV business
enabled us to recognise losses over a longer time period and (ii) £16 million for the resolution of legacy items.

In the year ended March 31, 2014, we recognised tax credits of £nil.

**_Headline profit for the period attributable to the owners of the Company_**

For the reasons set forth above, our headline profit attributable to the owners of the Company for the year
ended March 31, 2016 was £79 million, compared with £76 million for the year ended March 31, 2015, an
increase of 3.9%, which in turn was an increase of 24.6% from £61 million for the year ended March 31, 2014.

**LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES**

Historically, our principal sources of liquidity have been our operating cash flows as well as a combination
of bank facilities, the USPP Notes, retained profits and equity. Our liquidity needs consist of funding operating
expenses, changes in working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements and other liquidity
requirements that may arise from time to time, including, without limitation: (i) refinancing of outstanding debt,
(ii) acquisitions and other investment opportunities, and (iii) payments in the ordinary course of business.

As at September 30, 2016, we had £162 million and £96 million of undrawn committed and uncommitted
borrowing facilities, respectively. We believe that, following the issuance of the Notes, our operating cash flows,
borrowing capacity under existing credit facilities and the proceeds of the Notes offered hereby will be sufficient
to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity requirements and commitments. Our actual financing requirements
will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. See “Risk Factors—Risks Relating
_To Our Financial Position—We require a significant amount of cash to service our debt and sustain our_
_operations. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control, and we may not be able to_
_generate sufficient cash to service our debt” and “Description of Other Indebtedness.”_

We had a working capital requirement of £69 million in the six months ended September 30, 2016. This was
due to an increase in trade and other receivables of £40 million, a decrease in trade and other payables of
£46 million and a decrease in provisions of £8 million. The increase in trade and other receivables was mainly
due to the timing of payments in relation to the extended distribution agreement with Dixons Carphone plc and
increased prepayments including for marketing spend ahead of the launch of fixed low price plans. The decrease
in trade and other payables was mainly due to the phasing of stock payments.

The decrease in provisions was mainly due to the partial unwinding of prior year provisions related to the
2015 Cyber Attack. These effects were partially offset by a decrease in inventory of £25 million. We expect to
see an improvement in working capital in the second half of the year ending March 31, 2017, as most of the first
half outflows reverse.

We had a working capital surplus of £11 million in the six months ended September 30, 2015. This was due
to a decrease in trade and other receivables of £18 million and an increase in trade and other payables of
£15 million. This was partially offset by an increase in inventory of £6 million and an increase in provisions of
£16 million.

We had a working capital surplus of £nil in the year ended March 31, 2016. This was due to a decrease in
trade and other receivables of £15 million and an increase in trade and other payables of £17 million. These
effects were fully offset by an increase in inventory of £26 million and a decrease in provisions of £6 million.

We had a working capital surplus of £1 million in the year ended March 31, 2015. This was due to an
increase in trade and other payables of £26 million and an increase of provisions of £26 million. This was largely
offset by an increase in trade and other receivables of £44 million and an increase in inventory of £7 million.

We had a working capital requirement of £35 million in the year ended March 31, 2014. This was due to an
increase in trade and other receivables, inventory and provisions of £36 million, £1 million and £5 million,
respectively.

**_Net cash flows generated from operating activities_**

Net cash flows generated from operating activities were £57 million in the six months ended September 30,
2016 and £87 million in the six months ended September 30, 2015. The amount for the six months ended
September 30, 2016 includes a tax refund of £3 million in respect of income tax paid in the year ended March 31,
2015. The decrease in net cash flows generated from operating activities in the six months ended September 30,
2015 was primarily due to changes in working capital discussed above.

Net cash flows generated from operating activities were £182 million in the year ended March 31, 2016 and
£194 million in the year ended March 31, 2015. The amount for the year ended March 31, 2015 includes a
deduction for income taxes paid of £2 million, while there was no deduction for income taxes paid in the year
ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in net cash flows generated from operating activities in the year ended
March 31, 2016, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2015 was primarily due to movements in working
capital discussed above.

Net cash flows generated from operating activities were £194 million in the year ended March 31, 2015 and
£160 million in the year ended March 31, 2014. The amount for the year ended March 31, 2015 includes a
deduction for income taxes paid of £2 million, while there was no deduction for income taxes paid in the year
ended March 31, 2014. The increase in net cash flows generated from operating activities in the year ended
March 31, 2015, as compared with the year ended March 31, 2014 was primarily due to movements in working
capital discussed above.

**_Cash flows used in investing activities_**

Cash flows used in investing activities were £105 million in the six months ended September 30, 2016,
£96 million in the six months ended September 30, 2015, £178 million in the year ended March 31, 2016,
£150 million in the year ended March 31, 2015 and £115 million in the year ended March 31, 2014.

During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we invested £6 million in subsidiaries and joint ventures,
which represents investments mainly relating to the YouView joint venture. Investments in intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment were £99 million, which included the impact of a delay in delivering certain
elements of quarter four 2016 expenditure into the first half of 2017, which has driven a first half weighting to
capital expenditure. Other capital expenditure during the period related to our ongoing investment in MTTS, the
development of our new mobile CRM and billing platform, together with core systems and network investment.

During the six months ended September 30, 2015, we invested £5 million in subsidiaries and joint ventures,
which represents the initial consideration for tIPicall Limited, a company providing VoIP services. Investments
in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment were £91 million, of which £18 million relates to MTTS,
£15 million to the development of our new mobile billing platform and the balance to the development of our
core systems and network.

During the year ended March 31, 2016, we invested £14 million in subsidiaries and joint ventures, mainly
representing £8 million of expenditure in respect of the YouView joint venture, £1 million in respect of the York
FTTP joint venture and £5 million in respect of the initial consideration for tIPicall Limited. We received
£2 million in relation to the disposal of our off-net broadband customer base. Investments in intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment were £166 million, and was higher than our long run average of 6%-7% of
revenues as a result of the phasing of our investment in innovation projects and some pulling forward of MTTS
investment as a result of the 2015 Cyber Attack. This expenditure was focused on meeting the forecast demands
for our network (e.g., higher capacity backhaul circuits), MTTS programmes and innovation (e.g., hardware
equipment for the Ultra Fibre Optic trial in York and the build of our new mobile billing system and associated
functionalities). Disposal of property, plant and equipment was £12 million, which related to the disposal of
network equipment and computer hardware.

During the year ended March 31, 2015, we acquired subsidiaries and joint ventures for £38 million, which
included £8 million of expenditure in respect of the YouView joint venture, £3 million in respect of the York
FTTP joint venture and £27 million in respect of the initial consideration for the acquisition of broadband and
voice customers from both Virgin Media Limited and Tesco Stores Limited and the acquisition of Blinkbox
Entertainment Limited (“Blinkbox”). Blinkbox was one of the leading on-demand providers of pay content in the

66


-----

UK and worked across multiple platforms and devices, both inside and outside the home. Blinkbox’s established
technical expertise in multi-platform, multi-device content delivery and incremental content relationships were
highly complementary to our strategy of being the best value-for-money TV provider in the UK.

Investments in intangible assets and property, plant and equipment was £112 million and was once again
focused on meeting the forecast demands for our network and on driving efficiency through MTTS. Disposal of
property, plant and equipment was £4 million, which related to the disposal of a data centre.

During the year ended March 31, 2014, we acquired subsidiaries and joint ventures for £8 million, which
included £5 million of expenditure in respect of the YouView joint venture and £3 million to complete the
acquisition of Future Office Communications Limited. Investments in intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment were £107 million, where we continued to invest in the network, rolling out to a further 303
exchanges, and increased network capacity to 1.2tb, alongside investing in IT systems to support continued
growth.

outflow of £135 million comprised the payment of dividends to our shareholders.

In the year ended March 31, 2015 we had an outflow of £27 million, which includes outflows of
£116 million for the payment of dividends and £22 million for interest payments, partially offset by inflows of
£109 million from drawings under various facilities and of £2 million relating to the in-year settlement of Group
share schemes.

-----

In the year ended March 31, 2014 we had an outflow of £59 million, which includes outflows of £99 million
for the payment of dividends and £17 million for interest payments. The outflow also includes £39 million
resulting from the vesting of the second tranche of our share scheme, which required us to purchase the
participants’ shares, and share repurchases by the Employee Benefit Trust in anticipation of future exercise of
share options. These outflows were partially offset by inflows from the in-year settlement of Group share
schemes in an amount of £6 million and drawdowns under various facilities of £90 million.

**Planned Cash Requirements and Capital Expenditure Plan**

We anticipate that our cash requirements in the near to medium term will consist principally of expenditures
to upgrade and expand our network, to fund our MTTS programme, to complete the build of mobile billing
systems and to service our debt. The following discussion sets out our principal cash needs based, among other
things, on our existing capital expenditure plan, our outstanding bonds, bank loans and other contractual
commitments.

Beyond our contractually committed capital expenditures, our investment plan for the near to medium term
is largely discretionary. These expenditures could include:

   - continued system development to improve customer experience across retail and wholesale network
expansion to meet customer demand and to drive structural cost savings by deploying next generation
switches and dark fibre;

   - complete build of FTTP across York which involves 40 thousand more homes at a £20 million cost over
18 months from Spring 2017; and

   - building an inside out mobile network, including investments in a thick network and Femto technology
roll-out.

**Contractual obligations**

Our principal contractual obligations consist of obligations in respect of financial indebtedness that is owed
under our outstanding bonds and credit facilities.

The table below sets out the maturities of our financial liabilities, as at September 30, 2016, based on the
agreements in place as at that date. The amounts disclosed in the table below are the contractual undiscounted
gross cash flows assuming year-end interest rates remain constant and that borrowings are paid in full in the year
of maturity. We expect that our contractual commitments may evolve over time in response to current business
and market conditions, with the result that future amounts due may differ considerably from the expected
amounts payable set out in the table below.

On January 6, 2016, the Issuer, as borrower, the Guarantors, as guarantors, and the lenders as described
therein entered into the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility has a total capacity
of £100 million. The final maturity date of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is May 31, 2018.

As at September 30, 2016, we had £50 million outstanding under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility. We
expect to repay all of the drawings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility in full using the proceeds of the
Offering. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**_2014 Bilateral Agreement_**

On July 14, 2014, the Issuer, as borrower, and a lender as described therein entered into the 2014 Bilateral
Agreement. The final maturity date of the drawings under the 2014 Bilateral Agreement is July 14, 2019. As at
September 30, 2016, we had £50 million outstanding under the 2014 Bilateral Agreement.

**_Term Loan Facility_**

On July 14, 2014, the Issuer, as borrower, the Guarantors, as guarantors, and a lender as described therein
entered into the £100 million Term Loan Facility. Out of £100 million, £50 million mature on May 31, 2018 and
£50 million mature on July 14, 2019.

As at September 30, 2016, we had £100 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility. We expect to
repay £50 million of drawings under the Term Loan Facility using the proceeds of the Offering. Following the
completion of the Refinancing, the amount outstanding under the Term Loan Facility is expected to be
£50 million. See “Use of Proceeds.”

**_USPP Notes_**

On July 17, 2014, the Issuer issued $185 million aggregate principal amount senior notes, consisting of
(i) $139 million aggregate principal amount of 4.29% senior notes due July 17, 2021 (ii) $25 million aggregate
principal amount of 4.70% senior notes due July 17, 2024 and (iii) $21 million aggregate principal amount of
4.85% senior notes due July 17, 2026. The USPP Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors on an unsecured basis.

As at September 30, 2016, we had £142 million outstanding under the USPP Notes, net of derivatives (cash
flow hedges) of £33 million.

**_Receivables Purchase Agreement Facility_**

On September 16, 2016, the Issuer entered into the Receivables Purchase Agreement Facility which
contains a £75 million loan facility, expiring in September 2018. Under this agreement, we have the ability on a
rolling basis to sell our receivables in exchange for a discounted consideration. We continue to consolidate the
relevant receivables on the grounds that not substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of such
receivables have been transferred under the programme.

As at September 30, 2016, we had £63 million outstanding under the Receivables Purchase Agreement
Facility.

**_Bank overdrafts_**

We use bank overdraft facilities to assist in short term cash management; these uncommitted facilities bear
interest at a margin over the Bank of England base rate. As at September 30, 2016, we had £15 million in bank
overdrafts outstanding.

**_Financial leasing agreements_**

As at September 30, 2016, we had no material financial leasing agreements in place.

69


-----

**Pension obligations**

We provide various defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of a significant number of its
employees. For the year ended March 31, 2016, we incurred pension costs of £4 million for our employees
(including our Board of Directors and Executive Committee). We do not operate a defined benefit pension
scheme.

**Commitments**

We have in the normal course of business entered into various multi-year supply and working capital
agreements for core network, IT and customer equipment. Expenditure contracted, but not provided for in the
Financial Statements amounted to £264 million, £318 million, £450 million and £32 million for the six months
ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Of this amount,
£52 million, £55 million, £85 million and £23 million, for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and the year
ended March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to capital commitments and £39 million,
£25 million, £nil million and £nil million, for the six months ended September 30, 2016 and the year ended
March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, related to the supply of customer equipment.

**Contingent obligations**

Apart from the commitments described above and in the section entitled “Risk Factors”, we have no
material contingent obligations.

As at March 31, 2014, we had received £33 million in total in relation to an Ofcom determination that BT
had overcharged us for certain wholesale Ethernet services. During the year ended March 31, 2015, BT lost its
appeal against Ofcom’s determination in the Competition Appeal Tribunal and appealed to the Court of Appeal.
This appeal is due to be heard in the Court of Appeal in March 2017. We consider the appeal unlikely to succeed
based on the advice received and so have not recorded any liability for repayment as at September 30, 2016,
although the outcome of the appeal is not yet certain.

**OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS**

We lease network infrastructure and offices under non-cancellable operating leases.

The table below presents our outstanding commitments for future minimum payments under our operating
leases as at March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and September 30, 2015 and 2016:

Other than the operating leases discussed above and the commitments described under the caption
“—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Financial Obligations,” we do not have any material off-balance sheet
arrangements.

**QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS**

We are exposed to the following risks from the use of financial instruments: credit risk, liquidity risk and
market risk (including currency risk and interest rate risk).

**Credit risk**

Financial assets, which potentially subject us to credit risk, consist principally of trade and other receivables,
non-current investments and investments in joint ventures, derivative financial instruments and cash and cash
equivalents. We regularly monitor our exposure to credit risk. Debt, investments, foreign exchange and
derivative transactions are all spread amongst a number of banks, all of which have short or long term credit
ratings appropriate to our exposures. Trade receivables primarily comprise balances due from fixed-line
customers, and provision is made for any receivables that are considered to be irrecoverable.

Our exposure to credit risk as at March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 as well as September 30, 2016 was

**Liquidity risk**

We manage our exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the long and short term cash flow
projections for the business against facilities and other resources available to us. Headroom is assessed based on
historical experience as well as by assessing current business risks, including foreign exchange movements. Our
existing bank debt facilities do not expire until May 2018 and July 2019, the USPP Notes mature in three
tranches in July 2021, 2024 and 2026.

71


-----

It is our policy to refinance debt maturities significantly ahead of maturity dates.

**Currency risk**

We utilise spot and forward foreign exchange trading to hedge transactional exposures, which arise mainly
through cost of sales and operating expenses and are primarily denominated in euro and U.S. dollar. We also use
cross-currency swaps to hedge our U.S. dollar denominated borrowings (USPP Notes). As at September 30,
2016, the adjustment to translate our net debt to sterling at swap rates to reflect the impact of hedging was
£33 million, compared with £20 million, £16 million and £nil as at March 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Our exposure to foreign currency risk as at March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016, as well as at September 30,
2016 was as follows:

(2) Represents amounts to be received as part of the cross currency interest swaps in place at the end of each period. See “—Derivative
_Financial Instruments.”_

**Interest rate risk**

Our interest rates risks arise primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at
floating rates of interest and thus expose us to cash flow interest rate risk. These floating rates are linked to
LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency. Future cash flows arising from
these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods for each loan or rollover. As detailed under
“—Derivative Financial Instruments”, we have cash flow hedges in place to mitigate our interest rate risk on our
borrowings.

As at March 31, 2014, 2015 and 2016 and September 30, 2016, the interest rate profile of our interestbearing financial instruments was:

**Capital risk management**

We manage our capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while
maximising the return to stakeholders.

Our capital structure of consists of debt, which includes the borrowings, cash and cash equivalents and
equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings. We
review the capital structure on an annual basis including reviewing opportunities to access other sources of
finance including the public debt markets.

We use the external ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA to monitor our capital structure and has a
medium-term ratio target of 2.0x. In the short term, this ratio will be temporarily exceeded as we execute our
business strategy.

**DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS**

As at September 30, 2016 we had both derivative financial liabilities and derivative financial assets. As at
September 30, 2016 we had no embedded derivatives.

As at September 30, 2016 we had cash flow hedges in place to (i) swap the interest rate risk on the 2014
Revolving Credit Facility from floating to fixed and (ii) swap the currency and interest rate risk on the USPP
Notes from USD to GBP and from fixed US Treasury interest rates to fixed GBP interest rates. The fair value of
these instruments as at September 30, 2016 was £33 million. As the hedges were fully effective there has been no
income statement impact.

**ACCOUNTING POLICIES REQUIRING MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION**

We prepare our financial statements in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the EU. Certain financial
reporting standards under IFRS require us to make judgments or to use our discretion in determining the values
to be recorded, as described in the notes to our Annual Financial Statements included elsewhere in this offering
memorandum. The most material of these include the following:

**Rebates receivable from suppliers**

Occasionally, we enter into agreements with certain suppliers for rebates on the cost of goods purchased.
Judgement is applied by our management in these circumstances to ensure that the rebate is recognised over the
appropriate financial period. Rebates from suppliers in the year related to renegotiated contract rates and
compensation received under existing contracts. Where these amounts relate to historical transactions, negotiated
in the current year, they are recognised in the current year income statement. Where they relate to future
transactions, negotiated in the current year, they are recognised in accordance with the contractual terms.

**Revenue recognition for bundled transactions**

Revenue is stated net of VAT and other sales-related taxes and represents the gross inflow of economic
benefit generated from the provision of fixed-line, TV and mobile telecommunication services. All such revenue
is recognised as the services are provided:

   - line rental is recognised in the period to which it relates;

73


-----

   - voice and broadband subscriptions are recognised in the period to which they relate;

   - usage including voice and TV content is recognised in the period in which the customer takes the service;

   - promotional discounts and credits are amortised on a straight line basis over the minimum contract period
subject to an adjustment for in-contract churn; and

   - data service solutions and other service contracts are recognised as we fulfil our performance obligations.

Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. When we sell a number of
products within a bundled transaction, the total consideration from the arrangement is allocated to each element
based on their relative fair values. We apply judgement in determining the amount of revenue we recognise for
delivered elements. This is limited to the amounts billed for that element.

**Taxation**

Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or
recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the
balance sheet and its tax base.

Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, and
the carry-forward of unused tax losses and credits. Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be
available against which the asset can be utilised. Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement
except where it relates to an item recognised directly in reserves, in which case it is recognised directly in
reserves. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant
jurisdictions.

The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to which taxable profits are generated in
the relevant jurisdictions for the foreseeable future, and on the tax legislation then in force, and as such the value
of associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.

**Exceptional items**

Headline results are stated before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items.
Exceptional items are those that are considered to be one-off or non-recurring in nature and so material that we
believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid distortion of the presentation of underlying performance and
should be separately presented on the face of the income statement.

The classification of items as exceptional is subjective in nature and therefore judgement is required to
determine whether the item is in line with the accounting policy criteria outlined above. Determining whether an
item is exceptional is a matter of qualitative assessment, making it distinct from our other critical accounting
judgements where the basis for judgement is estimation.

**Impairment of goodwill**

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing the excess of the
fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is
recognised initially as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses. On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit
or loss on disposal.

We have two cash generating units (“CGU”)—TalkTalk Consumer and TTB. For the purpose of
impairment testing, at the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from
the synergies of the acquisition. Our shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central
overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows that those shared costs
support.

74


-----

Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the
CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates to use to calculate present values.

Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an
indication that the asset may be impaired; this review is performed at a CGU level. Impairment is determined by
assessing the future cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill relates. Our future cash flows are taken from
the five year plan approved by our management and extrapolated out to 20 years based on the UK’s long term
growth rate. This is discounted by the CGU’s weighted average cost of capital pre-tax to give the net present
value of that CGU. Where the net present value of future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the unit, the
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to
the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any
impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.

**Valuation of intangibles**

**_Operating intangibles_**

Operating intangibles include internal infrastructure and design costs incurred in the development of
software for internal use. Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be
separately identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, and the development
cost can be measured reliably. Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an
expense in the year in which it is incurred. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised include employee costs
specifically incurred in the development of the intangible asset. Operating intangibles are amortised on a straight
line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to eight years.

**_Acquisition intangibles_**

Acquired intangible assets such as customer bases and other intangible assets acquired through a business
combination are capitalized separately from goodwill and amortised over their expected useful lives of up to six
years on a straight line basis. The value attributed to such assets is based on the future economic benefit that is
expected to be derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash flows after a deduction for
contributory assets.

**_Impairment_**

At the acquisition date, acquisition intangibles are allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from
the synergies of the combination. Our shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central
overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows.

Determining whether the carrying amounts of operating and acquisition intangibles have any indication of
impairment requires judgement. If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to
assess whether the carrying amounts can be supported by the value in use of the CGU that the asset is allocated
to.

The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection
of appropriate discount rates to use to calculate present values.

The assessment of the useful economic lives of these operating and acquisition intangibles requires
judgement. Amortisation is charged to the income statement based on the useful economic life selected. This
assessment requires estimation of the period over which we will benefit from the assets.

**Impairment of assets**

We review the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that
those assets have suffered an impairment loss at each reporting date. Where an indicator of impairment exists, we
make a formal estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount and the extent of any impairment loss.

The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In
assessing value in use, the estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate
that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for
which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount
of the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.

**INDUSTRY OVERVIEW**

The UK telecommunication market comprises fixed-line, mobile and pay TV services. This is Europe’s
largest (and the world’s fifth largest) telecommunication services market, in terms of annual revenue (Source:
Ofcom; International Communications Market Report 2015). It generated £37.5 billion in revenues in 2015,
which represented a 0.5% increase compared with 2014, mainly due to an increase in retail fixed revenues
(driven by increased take-up of superfast broadband), which was partially offset by a fall in wholesale service
revenue (driven by falling mobile call termination rates). Over the last five years UK telecommunication services
retail revenues as reported by Ofcom have increased, and 2015 revenues were £1.2 billion, or 3.2%, higher than
in 2010, primarily resulting from growth in fixed-line revenues (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market
Report (August 2016)).

**UK FIXED-LINE TELECOMMUNICATIONS: A STRUCTURALLY ATTRACTIVE MARKET**

Fixed-line telecommunication services consist of fixed data (mainly broadband internet) and voice services
offered over copper and cable networks. Fibre services for domestic premises (superfast broadband) are offered
predominantly through FTTC which relies upon copper for the last mile of delivery. Fibre services for business
applications are offered via Ethernet connectivity. Cable is available across approximately 55% of the UK,
although not in uniformly contiguous geographies, reflecting historically diverse build patterns.

The UK fixed-line market is a competitive, but structurally attractive market with a number of
distinguishing features.

**Significant investment required to develop a scale network**

Building a new national fixed-line network would require a sizeable investment, in terms of time and
money. Significant capital expenditure would be needed due to the large physical build requirements. In addition,
any such development today would be extremely technologically challenging given, among other things, physical
constraints in BTOR’s exchanges where unbundling network equipment is housed and BTOR’s capacity to
deliver connections in those exchanges. Of the four fixed-line operators in the UK, Sky and the Group have built
their networks over the last decade, through unbundled architecture deployed across BT’s national exchange
footprint. However, when the Group and Sky entered the market, broadband was a far less established product.

**Growing demand for bandwidth**

The industry has been experiencing strong and sustained demand for better fixed-line connectivity from
households and businesses, which is expected to continue. In particular, while the total number of households in
the UK is expected to remain flat at approximately 27 million through 2021, the number of households
subscribed to fixed-line telephony, broadband internet and pay TV services is expected to increase at a CAGR of
1.0%, 1.3% and 2.4%, respectively, from 2016 to 2021 (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market 20122016; ONS). At the same time, data usage in the UK is growing exponentially, driven by device proliferation and
video so that mobile users are expected to increase their data traffic from 0.96GB/month in 2015 to 5.6GB/month
in 2020, while households are expected to increase their fixed-line traffic from 84.5GB/month in 2015 to
202.1GB/month in 2020 (Source: Cisco). As a result, demand for telecommunication services is set to remain
high and continue to grow.

**Poor substitutes**

At present, the only technological substitute for fixed-line connectivity is wireless data and voice traffic
through a mobile network. However, data transportation via a mobile network is significantly more expensive,
radio spectrum availability is constrained and finite and there is no evidence that such technological and
economic impediments could easily be overcome in the near future. This differential in economics, coupled with
providers increasingly offering bundled triple and quad play products to increase wallet share and loyalty, is
driving convergence between fixed and mobile providers (such as the recent acquisition by BT of EE).

**Supplier power constrained by strong regulation**

There is a clear history of pro-competition regulation in the UK telecommunication industry over the last
decade. Such regulation has been targeted at curtailing the powers of BT as the incumbent provider and has
promoted development of retail competitors on a national scale. Ofcom will continue to regulate strongly BT’s
dominant market position to ensure access to BTOR’s core infrastructure on fair terms. In keeping with this
remit, Ofcom has recently confirmed its intention to seek a legal separation of BTOR from BT Group, which will
underpin another boost to pro-competition regulation for the benefit of non-incumbent operators.

-----

Therefore, whilst the market for fixed-line telecommunication services in the UK is promotionally intense, it
remains fundamentally rational in terms of price setting, allowing for inflationary price increases. Such rational
customer approach, premium positioning of the three largest operators (BT, Sky and Virgin Media) and structural
features of the market (significant investment required to enter the market, the absence of affordable substitutes,
exponential demand for bandwidth and strong regulation of the incumbent supplier) underpin the large
opportunity in the market for a value-for-money operator, such as the Group.

**FIXED-LINE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES**

**Fixed Broadband**

UK internet revenues from residential and SME users (non-corporate) were £5.1 billion in 2015, virtually all
of which came from broadband services. It is estimated that 86% of UK’s adult population had access to the
internet at their homes in 2016 (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market Report (August 2016)).

There are four main internet services providers in the UK: BT, Sky, Virgin Media and the Group. BT is the
country’s largest provider of fixed broadband services to residential and SME customers. In 2015 BT’s market
share was 32% (excluding EE), followed by Sky with 23%, Virgin Media with 19%, the Group with 13%, and
EE with 4%. Other providers made up 8% of the market (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market Report
(August 2016)).

The UK fixed broadband market has shown steady growth historically, increasing from 19.6 million lines in
2010 to 24.7 million lines in 2015 at a CAGR of 4.7%. Of these 24.7 million fixed broadband lines at the end of
2015, 5.9 million, or 24%, were non-LLU ADSL, 8.6 million, or 35%, were LLU ADSL, 4.7 million, or 19%,
were cable and 5.4 million, or 22%, were fibre (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market Report (August
2016)).

In 2015, the number of fibre-based lines grew by 1.8 million, or 50%, and the number of cable-based lines
has continued to grow steadily (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market Report (August 2016)). Demand
for greater bandwidth, driven by growth in video streaming and online gaming, saw the number of superfast
broadband connections, i.e. those providing actual speeds of at least 30Mbps, increase by 2.0 million, or 24%,
during 2015 (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market Report (August 2016)).

UK revenues from corporate data services were £2.6 billion in 2015, and represent revenues from web
hosting, Ethernet/digital leased line services, IP-VPN services and, to a far lesser extent, revenues from frame/
cell services. These revenues have been relatively stable, and despite declining at a CAGR of 1% over the five
years from 2010, increased by 0.1% year-on-year in 2015 (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market Report
(August 2016)). In addition, volumes of Ethernet connections are growing, with Ovum forecasting a growth in
service end points at a CAGR of 11% between 2013 and 2020 (Source: Ovum).

**Fixed-line Telephony**

In 2015, fixed-line access and call revenues in the UK were £8.4 billion, generated across 33.2 million fixed
lines. The majority of these revenues came from line rental and bundled calls (Source: Ofcom; The
Communications Market Report (August 2016)). The four main residential landline providers in the UK are BT,
Sky, Virgin Media and the Group.

Fixed-line telephony volumes continue to be impacted by substitution towards text-based forms of
communication and mobile calls. Over the past five years, the total volume of voice calls has fallen by 37 billion
minutes, or 15%, and during the same period, fixed voice volumes have fallen by 49 billion minutes, or 40%.
Despite this decline in fixed-line telephony volumes, the number of fixed lines has remained relatively stable
over the past five years, as consumers require these for internet connections (Source: Ofcom; The
Communications Market Report (August 2016)).

In 2015, total fixed voice call volumes in the UK fell by 7.0 billion minutes, or 9%, to 74 billion minutes.
This year-on-year decline was broadly representative of the five-year decline at a CAGR of 10% (Source:
Ofcom; The Communications Market Report (August 2016)).

Compared with the trend in call volumes, total revenue from fixed lines and average revenue per fixed line
have both fallen at a CAGR of 2% over the past five years. In 2015 this decrease further slowed down to a
CAGR of 0.1%. Revenues have been supported by price increases from the major providers, particularly in line
rental, where average revenues have increased over the last five years by £2.48 to £15.03 per month, which
represented an increase of 20% over five years at a CAGR of 3.7%. For example, the price of BT’s standard line
rental has increased by 35% since 2010 (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market Report (August 2016)).

78


-----

The number of fixed lines (PSTN lines and ISDN channels) in the UK has remained fairly stable over the
past five years. An increase in the number of residential lines offset a decrease in the number of business lines,
which has fallen due to the increased uptake of VoIP calls. The growth in residential lines (1.8 million in the five
years from 2010) has been driven by increased broadband internet penetration, for which most homes require a
fixed voice line, and an increase in the number of households. Ofcom’s data show that 73% of people with a
fixed-line use it for internet access (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market Report (August 2016)).

**MOBILE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES**

In 2015, total mobile revenues in the UK were £15.2 billion, the majority of which came from access and
bundled services. Total revenues have increased slightly over the five years since 2010, with access and bundled
charges steadily growing, but out-of-bundle revenues (calls, messages, and data) falling. There are four main
operators in the UK market: BT (EE) with 29%, Telefónica UK with 27%, Vodafone with 19%, and Three with
11% market shares, in each case, in 2015. MVNOs and resellers, including the Group, make up the remaining
15% of the market (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market Report (August 2016)).

Trends in mobile usage over the five years from 2010 to 2015 show an increase in the total number of call
minutes, in line with the number of subscriptions at a CAGR of 1.7%, but a significant decline in sent messages
at a CAGR of 4.8% driven by increasing use of instant messaging services and emails on smartphones (Source:
Ofcom; The Communications Market Report (August 2016)). Smartphone availability and usage has increased
with the expansion of mobile data services. In the UK, mobile data usage was 67% higher in 2015 than in 2014,
and by the end of 2015, more than 45% of mobile connections were a 4G service (Source: Ofcom; The
Communications Market Report (August 2016)).

In addition, the market has demonstrated a strong growth in SIM-only contracts, driven by phone owners
holding on to their handsets for longer periods. In June 2010, almost four users in ten, or 38%, had owned their
handsets for less than six months, a figure that had declined by ten percentage points by 2015. Over the same
period, the proportion of phone owners that had their device for more than 18 months had increased from 14% to
23% (Source: YouGov Research—SMIX Tracker). This trend has driven growth in demand for SIM-only
contracts, especially those lasting for 12 months: the number of new SIM-only contracts sold in October 2016
grew to over 360,000, a year-on-year increase of 13.5%, with 12 months contract SIMs growing by nearly 20%
(Source: Gfk).

**PAY TV**

The UK TV industry is characterised by a significant Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) sector. This
includes the BBC, which provides content predominantly through a government funded model (license fee), as
well as private sector channels, such as ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5, which operate under an advertisingdriven model. As such, whilst there are just over 11 million pay TV subscribing households in the UK, over 80%
of viewing, whether live or catch-up is of free to air content (Source: Broadcasters’ Audience Research Board).
In recent years, video on demand (VoD) has become increasingly popular in the UK, in terms of both free and
paid-for content.

At the end of 2015, the four main pay TV providers had a total of approximately 17.8 million subscribers,
with Sky being the largest with 11.3 million subscribers. Sky’s TV packages are available on a standalone basis
or when bundled with broadband and fixed line. BT and the Group each had approximately 1.4 million pay TV
subscribers at the end of 2015. Their pay TV offerings are only available when bundled with broadband and fixed
line, and include various options for movies and sports channels (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market
Report (August 2016)). In addition, the UK pay TV market is seeing strong incursions by Over the Top (OTT)
content providers such as Netflix, Amazon Prime and Youtube. The four main providers all offer VoD and
out-of-home viewing options (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market Report (August 2016)).

**TRENDS IN BUNDLING**

In the UK, there has been a trend towards bundling over the last decade, and in 2016, 68% of households
subscribed to bundled services. The vast majority of these were fixed voice and broadband (29% of households)
and fixed voice, broadband and TV (28% of households). The proportion of households subscribing to bundled
services increased significantly from 50% in 2010, and 29% in 2005, driven by the growth in triple play bundled
services (Source: Ofcom; The Communications Market Report (August 2016)). The UK continues to lag other
European countries in the take-up of bundled products, in part because of the historic separation of fixed and
mobile ownership. The acquisition by BT of EE in 2016 is expected to accelerate the trend for bundling fixed and
mobile propositions. However, the driver remains very much supply-push rather than demand-pull.

**BUSINESS**

**OVERVIEW**

**Introduction**

We are the UK’s leading value-for-money provider of fixed-line phone and broadband services to
residential and businesses customers. Our fixed-line services are offered through an extensive and
technologically advanced network, covering approximately 96% of UK’s homes. In addition to our fixed-line
connectivity offerings, we provide pay TV services through our part ownership of the YouView platform and
mobile services through an MVNO arrangement with Vodafone (which we intend to transition to Telefónica UK
during 2017). We offer our phone and broadband services both on a retail and wholesale basis, and leverage our
existing fixed-line customer base and our extensive fixed network to offer dual play (fixed-line phone and
broadband internet), triple play (dual play plus pay TV or mobile) and quad play (dual play plus pay TV and
mobile) products.

Our consumer business offers quad play products incorporating broadband internet, voice, pay TV and
mobile to Retail customers through a simple tariff structure and low prices. Our unique non-subscription pay TV
offering provides flexible access to free and pay-to-view third-party content through the YouView platform. As
at September 30, 2016, we had approximately 3.0 million Retail phone and broadband customers, approximately
1.3 million of which also subscribed to our pay TV service and approximately 793,000 were mobile customers.

Our fast growing B2B division, TTB, offers a wide range of data connectivity and next generation voice
products to businesses across the UK. We provide fixed-line phone, broadband internet (including high speed
Ethernet), data networking and other connectivity solutions to private companies and public sector organizations,
both directly and on a wholesale basis through approximately 850 partners. As at September 30, 2016, we had
approximately 899,000 Wholesale broadband and phone customers, and approximately 39,000 connected data
lines. We are one of only three national network providers in the UK that offer wholesale connectivity services,
broadband, FTTC and Ethernet to large national ISPs, such as the Post Office and Telecom Plus.

**Strengths**

Our strengths include the following:

   - Structurally attractive fixed-line market in the UK. The UK’s fixed-line market is structurally attractive
for an existing value-for-money provider of a national scale, such as the Group. Firstly, we believe it
would require a sizeable investment, in time and money, to roll-out a nationwide unbundled architecture
comparable with ours. Any such development would be extremely technologically challenging given,
among other things, physical constraints in BTOR’s exchanges where our network equipment is housed,
and BTOR’s capacity to deliver connections in those exchanges. Secondly, at present, the only
technological substitute for fixed-line connectivity is wireless data and voice traffic through a mobile
network. However, data transportation via a mobile network is significantly more expensive, radio
spectrum availability is constrained and finite and there is no evidence that such technological and
economic impediments could easily be overcome in the near future. This is against a backdrop of
exponentially growing data usage, driven by device proliferation and video so that mobile users are
expected to increase their data traffic from 0.96GB/month in 2015 to 5.6GB/month in 2020, while
households are expected to increase their fixed-line traffic from 84.5GB/month in 2015 to 202.1GB/
month in 2020 (Source: Cisco). Thirdly, there is a clear history of pro-competition regulation in our
industry over the last decade. Such regulation has been targeted at curtailing the powers of BT as the
incumbent provider and has promoted development of retail competitors on a national scale. We believe
that Ofcom will continue its policy to restrain BT’s ability to abuse its dominant market position, which
will ensure access to its core infrastructure on fair terms. As a result of these characteristics, whilst the
market for our services is promotionally intense, it remains fundamentally rational in terms of price
setting, allowing for inflationary price increases.

   - Advanced fixed-line infrastructure. Our fixed-line network currently covers approximately 96% of UK’s
homes with MPF and SMPF broadband. The only comparable fixed-line unbundled network is operated
by Sky, which covers approximately 90% of the UK’s population. At the same time, Virgin Media’s and
Vodafone’s fixed-line unbundled networks only cover approximately 55% and 60% of the country’s
population, respectively. At the heart of our network is the unbundling equipment (digital subscriber line
access multiplexers, multi-service access nodes and Ethernet switches) that we have installed in over
3,000 BT exchanges—the largest such deployment in the UK. This allows us to take control of the copper

80


-----

line that connects customer premises to the exchange. The exchanges are connected via collector nodes
and 10Gbps collector rings to more than 4,000 miles of our dark fibre core optical network—a highspeed, high-capacity all-IP national backbone that enables efficient and flexible routing of voice and data
traffic. The size and all IP nature of our network also allows us to scale it very efficiently for growing
usage, while driving down unit costs.

- Leading value-for-money positioning. Our network confers a structural cost advantage that has enabled
us to deliver value-for-money telecommunication services to customers, with our consumer fixed-line
propositions significantly less expensive than those offered by our competitors. Our value proposition
makes us the fourth largest residential fixed-line phone and broadband provider with a 14% market share,
based on customer numbers (Source: Ofcom). Our pay TV offer is focused on the large pool of valueconscious free to air households in the UK (which we estimate to be approximately 10 million households
nationwide) that have not historically wanted to participate in the premium subscription based pay TV
market. We focus on providing customers with flexible, non-subscription access to a wide range of thirdparty owned content and have grown to be the third largest operator in the pay TV market with an 8%
share based on customer numbers (Source: Ofcom). In addition, we offer mobile services through an
MVNO arrangement currently with Vodafone that we intend to transition to Telefónica UK during 2017.
This new MVNO arrangement will give us access to 4G and national roaming and allow us to build our
own thick core network.

We have leveraged our existing consumer fixed-line scale and our extensive network to drive growth in
dual play, triple play and quad play products. These products enable our customers to save significantly
more money, as compared to products offered by our competitors, while driving ARPU and reducing
customer churn. As the market moves towards triple and quad play bundles, our competitors are using the
bundles to protect a premium product in the bundle. Conversely, as we are the value provider in all four
products (phone, broadband, pay TV and mobile), the more products our customers take from us, the
more money we are able to save them relative to the competition.

Through TTB we provide a wide range of value-for-money connectivity solutions including basic phone
and broadband, high speed Ethernet, and legacy and next generation voice services. We have seen
particularly strong growth in our high margin data connections (Ethernet) business over the last three
years, with revenue growth compounding at over 30%. Our 2015 acquisition of tIPicall is helping us
forge a strong and fast growing IP-VPN to compliment this growth in data products. In addition, through
our wholesale partners that operate as ISPs, we provide phone, broadband and FTTC connectivity to over
900,000 end customers, giving us an approximately 35% share of UK’s wholesale market, second only to
BT.

- Strong track record of operational improvement. We have a strong proven track record of operational
improvement. Since the Demerger in 2010, we have delivered over £150 million of cost savings through
integration and back-office simplification programmes. This began with the integration of the Tiscali
business in 2010, which delivered over £100 million of gross cost savings, through significant back office
cost reductions, culminating in our most wide-ranging operational improvement programme, MTTS.
MTTS was launched in 2013 to deliver material customer service improvements, drive operating cost
savings, reduce subscriber acquisition costs and ultimately, create a simpler business which, in turn, is
intended to enable sustainable revenue growth through a transformed brand reputation. Cost savings from
MTTS totalled over £70 million from its introduction in 2013 to the date of this offering memorandum. In
particular, we made significant progress in the year ended March 31, 2016 on our operational efficiency
initiatives, including a comprehensive rebuilding of our online channels with enhanced security features,
a significant improvement in network performance, improvements to order provisioning through case
management, improvements in customer service through implementation of live chat and voice
biometrics and improved fault diagnosis and resolution, reducing engineering cost and unnecessary
customer contact. Further progress was made on all MTTS work streams in the six months ended
September 30, 2016, achieving £17 million in gross cost savings during that period. Our operational
improvements have resulted in the reduction in calls into our contact centres from approximately
2.5 million in July 2010 to approximately 1.0 million in July 2016 and a reduction of complaints filed
with Ofcom from approximately 1,000 in April 2012 to approximately 300 in July 2016, whilst at the
same time driving down churn on our on-net customer base to 1.4% per month in the three months ended
September 30, 2016.

- Proven historical performance and strengthening financial outlook. In the periods under review, we
have consistently generated strong revenues. We had £1,795 million and £1,838 million of headline

81


-----

revenue for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively, and £1,828 million of headline
revenue for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016. Our headline EBITDA and headline EBITDA
margin increased from £245 million and 13.6%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2015 to
£260 million and 14.1%, respectively, for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2016 and £300 million and
16.4% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2016.

Our capital expenditure cash outflows were £112 million, £166 million and £174 million for the years
ended March 31, 2015 and 2016 and twelve months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. This
represented 6.2%, 9.0% and 9.5% of our headline revenue for the respective periods. Following a period
of heightened expenditure on systems to support MTTS, mobile and FTTP we expect the ratio of capital
expenditure to revenues to revert to our normal 6%—7% from the year ending March 31, 2017. Our
leverage ratio was at the level of 2.4x, 2.6x and 2.8x for the years ended March 31, 2015 and 2016 and the
twelve months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, and an interest coverage ratio was at the level of
11.1x, 11.8x and 12.0x, respectively, for the same periods. We expect to substantially reduce our leverage
ratio for the year ended March 31 2017, and target a medium term ratio of 2.0x.

   - Highly experienced management team. Our senior management team has the combined expertise of
more than 90 years in the telecommunication industry. The Chairman of our Board of Directors, Sir
Charles Dunstone, founded the Group in 2002. Our Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Dido Harding, Baroness
Harding of Winscombe, joined us in 2010 from Sainsbury, where she was a member of the Operating
Board, having previously worked for Tesco in various senior positions. We believe that the collective
industry knowledge and leadership capabilities of our senior management team will enable us to continue
to successfully execute our strategy.

**Strategy**

Our business model is underpinned by our own next generation network, a sustainable regulatory cost
advantage over access to key parts of BT’s network infrastructure and a low cost operating model, which
collectively allow us to price competitively. The political and regulatory environment in which this framework
evolves is critical to our business model and presents significant opportunities for us. Our strategy is to:

   - Leverage and expand our network. The size and all-IP nature of our fixed-line network allow us to scale
it very efficiently for growing usage, enabling us to support growing customer demand for high speeds
and greater data consumption. We have a defined programme of investment in the network to increase
capacity and efficiency in line with the expected growth in demand for high speeds and data consumption.
In 2016, we completed the first phase of our backhaul upgrade (from 1GB to 10GB circuits) to deliver
significant improvements in network performance for our fibre customers.

We expect that network investments over the next two years will be focused on enhancing the capability
of our NGE and NGA networks. Having completed our NGE programme of upgrading all regional nodes
within our fixed-line network in 2016, we have begun to upweight exchanges on the new NGA
architecture, with over 100 expected to be completed by the end of March 2017. We expect another 3,000
exchanges to be completed over the next 18-24 months. This programme is expected to reduce our costs
to serve all our customers and drive further improvements in customer satisfaction.

Over the course of the next ten years we expect to see bandwidth usage across our network increase
10 times. These technology improvements will enable us to scale the network for this demand and will
allow us to substantially drive down our costs. By the end of our relatively modest network investment
programme we expect the entire data network to be brand new, simplified and functionally using the
latest Tier 1 capability. We will also strive to take advantage of regulatory developments, such as
regulatory dark fibre, to ensure an even more material step down in operating costs, putting us in a
position to deliver the significantly increased bandwidth and capacity that our customers are expected to
require.

   - Continue to provide value-for-money products. A structural cost advantage conferred by our existing
network enables us to be a value-for-money provider in all the products we sell. Following the launch of
fixed-line phone and broadband services in 2006, we have leveraged our network and fixed-line customer
base by offering additional value-for-money services to consumers such as Internet Protocol television
(“IPTV”), FTTC and mobile. Customers typically save more money with us the more products they take.
In addition, as we have designed our network for peak consumer usage during the evening, we are able to
leverage this capacity during the daytime for B2B customers, enabling us to offer a wide range of
value-for-money voice and data connectivity products to customers ranging from small office/home

82


-----

office businesses and small and medium sized enterprises to multi-site national enterprises. We believe
that our value-for-money positioning and growing product offer will continue to drive customer loyalty
and sustainable overall revenue growth through revenue-per-user growth from existing customers, (which
is significantly less expensive than increasing revenue by adding new customers). It will also ensure that
we are well positioned to take advantage of favourable usage and socio-demographic trends, with a
growing number of older and smaller households in the UK, growing data usage and growing triple and
quad play penetration.

- Achieve significant scale. Network capability, cost advantage and the ability to offer multiple value-formoney services has enabled us to build a large and sustainable share (approximately 16%) of the UK
fixed- line broadband market (Source: Ofcom). We have leveraged this position to drive growth in TV
(approximately 37% of phone and broadband base), mobile (approximately 22% of phone and broadband
base) and FTTC (approximately 21% of phone and broadband base) bases. We expect that our quad-play
approach will put us in a position to further capitalize on the growing trend amongst UK consumers to
save money by taking bundled products on top of their fixed-line subscriptions. We expect the majority of
our customers to subscribe for all four products in the future, underpinning our scale growth opportunity.

Our B2B division, which is already a scale business, with revenues of over £500 million in the year ended
March 31, 2016, has material further opportunities to grow in the fragmented B2B market. In particular,
our B2B division currently has a 10%-12% share of the UK’s national and metro Ethernet market, where
current forecasts of 11% CAGR (Source: Ovum) would take our share to around 16% by 2020. In
addition, our share in the IP-VPN market is currently approximately 2% and, while the market is forecast
to grow at a CAGR of 2% (Source: Ovum), we see a significant growth opportunity. We also see steady
growth opportunities in our wholesale phone and broadband business.

- Simplify systems and processes to achieve further operational efficiency. As a relatively young business
that has grown very rapidly since the Demerger, we have a significant opportunity to further simplify our
technology platform and customer processes to deliver a higher quality and more secure customer
experience.

MTTS is our Group-wide ranging transformation programme that is delivering material customer service
improvements, reducing churn, driving operating cost savings, reducing subscriber acquisition costs and
ultimately, creating a simpler, better business and transformed brand reputation. We aim to continue our
work on all components of MTTS to deliver a seamless self-service operating model which will be better
for customers and lower cost to operate. We expect this to result in a further £35 million to £40 million of
savings, through improved customer services, in the year ending March 31, 2017 (of which £17 million
have already been delivered during the six months ended September 30, 2016), and annualised savings
beyond this period are expected to be at a substantially higher level.

- Drive disruptive innovation. We have a strong heritage of launching innovative and disruptive products
that leverage our network scale, engineering expertise and cost advantage to save customers money. We
were the first fixed-line operator in the UK to offer free fixed-line calls between customers, free
broadband, unlimited downloads to broadband customers, network level home internet security, a free TV
product (on the YouView platform), business broadband at under £5 per month and free nuisance and
suspicious call blocking.

Our two key future innovation opportunities are FTTP and inside-out mobile.

O We have made significant progress towards achieving critical success factors (cost per home,
customer experience and penetration) in our FTTP proof of concept in York and are taking
measured steps to further test the economics of a broader roll-out. Our initial build has covered
nearly 14,000 homes, with over 2,500 customers signing up to the service with us and Sky since
the beginning of 2016 (over 18% penetration in the six months ended September 30, 2016). Build
costs have come at £417 per home, significantly under our £500 per home target, and customer
take-up and satisfaction are also running ahead of targets. Following the success of this first phase,
we plan to begin extending the network across the rest of York. The roll-out is expected to start in
the Spring of 2017 and reach a further 40,000 homes over a period of 18 months, covering the vast
majority of the city’s premises. Our York project was conceived as a joint venture with Sky and
City Fibre Holdings, but we plan to acquire Sky’s equity in the joint venture in 2017, with Sky
becoming a long term wholesale customer. The full York roll-out is expected to cost us
approximately £20 million over 18 months to complete.

83


-----

Beyond York and depending on us successfully proving the economics of the build, we plan to
investigate the feasibility of a larger parallel build across five to six cities in different parts of the
UK, involving approximately 150,000 homes. Building work on any such extended pilot is
unlikely to begin until the year ending March 31, 2019. If the results of this pilot prove the
economics of FTTP then there will be a long-term potential of reaching five to ten million homes
over a ten year minimum build time. Such network development is expected to be funded with
external capital, consistent with our existing financing policy.

O Separately, we are in the advanced stages of a femtocell testing programme that is expected to
lead to the roll-out of active cells in customers’ homes from 2018/19. These indoor cells will
allow mobile traffic to be offloaded onto our fixed-line network, thereby delivering a much
improved indoor mobile experience and savings on the costs payable under our MVNO
arrangements.

Both these innovations will allow us to deliver disruptive value-for-money propositions that leverage
the economics of our fixed-line network.

**HISTORY**

Created in 2004 as the telecommunication division of CPW, a retailer of mobile phones and related
products, the Group was demerged and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2010.

We have a long history of positive disruption and challenging industry conventions. Having launched a
market-beating voice offer in 2004, we began building our unbundled local loop network in 2005. In 2006 we
launched the UK’s first ever free broadband offer. This marked a pivotal moment in the evolution of the UK
telecommunication sector, and firmly established the Group as the value-for-money champion in the market.

Increased competition and uptake in connectivity services, coupled with a compelling pricing proposition,
fuelled significant growth for the business over subsequent years. Through a combination of acquisitions and
organic growth, we expanded rapidly, acquiring the businesses of AOL UK and Tiscali UK in 2007 and 2009,
respectively. In 2010, we began offering additional consumer services in the form of mobile SIMs. We
completed our suite of quad play services with the launch of a flexible, value-for-money pay TV service and
mobile handsets in 2012. In 2015, we acquired the Tesco’s broadband service business, comprised of broadband
(MPF, SMPF, and IP Stream) and voice customers. We also acquired 100% of TalkTalk TV Entertainment
Limited (formerly Blinkbox) from Tesco Holdings Limited, which provides movies and TV series online for
on-demand streaming and downloading.

Our B2B division, TTB, was founded in 1995 as Opal Telecom. TTB has capitalised on the scale,
performance and reach of our network to create a portfolio of business grade connectivity and hosted solutions,
available either direct or through a wide range of wholesale partners.

TTB has consistently demonstrated significant growth and is the only wholesale provider of broadband and
Ethernet connectivity outside of BT Group. It now serves over 180,000 businesses across the UK.

**PRODUCTS AND SERVICES**

**Services to consumers**

We provide value-for-money phone, broadband, fibre, TV, and mobile to UK homes, differentiated by a
clear and simple tariff structure, low prices, flexibility and the inclusion of valuable services, such as unlimited
broadband usage, call monitoring, voicemail and HomeSafe[®], our market-leading network-based security
service. We also offer mobile services to our phone and broadband customers through a MVNO agreement with
Vodafone that we intend to transition to a new MVNO relationship with Telefónica UK during 2017. Our TV
proposition has been built on the YouView platform (a joint venture between the Group, BT, Arqiva and the
UK’s public service broadcasters BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5). It is an internet-enabled television
service delivered via a dedicated set top box with differentiated catch-up and on-demand services, and an open
platform for future application-driven innovation. It is uniquely non-subscription based and includes access to the
TalkTalk TV Store for all broadband customers—a service we have built following the acquisition of Blinkbox
in 2015. Our bundled packaging and pricing are designed to encourage our customers to purchase multiple
services across our product portfolio by offering incentives to customers who subscribe to two or more of our
products.

**_Broadband and fibre (superfast broadband)_**

At the beginning of October 2016, we replaced all of our existing consumer connectivity tariffs with a new,
radically simpler range of fixed low price plans. These new plans give customers the freedom to choose and fix
their own package for 18 months by tailoring mix-and-match broadband, mobile, TV and land-line calls to suit
their needs. Customers can choose between two new simple packages, each inclusive of line rental: “Fast
Broadband” and “Faster Fibre Broadband”.

_“Fast Broadband”_

“Fast Broadband” is our standard fixed price broadband plan designed to cater for the needs of individual
users or households that do not require increased download speeds available via a fibre connection. Broadband
connectivity is provided via a standard analog telephone line using the ADSL technology, which allows for
download speeds of up to 17Mbps. The plan also includes (i) our “Essential SIM” feature, providing
200 minutes, unlimited SMS and 500MB of data and (ii) access to the TalkTalk TV Store.

|---|---|


-----

As at March 31, 2015 and 2016 and September 30, 2016, we had approximately 3.4 million, 3.2 million and
3.1 million Retail phone and broadband customers, respectively.

_“Faster Fibre Broadband”_

“Faster Fibre Broadband” plan is designed for households with a number of devices that need to be
connected to the internet at the same time. Fibre broadband connectivity is provided via our FTTC network using
the VDSL technology, which allows for download speeds of up to 38Mbps. This is approximately 4.5 times
faster than UK’s average standard ADSL download speeds. Customers are able to further enhance their
broadband internet experience with one of our “Broadband Boosts”: fixed fibre speed boost, allowing to increase
download speeds to up to 76Mbps, which is approximately 17 times faster uploading and approximately 7 times
faster downloading than UK’s average standard ADSL speeds. The plan also includes (i) our “Essential SIM”
feature, providing 200 minutes, unlimited SMS and 500MB of data and (ii) access to the TalkTalk TV Store.

As at March 31, 2015 and 2016 and September 30, 2016, we had approximately 0.5 million, 0.7 million and
0.8 million fibre customers, respectively.

Uniquely in the market, we have also made these new plans available to all of our existing customers (on
legacy tariffs, such as Simply Broadband, Essentials TV and Plus TV) who are able to move to these plans by
re-contracting with us for 18 months. Our existing customers have responded extremely well to the new plans. In
particular: (a) ten times as many customers have re-contracted than in an average month, (b) many more have
chosen the “Faster Fibre Broadband” plan than expected, (c) attachment rates for calling and TV boosts have also
been stronger than we had expected. These outcomes reflect the attractiveness of our simple and clear pricing,
and while the take up on the new plans might be at a lower ARPU, the 18 months re-contracting will help reduce
churn. Customers who chose not to re-contract will pay an approximately 9%-10% price increase on their
existing packages.

**_Mobile_**

We offer mobile exclusively to our existing phone and broadband customers under an MVNO agreement
with Vodafone, that we intend to transition to Telefónica UK during 2017. The change in MVNO will provide us
with access to 4G, the opportunity to build our own thick core and ultimately offload mobile traffic onto our
femto small cell network. We have made progress in the first phase of testing the migration of customers from
Vodafone to Telefónica UK MVNO. This process involves moving existing mobile customers onto our new
CRM and billing platform and launching a 4G service on Telefónica UK’s network for new customers. In the
six months ended September 30, 2016, we deployed our new platforms to live environments, provisioned our
own TalkTalk 4G SIMs on the Telefónica UK network and made available live calls, SMSs, data sessions and
number porting with other MNOs. Following the completion of this design and test phase, we intend to begin
bulk billing migrations and service launch on the Telefónica UK network during Spring 2017, followed by
network migrations.

Our mobile proposition is aimed primarily at households that want secondary or tertiary devices or SIM
cards. While we offer a wide and expanding range of mid-priced handsets under post pay contracts, we see the
longer term opportunity to be very much SIM-driven, with multiple SIM contracts per household driving ARPU
growth and reducing churn.

As at March 31, 2015 and 2016 and September 30, 2016, we had approximately 0.5 million, 0.7 million and
0.8 million mobile customers, respectively.

**_TV_**

Our pay TV offer, available only to TalkTalk fixed-line customers, launched in 2012, is exclusively
non-subscription based and aimed at approximately 10 million UK households that have not historically
participated in the premium subscription-based pay TV market. Although we do not commission or own rights to
TV programmes, we aim to give our customers as wide a range of content as possible. We provide flexible access
to over 80 free-to-air channels, an advanced interactive programme guide and an extensive range of premium
1 month subscription and pay-to-view services. To that end, we have commercial relationships with key content
suppliers, such as Sky, BT Sports and Netflix. As a value-for-money provider offering customers control over
their content costs, we appeal to a different segment, as compared to other TV providers, and therefore are able to
offer content owners access to incremental revenues.

Our customers are able to take TV services on a minimum 30 day commitment, often as their first venture
into pay TV. Our user-friendly platform guides them through the selection process, whether signing up for a
month’s commitment or a pay-per-view film and all purchases are added to their monthly bill.

86


-----

In April 2016, we launched the TalkTalk TV Store, one of the UK’s most comprehensive internet streaming
television services that allows our broadband customers to stream live television channels and watch on demand
content through their web browser, anywhere in the UK with a broadband connection. Customers are able to also
discover new shows with customized recommendations and ratings. Customers with iOS or Android mobile
devices can also watch television channels, manage their TalkTalk TV boxes and discover new shows on their
mobile devices.

During the six months ended September 30, 2016, we concluded a number of content deals including the
renewal of our full Sky content for a further three years. This enables our customers to continue viewing leading
pay TV channels, including Sky1, Sky Living, Sky Arts, as well as the full portfolio of Sky Sports and Sky
Cinema, and Sky Box Office PPV events. In June 2016, we also added BT Sports, so coupled with Sky Sports
our customers can now watch all leading sports in the UK, including Formula 1, Ryder Cup, and all English
Premier League football games.

Our strategy of making the broadest content available on the most flexible terms is based on our long term
commitment to the YouView platform, which continues to grow in value. We have recently commenced the
roll-out of our next generation YouView software across the existing set top box base. This will offer a
significantly enhanced and market leading user interface as well as performance, further improving engagement
with our TV customers.

As at March 31, 2015 and 2016 and September 30, 2016, we had approximately 1.4 million, 1.4 million and
1.3 million TV customers, respectively.

**Services to business customers**

We offer an extensive range of fixed-line services to our B2B customers, a significant and fast growing part
of the business. We serve the connectivity needs of over 180,000 businesses from national retailers to sole traders
and public sector customers nationwide. We offer a wide range of voice and data solutions to customers ranging
from small office/home office and SME customers, through to multi-site national enterprises. We access the
market either directly or through partner channels with approximately 80% of revenue generated through
wholesale partners. Through the partner channel, we are one of only three network providers in the UK to offer
wholesale phone and broadband services to independent internet service providers (such as the Post Office and
Utility Warehouse), for whom in total we service nearly 900,000 end customers on our network.

Our B2B division is organised around our products and channels to market. Through the Direct channel, we
offer a range of data solutions from Business Broadband & Fibre, through to high value Ethernet circuits, and
Wide Area Networks (MPLS IP-VPN). Across our voice portfolio we also offer both “Legacy Voice” and “Next
Generation Voice” services (e.g., B2B SIP VoIP and Hosted Unified Comms).

Through our Partner channel we provide both “managed” and “wholesale” solutions. Voice and data
revenues are generated through long term relationships, several of which are multi-year contracts. Our managed
partners primarily address the consumer and small business market, delivering voice, broadband and fibre.
Having a wholesale offering allows us to work with Systems Integrators, such as Fujitsu, who often combine
connectivity and data solutions from multiple providers to offer large customers a bespoke solution. This allows
us to focus on our core offering, without having to offer complex and margin dilutive products and services
demanded by larger customers.

Our suite of data connectivity products, which are typically subject to multi-year contracts, offer different
bandwidths and low cost price options. Building from broadband, through to FTTC, EFM and ultimately EAD,
we offer competitively priced high speed connectivity that exploits our significant network capability and reach.
Data revenues generate returns significantly in excess of our average and are the fastest growing product set by
revenue in our offering to corporates, with a significant and accelerating pipeline of data connections.

The Voice segment of the business product offering comprises declining legacy revenues and our newly
launched, next generation voice product powered by our recent tIPicall acquisition, which gives us significant
capability in the B2B SIP VoIP market.

TTB also provides voice interconnect services (Carrier) to a range of international mobile operators
terminating calls in the UK.

**LEGAL PROCEEDINGS**

We may from time to time become involved in various claims and lawsuits arising in the ordinary course of
our business. Except as disclosed in this offering memorandum, we are not currently involved in any material

87


-----

legal, governmental or arbitration proceedings which would, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our
business, results of operations or financial condition, and, we are not aware of any governmental, legal or
arbitration proceedings (including any such proceedings which are pending or threatened of which we are aware),
during the past three years, which may have, or have had in the recent past, significant effects on our financial
position or profitability.

**INDUSTRY REGULATION**

**OVERVIEW**

Our business activities, and those of BT, our largest supplier, are subject to the laws and regulations of the
EU and the UK. At the EU level, we are regulated by a variety of legal instruments and policies, collectively
referred to as the “Common Regulatory Framework”, regulating the establishment and operation of electronic
communications networks and the provision of electronic communications services, such as telephony, internet
access and, to some degree, television services. The Common Regulatory Framework does not generally address
issues of content. The Common Regulatory Framework primarily seeks to open European markets for
communications services and comprises:

   - Directive 2002/21 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and
services;

   - Directive 2002/20 on the authorization of electronic communications networks and services;

   - Directive 2002/19 on access to, and interconnection of, electronic communications networks and
associated facilities; and

   - Directive 2002/22 on universal service and users rights relating to electronic communications networks
and services.

These Directives are supplemented by EU Directive 2002/58, regulating the processing of personal data and
the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.

In the UK, the Common Regulatory Framework is implemented through (i) the Communications Act 2003,
which regulates all forms of communications technology, whether used for telecommunication or broadcasting,
and (ii) the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006, which regulates radio communications (including with respect to the
spectrum, licensing arrangements, usage conditions and charges, license bidding and trading and enforcement
and penalties). The Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003, as amended, implemented EU
Directive 2002/58, regulating the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic
communications sector.

We are also subject to regulation under the UK Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 and other UK statutes and
subordinate legislation, including the Competition Act 1998, the Enterprise Act 2002 and the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Act 2013.

The UK telecommunication market is regulated by Ofcom, which, amongst other objectives, sets the
charges and other terms for wholesale access to infrastructure and associated services provided by BT, where BT
is deemed to enjoy “Significant Market Power.” Most of the wholesale products we purchase from BT are
provided by BTOR. Ofcom’s objective is to serve consumers’ interests through encouraging investment and
ensuring that these wholesale products enable effective competition in the retail market, so that consumers and
businesses benefit from a choice of attractive services and retail service providers.

We rely upon a number of wholesale products from BTOR to be able to offer services to our customers. The
key wholesale products are LLU (the copper connections into homes/businesses), GEA (access to BT’s FTTC
network) and Ethernet (fibre links used to connect exchanges to our core network and also to connect some
business customers). The price and terms of these are set by Ofcom though a triennial market review process
which, particularly in the case of LLU and Ethernet, gives us reasonable certainty of future costs.

We, along with other communication providers, are required to comply with various regulation and
legislation. Our compliance with regulation is monitored internally by the Regulatory Compliance Committee.

**ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION SERVICES**

**Ofcom Strategic Review of Digital Communications**

Following a consultation in July 2015, Ofcom published the “initial conclusions” from its Strategic Review
of Digital Communications (the “Strategic Review”) in February 2016, which is able to take a longer term, more
holistic view than the triennial market reviews. Though this did not set new regulation, it did provide a high level
strategy and outline market and regulatory direction for the next decade that included: encouraging more FTTP
investment by BT’s rivals (through improving wholesale access to BT’s ducts and poles); possible introduction
of fully regulated pricing through charge controls on GEA rather than the current minimum margin regulation;
increasing the degree of independence of BTOR from BT, possibly including structural separation and a “step
change” in BTOR’s service quality. Some of these strategic changes will be implemented through the triennial
market reviews. The question of BTOR separation is being considered separately to the market reviews.

89


-----

In July 2016, Ofcom proposed its solution that BTOR should be set up as a wholly owned subsidiary of BT
(referred to as “legal separation”), though it is keeping open the option of structural separation which Ofcom
CEO, Sharon White, has stated may be “the cleanest and most clear-cut long term solution.” We have been vocal
in urging the regulator to take a bold approach, and the Government has called on Ofcom to “take whatever
action is needed to correct the competition problems identified, and to promote the growth of the digital
economy, however radical a change that might be.” Whilst legal separation will reduce BT’s ability to abuse its
vertical integration (as accepted by Ofcom) and should therefore benefit us, we are clear that only structural
separation can deliver the full benefits to the UK market.

Full structural separation would guarantee BT could not use its ownership of BTOR for the commercial
benefit of its retail division (through preferential product design and pricing); nor could it divert BTOR profit
away from improving network performance for customers in order to finance other corporate priorities. The
guarantee of a more competitive retail market would also act as an incentive for alternative infrastructure
investment.

In November 2016, Ofcom announced that it intended to mandate legal separation of BTOR from BT after
BT failed to offer voluntary proposals that would address competition concerns to Ofcom’s satisfaction. Such
separation will require BTOR to become a distinct company with its own independent board of directors and
ownership and control of its assets and resources. Ofcom has specifically stated that if legal separation cannot be
made to work, then full structural separation remains an option. Currently Ofcom is considering a more detailed
legal separation proposal. It is expected to notify and consult with the European Commission accordingly in early
2017. Such consultations are required to allow Ofcom to implement the proposed solution.

Whether BT is structurally or legally separated, we would expect reductions in the wholesale price of GEA,
and thus a reduction in our wholesale costs. If BTOR is fully separated, it would nonetheless remain a regulated
monopoly and the arguments for bringing down the wholesale price of GEA are equally applicable. Moreover, it
would be economically rational for the separated entity to support such a reduction in order to drive take up on
their network from all CPs. Such a position is clearly not rational for BTOR, whilst it is owned by BT and
therefore incentivised to protect BT’s retail share. Given the increasing degree of public and political scrutiny
currently being brought to bear on BT (and increasingly on Ofcom itself), a charge control on GEA becomes
even more likely should the regulator opt for what is widely considered the “softer decision” to merely legally
separate BTOR.

**Broadband Services**

_LLU charge control and service standards_

In June 2014, Ofcom published the Fixed Access Market Review (“FAMR”), which included the new LLU
charge control for the period to March 31, 2017. Metallic Path Facility (the facility that enables both the
provision of voice and broadband services) charges rose from £83.92 to £86.11. The FAMR also established new
minimum standards on BT for provisioning and repair of copper access lines, as well as a new requirement for
BT to report a range of key performance indicators. Ofcom is expected to begin formally consulting in early 2017
on the next FAMR and LLU charge control. The review has been delayed whilst Ofcom conducts the Strategic
Review and is unlikely to be completed until early 2018. The methodology that Ofcom will use to set LLU prices
for the forthcoming period is well established and based on the regulatory accounts of BTOR. The most recent
regulatory accounts have been produced following changes to the cost attribution methodology decided on by
Ofcom that significantly reduce BT’s costs allocated to BTOR and increase the costs allocated to other BT
divisions. This is likely to result in the future LLU charge being lower than the current charge. Ofcom is taking
various steps to ensure regulation continues during the gap between market reviews and has so far refused to
accept proposals from BTOR to keep LLU charges flat between April 2016 and a when new charge control is
imposed.

_GEA charge control_

BTOR provides wholesale access to its fibre infrastructure (predominantly FTTC), on an equivalent basis to
all communication providers. BTOR’s wholesale product is called GEA. We use GEA to provide our fibre
broadband products. Whilst the price of GEA is not currently regulated, we had called on Ofcom to introduce
“margin squeeze regulation”, establishing a minimum margin between BTOR’s wholesale GEA price and BT’s
retail price. In March 2015, Ofcom confirmed that margin squeeze regulation would come into effect from April
2015, with the first compliance report published in June 2015. Both BT and us appealed the decision (on
different grounds). The Competition Appeals Tribunal dismissed all key aspects of BT’s appeal and all of our
appeal.

90


-----

Ofcom’s upcoming FAMR will consider regulation of GEA, including whether a charge control should be
imposed and, if so, how it should be designed. Ofcom’s proposals will be set out in a consultation in early 2017.
In May 2016, Ofcom published a consultation on its proposed approach to modelling the costs of GEA. This
analysis data would be used in the event that a charge control is applied and is the first step in the process
towards imposing a charge control. Analysis we have commissioned from Frontier Economics suggests that were
a charge control to be introduced using the same methodology as LLU, it would be around £3 (compared with
£7.60 current average price). Whilst Ofcom might not require an immediate reduction in prices to £3, it is clear
that were a charge control to be introduced, it would be lower than the current price we pay.

_Duct and pole access_

Ofcom set out in its Strategic Review that it would improve wholesale access to BT’s ducts and poles so that
BT’s rivals could use these assets to roll-out their own FTTP networks. Ofcom will likely impose specific
regulation on BT as part of its FAMR including: better information availability, a requirement on BT to use the
wholesale products itself and improved operational processes. In December 2016, Ofcom outlined further
proposals that would make using BT’s duct and poles more feasible including allowing them to be used for
providing leased lines and charge controls on the prices BTOR can charge. Duct and pole access could benefit us
by reducing the cost and increasing the speed of roll-out of our own FTTP network.

_Universal Service Obligation_

The UK Government is attempting to drive the deployment of superfast broadband to 95% of the population
of the UK by 2017 using money from the publicly funded BBC Licence Fee, under-spend from the Analogue TV
Switch-Off Project and other sources of public investment to stimulate private investment. To achieve this aim,
the Government established: (i) the Broadband Delivery UK programme, which is focused on delivering
broadband to areas that the market will not serve of its own accord (mainly rural areas); and (ii) the Urban
Broadband Fund, which intended to establish “super connected” cities with internet capabilities of between
80 Mbps to 100 Mbps and comprehensive mobile broadband coverage.

In November 2015, then Prime Minister David Cameron announced an intention to introduce a broadband
Universal Service Obligation (“USO”), with the ambition to give people the legal right to request a connection to
broadband speeds of 10Mbps. Government is bringing forward legislation in the Digital Economy Bill to give the
Secretary of State an explicit power to introduce a new broadband USO and require Ofcom to review the USO to
ensure it continues to meet minimum connectivity requirements. Ofcom reported to Government in December
2016 on the key factors affecting the design of the USO. Government plans to launch a consultation on the scope
of the USO, along with draft secondary legislation, in early 2017. We are working closely with Government and
Ofcom on the issue. Notably, the Government has specified that the USO must not be detrimental to wider
competition, stating that it “will need to be designed to minimise any market distortion.” Ofcom has made it clear
publicly that it does not think that BT’s USO commitment should be linked to Ofcom’s decisions on BTOR
separation or GEA charge control.

**Business Connectivity Market Regulation**

In May 2016, Ofcom published the final statement of its Business Connectivity Market Review, which sets
regulation for the dedicated fibre connections which are used by businesses, and as backhaul connections for
LLU and mobile networks. The regulation included: price reductions averaging 40% over the next three years,
minimum service standards for Ethernet circuits provisioning (where quality has been very poor for over three
years) and an obligation for BT to offer a dark fibre access product to be launched by October 2017. The new
regulation will benefit us in several ways, including: immediate costs reductions, the opportunity to lower costs
further through using dark fibre, ability to innovate our products and an improvement in provisioning quality,
which will increase customer satisfaction.

**Mobile telephony**

_EU roaming regulations for mobile telephony services_

As an MVNO, we are subject to EU regulations relating to retail prices for roaming services. These
regulations set limits on certain wholesale and retail tariffs for international mobile voice roaming, SMS tariffs
and data roaming within the EU, provide for greater levels of transparency of retail pricing information, impose
measures to guard against bill shock in respect of data roaming and set maximum roaming rates within the EU.

In November 2015, the EU passed legislation on the maximum retail roaming surcharges that apply from
April 30, 2016 and the removal of roaming surcharges from June 15, 2017. The European Commission is

reviewing the wholesale roaming market, fair use policies and sustainability mechanisms required to implement
this policy. We are engaging with the review and implementing the required changes to our roaming tariffs.

_Switching_

Ofcom is consulting on proposals to reform switching of mobile communications services. It expects to
publish its conclusions in Spring 2017. It is also continuing its work on switching of triple play services and is
due to publish its policy statement in Summer 2017. We continue to engage with Ofcom on these reforms. The
Government has introduced measures to make it easier for consumers to switch between telecommunication and
TV providers in the Digital Economy Bill. The bill is currently being debated in Parliament. We are supportive of
a simpler, more customer friendly switching regime, which we believe will favour a value-for-money provider
such as ourselves and are working closely with Government on the issue. Indications to date are that this bill will
pass.

**TELEVISION AND VIDEO-ON-DEMAND REGULATION**

In the UK, we are required to hold individual licenses under the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996 for any
television channels (including barker channels) which we own or operate and for the provision of certain other
services on our cable television platform, such as electronic programme guides. These television licensable
content service (“TLCS”) licenses are granted and administered by Ofcom. Under these licenses, each covered
service must comply with a number of Ofcom codes, including the Broadcasting Code, and with all directions
issued by Ofcom. Breach of any of the terms of a TLCS license may result in the imposition of fines on the
license holder and, ultimately, the license being revoked.

As a provider of On-Demand Programme Services (“ODPS”), we must comply with a number of statutory
obligations in relation to “editorial content” and notify Ofcom of our intention to provide ODPS. Failure to notify
Ofcom or comply with the relevant statutory obligations may result in the imposition of fines or, ultimately, the
prohibition on providing an ODPS.

Ofcom previously imposed a Wholesale Must Offer (“WMO”) obligation on Sky, following a finding that
Sky has market power in the wholesale supply of certain premium sports and premium movie channels. The
WMO required Sky to offer Sky Sports 1 and 2 on a wholesale basis to other retailers at regulated prices. In
December 2015, Ofcom published a statement withdrawing the WMO obligation on Sky since it considered that
it was no longer necessary, though it would reassess the need for regulation if supply did not continue to be
provided on reasonable terms. This change in regulation does not directly affect us since we have commercial
arrangements with Sky, which we have recently successfully renewed.

**OTHER MATERIAL CURRENT OR POTENTIAL REGULATION**

**European Commission Digital Single Market**

In May 2015, the European Commission published 16 initiatives as part of the Digital Single Market
agenda. The measures seek to strengthen access to digital goods and services across Europe, improve regulatory
frameworks and strengthen digital growth by tackling issues such as skills shortages. The European Commission
is currently consulting on the proposals. We believe that major changes are unlikely to come into force before
2018.

**Appeals reform**

A further significant change proposed in the Digital Economy Bill is the strengthening of the regime for
legal appeals against Ofcom decisions. The Government proposes imposing a higher standard for appealing
Ofcom’s decisions, thus putting Ofcom on a similar footing to other UK sector regulators. We are supportive of
this change, as a stronger, more confident regulator, and a process that does not favour the biggest businesses
with the largest legal budgets, will be beneficial to us.

**Investigatory Powers Bill**

The Investigatory Powers Act 2016, which consolidates and updates existing legislation governing the
retention and sharing of communications data received royal assent on November 29, 2016. We worked with
Government on the details of the legislation and how it would apply to the business.

**Illegal file sharing**

We, along with other major ISPs, have voluntarily agreed to send educational notifications to customers
who have an IP address assigned to their account, which has been detected as being used for illegal Peer to Peer

92


-----

file sharing. The first notifications are expected to be sent in early 2017. Separately, and pursuant to various court
orders, we are required to block access to certain sites that are used for illegal file sharing and for trademark
infringement.

**Overall trends**

Overall, the regulatory climate for telecommunication services providers in the UK is one that increasingly
favors challenger businesses such as ourselves. Ofcom and UK Government have consistently stated over the last
12 months that they see competition as the driver of the investment in telecommunication infrastructure that they
seek, and are now acting to deliver that. The combination of recommendations in Ofcom’s Digital
Communications Review including significantly tougher oversight of BTOR, access to dark fibre, ducts and
poles and change in appeals regime are all actions that favor challenger businesses such as ourselves, and curb
the supplier power that BT has over us.

there are two long term incentive plans—the Discretionary Share Option Plan (“DSOP”) and the Shareholder
Value Plan (“SVP”), operating under the rules of the Value Enhancement Scheme (“VES”). These plans do not
run concurrently. The SVP is an alternative reward mechanism for Executive Directors and other members of the
senior leadership team who will not participate in the DSOP. The Remuneration Committee intends that,
generally, in any one year, participants may only receive an award under the SVP and no other long term
incentive plan. The Remuneration Committee reviews, at least on an annual basis, pay-out levels for Executive
Directors at minimum, “on target”, “stretch” and “super stretch” levels of performance, in order to ensure
alignment with our shareholders.

Total compensation for our Board of Directors and the members of the Executive Committee for the year
ended March 31, 2016 was £7.3 million.

**DESCRIPTION OF THE NOTES**

In this “Description of the Notes,” the word “Issuer” refers only to TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC and not to
any of its Subsidiaries (as defined hereafter), except for the purposes of financial data determined on a
consolidated basis. The word “Notes,” unless the context requires otherwise, also refers to “book entry interests”
in the Notes, as defined herein. The definitions of certain other terms used in this description are set forth
throughout the text or under “—Certain Definitions.”

The Issuer will issue £300,000,000 aggregate principal amount of % Senior Notes due 2022 (the
“Notes”) under an indenture dated on or about, 2017 (the “Indenture”) between, among others, the
Issuer, the Guarantors and BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited, as trustee (the “Trustee”). The
terms of the Notes include those set forth in the Indenture.

The Indenture is unlimited in aggregate principal amount, of which £300,000,000 aggregate principal
amount of Notes will be issued in this Offering. We may in the future, subject to applicable law, issue an
unlimited principal amount of additional Notes having identical terms and conditions (other than the Issue Date)
as the Notes (together with the Notes, the “Additional Notes”). We will only be permitted to issue Additional
Notes in compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture, including the covenant restricting the
Incurrence of Debt (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Debt”). The Notes and any
Additional Notes will be treated as a single class for all purposes under the Indenture, including, without
limitation, with respect to waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.

The following description is a summary of the material terms of the Indenture. It does not, however, restate
the Indenture in its entirety and where reference is made to a particular provision of the Indenture, such
reference, including the definitions of certain terms, is qualified in its entirety by reference to all of the
provisions of the Notes and the Indenture. You should read the Indenture and the Notes because they contain
additional information and because they and not this description define your rights as a Holder of the Notes. A
copy of the Indenture may be obtained from the Issuer at the address indicated under “Listing and General
_Information.” The Indenture is not qualified under, does not incorporate provisions by reference to, and is not_
otherwise subject to, the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the “TIA”) including Section 316(b)
thereof.

The Issuer will make an application to The Channel Islands Securities Exchange Authority Limited (the
“Exchange”) for the listing of, and the permission to deal in the Notes, on the Official List of the Exchange. The
Issuer can provide no assurance that this application will be accepted. See “—Payments on the Notes—Paying
_Agent.”_

The registered Holder of a Note will be treated as the owner of it for all purposes. Only registered Holders
will have rights under the Indenture.

**Brief Description of the Structure and Ranking of the Notes and the Guarantees**

**_The Notes_**

The Notes:

(a) are the Issuer’s general unsecured obligations;

(b) mature on, 2022;

subordinated in right of payment to the Notes;

(d) are structurally subordinated to all existing and future debt of Subsidiaries of the Issuer that do not
provide Guarantees;

(e) are effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured debt of the Issuer to the extent of the
assets securing such debt; and

100


-----

(c) is effectively subordinated to all existing and future secured debt of such Guarantor to the extent of
the assets securing such debt; and

(d) ranks senior in right of payment to any and all of such Guarantor’s existing and future debt that is

**_General_**

As at September 30, 2016, after giving effect to the Offering and the use of proceeds therefrom, total
borrowings of the Issuer and Guarantors and the non-guarantor subsidiaries would have been £880 million and
£nil million, respectively.

The Guarantors represented 94.9% of our headline revenue, 87.2% of our headline EBITDA and 96.7% of
our total assets for the year ended March 31, 2016 and 94.8% of our headline revenue, 85.6% of our headline
EBITDA; and 96.7% of our total assets for the six months ended September 30, 2016.

The Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all Debt and other liabilities and commitments
(including trade payables and lease obligations) of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries that are not Guarantors. Any right of
the Issuer to receive assets of any of its Subsidiaries upon the Subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization (and the
consequent right of the Holders to participate in those assets) will be effectively subordinated to the claims of
that Subsidiary’s creditors, except to the extent that the Issuer is itself recognized as a creditor of the Subsidiary,
in which case the claims of the Issuer would still be subordinated in right of payment to any security in the assets
of the Subsidiary and any Debt of the Subsidiary senior to that held by the Issuer.

As at the Issue Date, all of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries will be “Restricted Subsidiaries.” However, under the
circumstances described below under “—Certain Covenants—Designation of Restricted and Unrestricted
_Subsidiaries,” the Issuer will be permitted to designate certain of its Subsidiaries as “Unrestricted Subsidiaries.”_
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not be subject to the restrictive covenants in the Indenture. Further,
Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer will not Guarantee the Notes.

Although the Indenture contains limitations on the amount of additional Debt that the Issuer, the Guarantors
and the Restricted Subsidiaries may incur, the amount of such additional Debt could be substantial. The
Indenture will permit additional Debt to be secured.

**Principal, Maturity and Interest**

The Notes will mature on, 2022 unless redeemed prior thereto as described herein. The redemption
price at maturity will be 100% of the principal amount. The Issuer will issue the Notes in the aggregate principal
amount of £300,000,000. Each Note will bear interest at a rate per annum of % and will be payable semiannually from, 2017, or from the most recent interest payment date to which interest has been paid or
provided for, whichever is later. Interest will be payable on each Note on and of each year,
commencing on, 2017. Interest will be payable to Holders of record on each Note in respect of the
principal amount thereof outstanding as at the immediately preceding or, as the case may be. If
the due date for any payment in respect of the Notes is not a Business Day at the place where such payment is
due to be paid, the Holder thereof will not be entitled to payment of the amount until the next succeeding
Business Day at such place, and will not be entitled to any further interest or other payment as a result of such
delay. The rights of Holders in beneficial interest of the Notes to receive the payments on such Notes are subject
to applicable procedures or Euroclear and/or Clearstream.

Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

From time to time, subject to the Issuer’s compliance with the covenants contained in the Indenture,
including the covenants restricting the incurrence of Debt (as described below under “—Certain Covenants—
_Limitation on Debt”), the Issuer is permitted to issue additional Notes, which shall have terms substantially_
identical to the Notes except in respect of any of the following terms which shall be set forth in an Officer’s
Certificate supplied to the Trustee (the “Additional Notes”):

(a) the title of such Additional Notes;

(b) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Notes;

(c) the date or dates on which such Additional Notes will be issued;

(d) the rate or rates (which may be fixed or floating) at which such Additional Notes shall bear interest
and, if applicable, the interest rate basis, formula or other method of determining such interest rate or
rates, the date or dates from which such interest shall accrue, the interest payment dates on which

101


-----

such interest shall be payable or the method by which such dates will be determined, the record dates
for the determination of Holders thereof to whom such interest is payable and the basis upon which
such interest will be calculated;

(e) the currency or currencies in which such Additional Notes shall be denominated and the currency in
which cash or government obligations in connection with such series of Additional Notes may be
payable;

(f) the date or dates and price or prices at which, the period or periods within which, and the terms and
conditions upon which, such Additional Notes may be redeemed, in whole or in part;

(g) if other than denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof the
denominations in which such Additional Notes shall be issued and redeemed; and

(h) the ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification numbers with respect to such
Additional Notes.

Such Additional Notes will be treated, along with all other series of Notes, as a single class for the purposes
of the Indenture with respect to waivers, amendments and all other matters which are not specifically
distinguished for such series. Unless the context otherwise requires, for all purposes of the Indenture and this
“Description of the Notes,” references to “Notes” shall be deemed to include references to the Initial Notes as
well as any Additional Notes. For all purposes other than U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Notes and any
Additional Notes shall be deemed to form one series, and references to the “Notes” shall be deemed to refer to
the Initial Notes as well as any Additional Notes. In the event that any Additional Notes are not fungible with any
Notes previously issued for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such non-fungible Additional Notes shall be issued
with a separate ISIN, Common Code, CUSIP or other securities identification number, as applicable, so that they
are distinguishable from such previously issued Notes.

**Form of Notes**

The Notes will be issued only in fully registered form without coupons and only in denominations of
£100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

The Notes will be initially in the form of one global Note (the “Global Note”). The Global Note will be
deposited with a common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream or registered in the name of the nominee of
such common depositary. Ownership of interests in the Global Note, referred to in this description as “book-entry
interests,” will be limited to persons that have accounts with Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective
participants. The terms of the Indenture will provide for the issuance of Definitive Registered Notes in certain
circumstances.

See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**Transfer**

The Notes will be subject to certain restrictions on transfer and certification requirements, as described
under “Notice to Investors.”

All transfers of book-entry interests between participants in Euroclear or Clearstream will be effected by
Euroclear or Clearstream pursuant to customary procedures and subject to applicable rules and procedures
established by Euroclear or Clearstream and their respective participants. See “Book-Entry; Delivery and Form.”

**Payments on the Notes; Paying Agent**

The Issuer will make all payments, including principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Notes, at its
office or through agent in London, England that it will maintain for these purposes. Initially, that agent will be
The Bank of New York Mellon, London Branch (the “Paying Agent”). The Issuer may change the Paying Agent
without prior notice to the Holders. In addition, the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries may act as Paying Agent in
connection with the Notes other than for the purposes of effecting a redemption described under “—Optional
_Redemption” or an offer to purchase the Notes described under either of “—Certain Covenants—Change of_
_Control” or “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales.” The Issuer will make all payments in same-day_
funds.

Holders will not be responsible for any service charge for any registration of transfer, exchange or
redemption of the Notes, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or
similar governmental charge payable in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.

102


-----

**Guarantees**

**_General_**

Under the Indenture, the Guarantors will jointly and severally agree to guarantee the due and punctual
payment of all amounts payable under the Notes, including principal, premium, if any, and interest payable under
the Notes.

The obligations of each Guarantor under its Guarantee will be limited to an amount not to exceed the
maximum amount that can be guaranteed by such Guarantor by law or without resulting in its obligations under
its Guarantee being voidable or unenforceable under applicable laws relating to fraudulent transfer, fraudulent
conveyance, corporate benefit or similar laws affecting the rights of creditors generally. Each Guarantor that
makes a payment or distribution under its Guarantee will be entitled to contribution from any other Guarantor.

**_Release of the Guarantees_**

A Guarantee will be automatically and unconditionally released (and thereupon will terminate and be
discharged and be of no further force and effect):

(1) upon the sale or disposition (including through merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other
combination) or conveyance, transfer or lease of the Capital Stock, or all or substantially all of the
assets, of the Guarantor (or a Holding Company thereof) if such sale is made in compliance either
with the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales” or with the
covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets”;

(2) in connection with any sale or other disposition of the Capital Stock of the Guarantor (or Capital
Stock of any Holding Company of such Guarantor (other than the Issuer)) (whether by direct sale or
through a holding company) to a Person that is not (either before or after giving effect to such
transaction) the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer, if the sale or other disposition does
not violate the provisions set forth below under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales”
and as a result of such disposition such Guarantor no longer qualifies as a Subsidiary of the Issuer;

(3) upon a defeasance or satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture that complies with the provisions
under “—Defeasance” or “—Satisfaction and Discharge;”

(4) upon the designation by the Issuer of the Guarantor (or a Holding Company thereof) as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary in compliance with the terms of the Indenture;

(5) upon the liquidation or dissolution of the Guarantor; provided that no Default or Event of Default
has occurred and is continuing;

(6) upon repayment in full of the Notes;

(7) in the case of any Restricted Subsidiary that after the Issue Date is required to guarantee the Notes
pursuant to the covenant described under “—Certain Covenants—Limitation on Guarantees of Debt
_by Restricted Subsidiaries”, the release or discharge of the guarantee of Debt by such Restricted_
Subsidiary which resulted in the obligation to guarantee the Notes; or

(8) as described under “—Amendments and Waivers.”

Upon any occurrence giving rise to a release of a Guarantee as specified above, the Trustee will execute,
subject to the receipt of certain Officer’s Certificates and/or opinions from or on behalf of the Issuer, any
documents reasonably required in order to evidence or effect such release, discharge and termination in respect
of such Guarantee. Neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will be required to make a notation on the Notes to
reflect any such Guarantee or any such release, termination or discharge. Each of the releases and amendments
set forth above shall be effected by the Trustee without any consent of the Holders or any other action or consent
on the part of the Trustee.

**_Limitations on the value of the Guarantees_**

The Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantors on a joint and several basis. The obligations of the Guarantors
under the Guarantees are contractually limited to reflect limitations under applicable law with respect to
maintenance of share capital, corporate benefit, fraudulent conveyance and other legal restrictions applicable to
the Guarantors and their respective shareholders, directors and general partners. For a description of such
limitations, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Notes and the Guarantees—Each Guarantee may be subject

103


-----

_to certain limitations on enforcement and may be limited by applicable laws or subject to certain limitations or_
_defenses_ _that_ _may_ _limits_ _validity_ _and_ _enforceability”_ and “Certain _Insolvency_ _and_ _Enforceability_
_Considerations.”_

**Additional Amounts**

All payments made under or with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees will be made free and clear of and
without withholding or deduction for or on account of any present or future taxes, duties, levies, imposts,
assessments or governmental charges of whatever nature imposed or levied by or on behalf of any jurisdiction in
which the Issuer or any Guarantor is organized, engaged in business, resident for tax purposes, or from or
through which payment on the Notes is made, or any political subdivision or authority thereof or therein, having
the power to tax (each, a “Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction”) and any interest, penalties and other liabilities with
respect thereto (collectively, “Taxes”), unless the withholding or deduction of such Taxes is required by law or
by the authority of a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction’s interpretation or administration thereof. In the event that the
Issuer or a Guarantor is required to so withhold or deduct any amount for or on account of any such Taxes from
any payment made under or with respect to the Notes, the Issuer or Guarantor, as the case may be, will pay such
additional amounts (“Additional Amounts”) as may be necessary so that the net amount received by each Holder
of the Notes (including Additional Amounts) after such withholding or deduction will be not less than the amount
that such Holder would have received if such Taxes had not been required to be withheld or deducted.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor will pay Additional Amounts to a
Holder or beneficial owner of any Note in respect or on account of:

(a) any Taxes that are imposed or levied by a Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction by reason of the Holder’s
(or, if applicable, its partner’s, shareholder’s or beneficial owner’s) present or former connection
with such Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, but not limited to, citizenship, nationality,
residence, domicile, or existence of a business, a permanent establishment, a place of business or a
place of management present or deemed present within the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction) other than
the mere receipt or holding of any Note or by reason of the receipt of payments thereunder or the
exercise or enforcement of rights under such Note, any Guarantee or the Indenture;

(b) any Taxes that are imposed or withheld by reason of the failure of the Holder or beneficial owner of
any Note, prior to the relevant date on which a payment under and with respect to the Notes is due
and payable (the “Relevant Payment Date”), to comply with the Issuer’s written request addressed
to the Holder at least 30 calendar days prior to the Relevant Payment Date to provide accurate
information with respect to any certification, identification, information or other reporting
requirements concerning nationality, residence, identity or connection with the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction which the Holder or such beneficial owner is legally required to satisfy, whether
imposed by statute, treaty, regulation or administrative practice, in each such case by the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction, as a precondition to exemption from, or reduction in the rate of deduction or
withholding of, Taxes imposed by the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including, without limitation, a
certification that the Holder or beneficial owner is not resident in the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction);

(c) any estate, inheritance, gift, sales, personal property or similar Taxes;

(d) any Tax that is payable other than by deduction or withholding from payments made under or with
respect to any Note or Guarantee;

(e) any Tax which would not have been so imposed but for the presentation (where presentation is
required in order to receive payment) by the Holder or beneficial owner of a Note for payment on a
date more than 30 days after the date on which such payment becomes due and payable or the date
on which payment thereof is duly provided for, whichever occurs later, except to the extent that the
Holder or beneficial owner would have been entitled to such Additional Amounts on presenting the
same for payment on any day (including the last day) within such 30-day period;

(f) any Taxes imposed on or with respect to any payment by the Issuer or Guarantor to the Holder if
such Holder is a fiduciary or any person other than the beneficial owner of such payment to the
extent that Taxes would not have been imposed on such payment had such Holder been the
beneficial owner of such Note; or

(g) any withholding or deduction required to be made from a payment pursuant to sections 1471-1474 of
the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), as of the issue date (or any
amended or successor version that is substantively comparable and not materially more onerous to
comply with), any current or future regulations or official interpretations thereof, any similar law or

104


-----

regulation adopted pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement between a non-U.S. jurisdiction and
the United States with respect to the foregoing or any agreements entered into pursuant to
section 1471(b)(1) of the Code.

In addition, Additional Amounts will not be payable with respect to any Taxes that are imposed in respect of
any combination of the above items.

The Issuer or Guarantors will also make or cause to be made such withholding or deduction of Taxes and
remit the full amount of Taxes so deducted or withheld to the relevant taxing authority in accordance with all
applicable laws. The Issuer will, upon request, make available to the Holders, within 30 days after the date on
which the payment of any Taxes so deducted or withheld is due pursuant to applicable law, certified copies of tax
receipts evidencing such payment by the Issuer or if, notwithstanding the Issuer’s reasonable efforts to obtain
such receipts, the same are not obtainable, other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee of such payment
by the Issuer.

At least 30 calendar days prior to each date on which any payment under or with respect to the Notes is due
and payable, if the Issuer or a Guarantor will be obliged to pay Additional Amounts with respect to such payment
(unless such obligation to pay Additional Amounts arises after the 30th day prior to the date on which payment
under or with respect to the Notes is due and payable, in which case it will be promptly thereafter), the Issuer or
Guarantor will deliver to the Trustee and the Paying Agent an Officer’s Certificate stating that such Additional
Amounts will be payable and the amounts so payable and setting forth such other information as is necessary to
enable the Trustee or Paying Agent to pay such Additional Amounts to the Holders and beneficial owners on the
payment date. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to rely solely on such Officer’s Certificate as
conclusive proof that such payments are necessary.

In addition, the Issuer or the Guarantors will pay (i) any present or future stamp, issue, registration, transfer,
documentation, court, excise or property taxes or other similar taxes, charges and duties, including interest,
penalties and Additional Amounts with respect thereto imposed or levied by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction, in
respect of the execution, issue, delivery or registration of the Notes, the Indenture or the Guarantees, or any other
document or instrument referred to thereunder (other than transfers of the Notes following the initial resale of the
Notes by the Initial Purchasers); (ii) any such taxes, charges or duties imposed by any Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction as a result of, or in connection with, the enforcement of the Notes, Guarantees or any other such
document or instrument following the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Notes; and (iii) any
stamp, court or documentary taxes (or similar charges or levies) imposed by any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction
with respect to the receipt of any payments with respect to the Notes or the Guarantees (limited to any such taxes
(or similar charges or levies) that are not excluded under clauses (a) through (c) or (e) through (g) above or any
combination thereof).

The foregoing provisions will survive any termination, defeasance or discharge of the Indenture and will
apply mutatis mutandis to any jurisdiction in which any Surviving Entity (as defined below) or successor person
to the Issuer or a Guarantor is organized, engaged in business, or resident for tax purposes or any political
subdivision or taxing authority or agency thereof or therein.

Whenever in the Indenture or this “Description of the Notes” there is mentioned, in any context, the
payment of principal (and premiums, if any), Redemption Price, interest or any other amount payable under or
with respect to any Note (including payments thereof made pursuant to any Guarantee), such mention will be
deemed to include mention of the payment of Additional Amounts.

**Optional Redemption**

**_General_**

Any redemption and notice of redemption may, at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to the satisfaction of
one or more conditions precedent (including, without limitation, in the case of a redemption related to an Equity
Offering, the consummation of such Equity Offering and, in the case of a redemption of the Notes, the incurrence
of indebtedness the proceeds of which will be used to redeem the Notes). In addition, if such redemption or
notice is subject to satisfaction of one or more conditions precedent, such notice shall state that, in the Issuer’s
discretion, the redemption date may be delayed until such time as any or all such conditions shall be satisfied, or
such redemption may not occur and such notice may be rescinded in the event that any or all such conditions
shall not have been satisfied by the redemption date, or by the redemption date so delayed.

In the case of any partial redemption, unless otherwise required by law, the Notes to be redeemed will be
selected in compliance with the requirements of the principal securities exchange, if any, on which the Notes are

105


-----

listed, and in compliance with the applicable procedures and requirements of the relevant depositary, or, if the
Notes are not listed, and the relevant depositary has no such procedures or requirements, then on a pro rata basis,
by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion will deem to be fair and appropriate, although
no Note of £100,000 in original principal amount or less will be redeemed in part. The Trustee, Paying Agent or
Registrar shall not be liable for any selection made under this paragraph. If any Note is to be redeemed in part
only, the notice of redemption relating to that Note will state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed. A new Note in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued and delivered
in the name of the Holder thereof upon cancellation of the original Note.

Unless the Issuer defaults in the payment of the redemption price, interest will cease to accrue on the Notes
or portion thereof called for redemption on the applicable redemption date. Any such redemption or notice may,
at the Issuer’s discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent.

**_Optional Redemption prior to_** **_, 2019 upon Equity Offering_**

At any time prior to, 2019, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer may on
any one or more occasions redeem up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes at a redemption price
of % of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, with the net
proceeds from one or more Equity Offerings. The Issuer may only do this, however, if:

(a) at least 50% of the aggregate principal amount of Notes that were initially issued (calculated after
giving effect to the issuance of any Additional Notes) would remain outstanding immediately after
the proposed redemption; and

(b) the redemption occurs within 90 days after the closing of such Equity Offering.

**_Optional Redemption prior to_** **_, 2019_**

At any time prior to, 2019, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice, the Issuer may also
redeem all or part of the Notes at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof plus the
Applicable Redemption Premium and accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.

**_Optional Redemption on or after_** **_, 2019_**

At any time on or after, 2019 and prior to maturity, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’
notice, the Issuer may redeem all or part of the Notes. These redemptions will be in amounts of £100,000 or
integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of
their principal amount at maturity), plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the redemption date, if redeemed
during the 12-month period commencing on of the years set forth below.

**_Redemption Upon Changes in Withholding Taxes_**

The Issuer may, at its option, redeem the Notes, in whole but not in part, at any time upon giving not less
than 10 nor more than 60 days’ notice to the Holders, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount thereof, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon, if any, to the redemption date and all
Additional Amounts, if any, then due and which will become due on the date of redemption as a result of the
redemption or otherwise, if the Issuer determines in good faith that the Issuer or any Guarantor is or, on the next
date on which any amount would be payable in respect of the Notes, would be obliged to pay Additional
Amounts (as defined above under “—Additional Amounts”) which are more than a de minimis amount in respect
of the Notes or the Guarantees pursuant to the terms and conditions thereof, which the Issuer or Guarantor cannot
avoid by the use of reasonable measures available to it (including making payment through a Paying Agent
located in another jurisdiction and, in the case of the Guarantor, only if the payment giving rise to such
requirement cannot be made by the Issuer or another Guarantor without the obligation to pay Additional
Amounts), as a result of:

(a) any change in, or amendment to, the laws (or any regulations or rulings promulgated thereunder) of
any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (as defined above under “—Additional Amounts”) affecting

106


-----

taxation which becomes effective on or after the date of the Indenture or, if the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction has changed since the date of the Indenture, on or after the date on which the then
current Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture;
or

(b) any change in the official application, administration, or interpretation of the laws, treaties,
regulations or rulings of any Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction (including a holding, judgment or order by
a court of competent jurisdiction) on or after the date of the Indenture or, if the Relevant Taxing
Jurisdiction has changed since the date of the Indenture, on or after the date on which the then
current Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction became the Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture
(each of the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), a “Change in Tax Law”).

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer may not redeem the Notes under this provision if the Relevant
Taxing Jurisdiction changes under the Indenture and the Issuer is obliged to pay Additional Amounts as a result
of a Change in Tax Law of the then current Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction which, at the time the latter became the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction under the Indenture, had been publicly announced as being or having been formally
proposed.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such notice of redemption will be given (a) earlier than 60 days prior to
the earliest date on which the Issuer or Guarantor would be obliged to make such payment of Additional
Amounts or withholding if a payment in respect of the Notes were then due and (b) unless at the time such notice
is given, the obligation to pay Additional Amounts remains in effect.

Prior to the publication or, where relevant, mailing of any notice of redemption pursuant to the foregoing,
the Issuer will deliver to the Trustee:

(a) an Officer’s Certificate stating that the Issuer is entitled to effect such redemption and setting forth a
statement of facts showing that the conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to so redeem have
occurred (including that such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts cannot be avoided by the
Issuer or Guarantor taking reasonable measures available to it); and

(b) an opinion of independent tax counsel of recognized standing, qualified under the laws of the
Relevant Taxing Jurisdiction and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee to the effect that the Issuer or
Guarantor, as the case may be, is or would be obliged to pay such Additional Amounts as a result of
a Change in Tax Law.

The Trustee will accept such Officer’s Certificate and opinion as sufficient evidence of the satisfaction of
the conditions precedent as described above, in which event it will be conclusive and binding on the Holders.

The foregoing provisions will apply mutatis mutandis to any successor person, after such successor person
becomes a party to the Indenture, with respect to a Change in Tax Law occurring after the time such successor
person becomes a party to the Indenture.

**_Notice of Optional Redemption_**

If the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require, the
Issuer will inform the Exchange of the principal amount of the Notes that have not been redeemed in connection
with any optional redemption. If fewer than all the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, the Notes will be
selected in accordance with the methods described “—Optional Redemption—General.”

**Mandatory Redemption; Offers to Purchase; Open Market Purchases**

The Issuer will not be required to make any mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to
the Notes. However, under certain circumstances, the Issuer may be required to offer to purchase the Notes as
described under the captions “—Certain _Covenants—Change_ _of_ _Control”_ and “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Asset Sales.” The Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries may at any time and from_
time to time purchase Notes in the open market or otherwise.

**Certain Covenants**

The Indenture will contain, among others, the following covenants.

**_Limitation on Debt_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, issue, incur, assume,
guarantee or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable with respect to or otherwise become

107


-----

responsible for, contingently or otherwise, the payment of (individually and collectively, to “Incur”
or, as appropriate, an “Incurrence”), any Debt (including any Acquired Debt); provided that the
Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary will be permitted to Incur Debt (including Acquired Debt) if, at
the time of such Incurrence and after giving effect to the Incurrence of such Debt and the application
of the proceeds thereof, on a pro forma basis, the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would not be greater
than 4.00 to 1.00; and

(2) This “Limitation on Debt” covenant will not, however, prohibit the following (collectively,
“Permitted Debt”):

(a) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt under Credit Facilities in an
aggregate principal amount at any one time outstanding not to exceed (i) £895.0 million plus
(ii) in the case of any refinancing of any Debt permitted under this clause, the aggregate
amount of fees, underwriting discounts, premiums and other costs and expenses incurred in
connection with such refinancing;

(b) the Incurrence by the Issuer of Debt pursuant to the Notes (other than Additional Notes) and
the Incurrence of Debt by the Guarantors pursuant to the Guarantees (other than Guarantees of
Additional Notes);

(c) any Debt of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary outstanding on the Issue Date (other than
Debt described in clauses (a) or (b) of this paragraph (2));

(d) the Incurrence by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of intercompany Debt between the
Issuer and any Restricted Subsidiary or between or among Restricted Subsidiaries; provided
that:

(i) if the Issuer or a Guarantor is the obligor on any such Debt and the lender of such Debt
is not the Issuer or a Guarantor, it is unsecured and expressly subordinated in right of
payment to the prior payment in full in cash (whether upon Stated Maturity, acceleration
or otherwise) and the performance in full of its obligations under the Notes or its
Guarantee, as the case may be; and

(ii) (x) any disposition, pledge or transfer of any such Debt to any Person (other than a
disposition, pledge or transfer to the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary) and (y) any
transaction pursuant to which any Restricted Subsidiary that has Debt owing from the
Issuer or another Restricted Subsidiary ceases to be a Restricted Subsidiary, will, in each
case, be deemed to be an Incurrence of such Debt not permitted by this clause (d);

(e) (i) guarantees by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary of Debt of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary, in each case so long as the Incurrence of such Debt is permitted
under the terms of the Indenture; or

(3) For purposes of determining compliance with this “Limitation on Debt” covenant, in the event that an
item of Debt meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of Permitted Debt described in
clauses (a) through (y) of paragraph (2) above, or is entitled to be Incurred pursuant to paragraph (1) of
this “Limitation on Debt” covenant, the Issuer will be permitted to classify such item of Debt on the
date of its Incurrence in any manner that complies with this “Limitation on Debt” covenant. Debt under
Credit Facilities outstanding on the date on which the Notes are first issued will initially be deemed to
have been Incurred on such date in reliance on the exception provided by clause (a) of paragraph
(2) above. In addition, any item of Debt initially classified as Incurred pursuant to one of the categories
of Permitted Debt described in clauses (b) through (y) of paragraph (2) above, or entitled to be Incurred
pursuant to paragraph (1) of this “Limitation on Debt” covenant, may later be reclassified by the Issuer
such that it will be deemed as having been Incurred pursuant to such new clause or paragraph (1) of
this “Limitation on Debt” covenant to the extent that such reclassified Debt could be Incurred pursuant
to such new clause or paragraph (1) of this “Limitation on Debt” covenant at the time of such
reclassification. Debt permitted by this covenant need not be permitted solely by reference to one
provision permitting such Debt but may be permitted in part by one such provision and in part by one
or more other provisions of this covenant permitting such Debt.

(4) For purposes of determining compliance with any restriction on the Incurrence of Debt in Sterling
where Debt is denominated in a different currency, the amount of such Debt will be the Sterling
Equivalent determined on the date of such determination; provided that if any such Debt
denominated in a different currency is subject to a Currency Agreement (with respect to Sterling)
covering principal amounts payable on such Debt, the amount of such Debt expressed in Sterling
will be adjusted to take into account the effect of such agreement. The principal amount of any
Permitted Refinancing Debt Incurred in the same currency as the Debt being refinanced will be the
Sterling Equivalent of the Debt being refinanced determined on the date such Debt being refinanced
was initially Incurred. Notwithstanding any other provision of this “Limitation on Debt” covenant,
for purposes of determining compliance with this “Limitation on Debt” covenant, increases in Debt
solely due to fluctuations in the exchange rates of currencies will not be deemed to exceed the
maximum amount that the Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary may Incur under the “Limitation on
_Debt” covenant._

(5) For purposes of determining any particular amount of Debt under the “Limitation on Debt”
covenant:

(a) obligations in the form of letters of credit, guarantees or Liens, in each case supporting Debt
otherwise included in the determination of such particular amount will not be included;

(b) any Liens granted pursuant to the equal and ratable provisions referred to in the “Limitation on
_Liens” covenant will not be treated as Debt; and_

(c) accrual of interest, accrual of dividends, the accretion or amortization of original issue
discount or of accreted value, the obligation to pay commitment fees and the payment of
interest or dividends in the form of additional Debt, will not, in any case, be treated as Debt.

guarantee upon the full and unconditional release of such guarantee and (z) in the case

sale, purchase, exchange or lease of assets or property or the rendering of any service), with, or for
the benefit of, any Affiliate of the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary having a value greater

(a) such transaction or series of transactions is on terms that, taken as a whole, are not materially
less favorable to the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, than those that
could have been obtained in a comparable arm’s-length transaction with third parties that are

or the transfer of assets or the provision of services, in each case having a value greater than
£20.0 million, the Issuer will deliver a resolution of its Board of Directors (attached to an

Financial Advisor stating that the transaction or series of transactions is fair to the Issuer or
such Restricted Subsidiary from a financial point of view or that the terms are not materially
less favorable to the Issuer or its relevant Restricted Subsidiary than those that would have
been obtained in a comparable transaction by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary with an
unrelated Person on an arm’s length basis.

(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this description will not apply to:

(i) customary directors’ fees, indemnities and similar arrangements (including the payment of
directors’ and officers’ insurance premiums), consulting and advisory fees, employee

respect thereto;

(iv) agreements and arrangements existing on the Issue Date and any amendment, extension,

Restricted Subsidiaries, as applicable, in any material respect than the original agreement or
arrangement as in effect on the Issue Date;

(v) the issuance of securities or other payments, awards or grants in cash, securities or similar

obligations under the terms of, any stockholders agreement (including any registration rights

existence of, or the performance by the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries of,
obligations under any future amendment to any such existing agreement or under any similar
agreement entered into after the Issue Date shall only be permitted by this clause (ix) to the
extent that the terms of any such amendment or new agreement are not otherwise
disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes when taken as a whole;

(x) transactions with a Person that is an Affiliate of the Issuer solely because the Issuer or a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer owns Capital Stock in such Person or solely because the
Issuer or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Issuer has the right to designate one or more members

(xi) transactions with customers, clients, suppliers or purchasers or sellers of goods or services, in
each case in the ordinary course of business, which are fair to the Issuer or the relevant
Restricted Subsidiary in the reasonable determination of the Board of Directors or an officer of
the Issuer or the relevant Restricted Subsidiary or are on terms no less favorable than those
that could reasonably have been obtained at such time from an unaffiliated party.

incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien of any kind or assign or otherwise convey any right to
receive any income, profits or proceeds on or with respect to any of the Issuer’s or any Restricted
Subsidiary’s property or assets, including any shares or stock or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary,
whether owned at or acquired after the Issue Date, or any income, profits or proceeds therefrom

(a) in the case of any Lien securing Subordinated Debt, the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the
Notes, the obligations of the Guarantors under the Guarantees and all other amounts due under

is no longer secured by a Lien; and

(b) in the case of any other Lien, the Issuer’s obligations in respect of the Notes, the obligations of
the Guarantors under the Guarantees and all other amounts due under the Indenture are equally
and ratably secured with the obligation or liability secured by such Lien.

(2) Any such Lien arising as a result of paragraphs (1)(a) or (b) above will be automatically and
unconditionally released and discharged concurrently with the unconditional release of the Lien
which gave rise to such Lien (other than as a consequence of an enforcement action with respect to
the assets subject to such Lien).

(1) If a Change of Control occurs at any time, the Issuer will make an offer (a “Change of Control
**Offer”) to each Holder of Notes to purchase such Holder’s Notes, in whole or in part, in a principal**

**Date”).**

accrue interest after the Change of Control Purchase Date unless the Change of Control
Purchase Price is not paid on such date;

(f) any other procedures that a Holder of Notes must follow to accept a Change of Control Offer
or to withdraw such acceptance.

(3) Upon receipt by the Trustee from the Issuer of an Officer’s Certificate stating the aggregate principal

Trustee will promptly authenticate and deliver a new Note or Notes in a principal amount equal to
any unpurchased portion of Notes surrendered, if any, to the Holder of Notes in global form or to
each Holder of certificated Notes; provided that each such new Note will be in a principal amount of
£100,000 or in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof. The Issuer will publicly announce the
results of a Change of Control Offer on or as soon as practicable after the Change of Control
Purchase Date.

(4) The Issuer will not be required to make a Change of Control Offer following a Change of Control if
(i) the Notes have been irrevocably and unconditionally called for redemption as described under
“—Optional Redemption” or (ii) a third party has made, and not terminated, a tender offer for all of
the Notes in the manner and at the times applicable to a Change of Control Offer, at a tender offer
purchase price in cash equal to at least 101% of the principal amount thereof on the date of purchase,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and such third party purchases all of the Notes validly
tendered and not withdrawn under such tender offer.

The Issuer and the Guarantors will comply with the applicable tender offer rules, including
Rule 14e-l under the Exchange Act, and any other applicable securities laws and regulations in
connection with a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws
or regulations conflict with provisions of the Indenture, the Issuer and the Guarantors will comply
with such applicable securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached their
obligations under the Indenture by virtue of such conflict.

If and for so long as the Notes are listed on the Exchange and the rules of the Exchange so require,
the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any Change of Control Offer.

The occurrence of certain events that would constitute a Change of Control could constitute a default
under the Existing Credit Facilities. The Issuer’s future debt and the future debt of its Subsidiaries
may also contain provisions that, if certain events occur, would require such debt to be repurchased.
In addition, the exercise by the holders of the Notes of their right to require a repurchase of the Notes
upon a Change of Control could cause a default under the Existing Credit Facilities and any such
future debt, even if the Change of Control itself does not, due to the possible financial effect on the
Issuer or the Guarantors of such repurchase.

116


-----

Not all business combinations or acquisitions of us by third parties would necessarily result in a
Change of Control and may not result in a Change of Control Offer to holders of the Notes. The
provisions of the Indenture will not give Holders the right to require the repurchase of the Notes in
the event of certain transactions including a reorganization, restructuring, merger or similar
transaction that may adversely affect Holders of the Notes, if such transaction is not a transaction
defined as a Change of Control. Any such transaction, however, would have to comply with the
applicable provisions of the Indenture, including those described under “—Certain
_Covenants—Limitation on Debt.” The existence, however, of a Holder of the Notes’ right to require_
the Issuer to repurchase such Holder’s Notes upon a Change of Control may deter a third party from
acquiring the Issuer or any of its Subsidiaries if such acquisition would constitute a Change of
Control.

If a Change of Control Offer is made, the Issuer will not be able to provide any assurance that it will
have available funds sufficient to pay the Change of Control Purchase Price for all the Notes that
might be delivered by holders of the Notes seeking to accept the Change of Control Offer. Even if
sufficient funds were available, the terms of any other debt of the Issuer and its Subsidiaries may
prohibit the repurchase of the Notes prior to their scheduled maturity. If the Issuer were not able to
prepay any debt containing any such restrictions, or obtain requisite consents, the Issuer would be
unable to fulfill its repurchase obligations to holders of Notes who accept the Change of Control
Offer. If a Change of Control Offer was not made or consummated or the Change of Control
Purchase Price was not paid when due, such failure would result in an Event of Default and would
give the Trustee and the holders of the Notes the rights described under “—Events of Default.” An
Event of Default under the Indenture, unless waived, would result in a cross-default under certain of
the financing arrangements described under “Description of Other Indebtedness,” including under
the Existing Credit Facilities.

If Holders of not less than 90% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes validly
tender and do not withdraw such Notes in a Change of Control Offer and the Issuer, or any third
party making a Change of Control Offer in lieu of the Issuer as described above, purchases all of the
Notes validly tendered and not withdrawn by such holders, the Issuer or such third party will have
the right, upon not less than 10 nor more than 60 days’ prior notice (provided that such notice is
given not more than 10 days following such purchase pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
described above) to redeem all Notes that remain outstanding following such purchase at a price in
cash equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof on the redemption date plus accrued and unpaid
interest (if any) to but not including the redemption date (subject to the right of holders of record on
the relevant record date to receive interest due on the relevant interest payment date).

The definition of “Change of Control” includes a disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of
the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries to any Person. Although there is a limited body of case law
interpreting the phrase “substantially all,” there is no precise established definition of such phrase
under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain circumstances, there may be a degree of uncertainty as
to whether a particular transaction would involve a disposition of “all or substantially all” of the
assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries. As a result, it may be unclear as to whether a
Change of Control has occurred and whether a Holder of Notes may require the Issuer to make an
offer to repurchase the Notes as described above.

The provisions of the Indenture relating to the Issuer’s obligation to make an offer to repurchase the
Notes following a Change of Control may be waived or modified with the prior written consent of
the Holders of a majority in principal amount of the Notes. See “—Amendments and Waivers”
below.

**_Limitation on Asset Sales_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, consummate any Asset Sale
unless:

(a) the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives for such Asset Sale is not
less than the Fair Market Value of the assets sold (as determined by the Issuer’s Board of
Directors);

117


-----

(b) at least 75% of the consideration the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary receives in respect of
such Asset Sale consists of:

(i) cash (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to cash within 180
days of such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received in
consideration of such Asset Sale);

(ii) Cash Equivalents (including any Net Cash Proceeds received from the conversion to
cash within 180 days of such Asset Sale of securities, notes or other obligations received
in consideration of such Asset Sale);

(iii) the assumption by the purchaser of (x) the Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted
Subsidiary (other than Subordinated Debt) as a result of which neither the Issuer nor any
of the Restricted Subsidiaries remains obliged in respect of such Debt or (y) Debt of a
Restricted Subsidiary that is no longer a Restricted Subsidiary as a result of such Asset
Sale, if the Issuer and each other Restricted Subsidiary is released from any guarantee of
such Debt as a result of such Asset Sale;

(iv) Replacement Assets;

(v) any Designated Non-cash Consideration received by the Issuer or any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale; provided that the aggregate Fair Market Value of such
Designated Non-cash Consideration, taken together with the Fair Market Value at the
time of receipt of all other Designated Non-cash Consideration received pursuant to this
clause (v), less the amount of Net Proceeds previously realized in cash from prior
Designated Non-cash Consideration does not exceed (with the Fair Market Value of
each item of Designated Non- cash Consideration being measured at the time received
and without giving effect to subsequent changes in value) the greater of £25.0 million
and 8.4% of Consolidated EBITDA; or

(vi) a combination of the consideration specified in clauses (i) through (v); and

(c) the Issuer delivers an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee certifying that such Asset Sale
complies with the provisions described in the foregoing clauses (a) and (b).

(2) If the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary consummates an Asset Sale, the Net Cash Proceeds of the
Asset Sale, within 365 days of the consummation of such Asset Sale (or the Issuer or any such
Restricted Subsidiary may enter into a binding commitment to so use; provided that such Net Cash
Proceeds are so used within 180 days after the expiration of the aforementioned 365 day period),
may be used by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) permanently repay or prepay any then outstanding Debt of the Issuer, or Debt of any
Restricted Subsidiary (and to permanently reduce the corresponding commitment by an equal
amount if such Debt is a revolving credit borrowing) owing to a Person other than the Issuer or
a Restricted Subsidiary, as applicable;

(b) to make a capital expenditure or to invest in any Replacement Assets; or

(c) any combination of the foregoing.

The amount of such Net Cash Proceeds not so used as set forth in this paragraph (2) constitutes
“Excess Proceeds.” Pending the final application of any such Net Cash Proceeds, the Issuer may
temporarily reduce revolving credit borrowings or otherwise invest such Net Cash Proceeds in any
manner that is not prohibited by the terms of the Indenture.

(3) When the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds exceeds £30.0 million, the Issuer will, within
30 Business Days, make an offer to purchase (an “Excess Proceeds Offer”) from all holders of
Notes and, at the Issuer’s election, from the holders of any Pari Passu Debt, to the extent required by
the terms thereof, on a pro rata basis, in accordance with the procedures set forth in the Indenture or
the agreements governing any such Pari Passu Debt, the maximum principal amount, in the case of
the Notes (expressed as a minimum amount of £100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess
thereof) of the Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt that may be purchased with the amount of the
Excess Proceeds. The offer price as to each Note and any such Pari Passu Debt will be payable in
cash in an amount equal to (solely in the case of the Notes) 100% of the principal amount of such

118


-----

Note and (solely in the case of Pari Passu Debt) no greater than 100% of the principal amount (or
accreted value, as applicable) of such Pari Passu Debt, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, to the date of purchase.

To the extent that the aggregate principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt tendered
pursuant to an Excess Proceeds Offer is less than the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the
Issuer may use the amount of such Excess Proceeds not used to purchase Notes and Pari Passu Debt
for general corporate purposes that are not otherwise prohibited by the Indenture. If the aggregate
principal amount of Notes and any such Pari Passu Debt validly tendered and not withdrawn by
holders thereof exceeds the aggregate amount of Excess Proceeds, the Notes and any such Pari
_Passu Debt to be purchased will be allocated on a pro rata basis (based upon the principal amount of_
Notes and the principal amount or accreted value of such Pari Passu Debt tendered by each holder).
Upon completion of each such Excess Proceeds Offer, the amount of Excess Proceeds will be reset
to zero.

(4) If the Issuer is obliged to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will purchase the Notes and
_Pari Passu Debt, at the option of the holders thereof, in whole or in part in a minimum amount of_
£100,000 and integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof on a date that is not earlier than 30 days
and not later than 60 days from the date the notice of the Excess Proceeds Offer is given to such
Holders, or such later date as may be required under the Exchange Act.

Pending the final application of any Net Proceeds, the Issuer may temporarily reduce revolving
credit borrowings or otherwise invest the Net Proceeds in any manner that is not prohibited by the
Indenture.

If the Issuer is required to make an Excess Proceeds Offer, the Issuer will comply with the applicable
tender offer rules, including Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other applicable securities
laws and regulations, including the requirements of any applicable securities exchange on which
Notes are then listed. To the extent that the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict
with the provisions of this “Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant, the Issuer will comply with such
securities laws and regulations and will not be deemed to have breached its obligations described in
this “Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant by virtue thereof.

**_Limitation on Guarantees of Debt by Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor, directly or indirectly, to
guarantee, assume or in any other manner become liable for the payment of any Debt outstanding
under any Credit Facility incurred under clause 2(a) of the covenant described under “—Limitation
_on Debt” or any other Public Debt of the Issuer or any Guarantor (other than the Notes), unless such_
Restricted Subsidiary executes and delivers within 30 days a supplemental indenture to the Indenture
providing for a Guarantee of payment of the Notes by such Restricted Subsidiary on the same terms
as the guarantee of such other Debt; and with respect to any guarantee of Subordinated Debt by such
Restricted Subsidiary, any such guarantee shall be subordinated to such Restricted Subsidiary’s
Guarantee with respect to the Notes at least to the same extent as such Subordinated Debt is
subordinated to the Notes. Any Guarantee of payment of the Notes may contain limitations on
Guarantor liability to the extent reasonably necessary to recognize certain defenses generally
available to guarantors or other considerations under applicable law or regulation.

(2) The provisions of the preceding paragraph will not be applicable to any guarantee of any Restricted
Subsidiary existing on the Issue Date or that existed at the time such Person became a Restricted
Subsidiary if the guarantee was not Incurred in connection with, or in contemplation of, such Person
becoming a Restricted Subsidiary.

(3) Any Guarantee of the Notes granted pursuant to the provisions described in the first paragraph of
this covenant may provide by its terms that it will be automatically and unconditionally released and
discharged the release of the Guarantees on the terms and conditions and in the circumstances
described under the heading “—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees.” A Guarantee of a future
Guarantor may also be released at the option of the Issuer if at the date of such release there is no
Debt of such Guarantor outstanding which was Incurred after the Issue Date and which could not
have been Incurred in compliance with the Indenture as at the date of such release if such Guarantor
were not designated as a Guarantor as at that date. The Trustee shall take all necessary actions to
effectuate any release of a Note Guarantee in accordance with these provisions, subject to customary
protections and indemnifications.

119


-----

(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will not be obligated to cause such Restricted Subsidiary
to guarantee the Notes to the extent such Guarantee would reasonably be expected to give rise to or
result in (a) any conflict with or violation of applicable law; (b) any risk of personal liability for the
officers, directors, shareholders or partners of such Restricted Subsidiary; or (c) any cost, expense,
liability or obligation (including with respect to any Taxes but excluding any reasonable guarantee or
similar fee payable to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary) other than reasonable expenses and
other than reasonable governmental expenses incurred in connection with any governmental or
regulatory filings required as a result of, or any measures pursuant to the first paragraph of this
covenant undertaken in connection with, such Guarantee.

**_Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(1) The Issuer will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or
otherwise cause or suffer to exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction of
any kind on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to:

(a) pay dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on or in respect of its
Capital Stock or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits;

(b) pay any Debt owed to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary;

(c) make loans or advances to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary; or

(d) transfer any of its properties or assets to the Issuer or any other Restricted Subsidiary,

provided that (i) the priority of any Preferred Stock in receiving dividends or liquidating
distributions prior to dividends or liquidating distributions being paid on common stock and (ii) the
subordination of (including the application of any standstill requirements to) loans or advances made
to the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary to other Debt Incurred by the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary shall not be deemed to constitute such an encumbrance or restriction.

(2) The provisions of the “Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted
_Subsidiaries” covenant described in paragraph (1) above will not apply to:_

(a) encumbrances and restrictions imposed by the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees or the
Existing Credit Facilities;

(b) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by Debt permitted to be Incurred under Credit Facilities
or any guarantee thereof in accordance with the “Limitation on Debt” covenant or pursuant to
paragraph (2) of such “Limitation on Debt” covenant; provided that in the case of any such
encumbrances or restrictions imposed under any Credit Facilities, such encumbrances or
restrictions taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the Holders taken as a whole
than those imposed by the Existing Credit Facilities as at the Issue Date;

(c) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement in effect on the Issue Date (other
than an agreement described in another clause of this paragraph (2));

(d) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above, encumbrances
and restrictions: (i) that restrict in a customary manner the subletting, assignment or transfer of
any properties or assets that are subject to a lease, license, conveyance or other similar
agreement to which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party; and (ii) contained in
operating leases for real property and restricting only the transfer of such real property upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of a default in the payment of rent;

(e) encumbrances or restrictions contained in any agreement or other instrument of a Person or
relating to assets acquired by the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary in effect at the time of
such acquisition (but not created in contemplation thereof), which encumbrance or restriction
is not applicable to any Person, or the properties or assets of any Person, other than the Person,
or the property or assets of the Person, so acquired;

(f) encumbrances or restrictions contained in contracts for sales of Capital Stock or assets
permitted by the “Limitation on Asset Sales” covenant with respect to the assets or Capital
Stock to be sold pursuant to such contract or in customary merger or acquisition agreements
(or any option to enter into such contract) for the purchase or acquisition of Capital Stock or
assets or any of the Issuer’s Subsidiaries by another Person;

120


-----

(g) encumbrances or restrictions imposed by applicable law or regulation or by governmental
licenses, concessions, franchises or permits;

(h) encumbrances or restrictions on cash or other deposits or net worth imposed by customers
under contracts entered into the ordinary course of business;

(i) customary limitations on the distribution or disposition of assets or property of a Restricted
Subsidiary in joint venture agreements entered into the ordinary course of business and in
good faith; provided that such encumbrance or restriction is applicable only to such Restricted
Subsidiary; provided further, that:

(i) the encumbrance or restriction is not materially less favorable to the Holders taken as a
whole than is customary in comparable agreements (as determined in good faith by the
Issuer); and

(ii) the Issuer determines in good faith that any such encumbrance or restriction will not
materially affect the ability of the Issuer or any Guarantor to make any principal or
interest payments on the Notes;

(j) in the case of clause 1(d) above, customary encumbrances or restrictions in connection with
purchase money obligations, mortgage financings and Capitalized Lease Obligations for
property acquired in the ordinary course of business;

(k) any encumbrance or restriction arising by reason of customary non-assignment provisions in
agreements;

(l) any encumbrance or restriction arising pursuant to an agreement or instrument relating to any
Debt permitted to be Incurred after the Issue Date pursuant to the provisions of the covenant
described under “—Limitation on Debt:” (i) if the encumbrances and restrictions contained in
any such agreement or instrument taken as a whole are not materially less favorable to the
Holders taken as a whole than the encumbrances and restrictions contained in the Indenture (as
determined in good faith by the Issuer); or (ii) if such encumbrance or restriction is not
materially more disadvantageous to the holders of the Notes than is customary in comparable
financings (as determined in good faith by the Issuer);

(m) any encumbrances or restrictions imposed by any amendments, modifications, restatements,
renewals, extensions, increases, supplements, refundings, replacements or refinancings of the
contracts, instruments or obligations referred to in clauses (a) and (l) of this paragraph (2); provided
that such amendments, modifications, restatements, renewals, extension, increases, supplements,
refundings, replacements or refinancings are, in the good faith judgment of the Issuer’s Board of
Directors, no more restrictive (taken as a whole) with respect to such encumbrances or restrictions
than those contained in the encumbrances or restrictions prior to such amendment, modification,
restatement, renewal, extension, increase, supplement, refunding, replacement or refinancing; or

(n) with respect to restrictions or encumbrances referred to in clause (1)(d) above, encumbrances
or restrictions existing by reason of any Lien permitted under “—Limitation on Liens.”

**_Designation of Unrestricted and Restricted Subsidiaries_**

(i) The Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Subsidiary (including newly acquired or newly
established Subsidiaries) to be an “Unrestricted Subsidiary” only if:

(a) no Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of or after giving effect to such
designation;

(b) the Issuer would be permitted to make an Investment at the time of designation (assuming the
effectiveness of such designation) pursuant to the “Limitation on Restricted Payments”
covenant in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net book value of the Issuer’s interest in
such Subsidiary calculated in accordance with IFRS or (ii) the Fair Market Value of the
Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary;

(c) the Issuer would be permitted under the Indenture to Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt
pursuant to the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the “Limitation on Debt” covenant at the time
of such designation (assuming the effectiveness of such designation);

(d) such Subsidiary is not liable, directly or indirectly, with respect to any Debt, Lien or other
obligation that, if in default, would result (with the passage of time or giving of notice or

121


-----

otherwise) in a default on any of the Issuer’s Debt or Debt of any Restricted Subsidiary;
_provided that an Unrestricted Subsidiary may provide a Guarantee for the Notes;_

(e) such Subsidiary, either alone or in the aggregate with all other Unrestricted Subsidiaries, does
not operate, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of the businesses of the Issuer and its
Subsidiaries; and

(f) such Subsidiary is a Person with respect to which neither the Issuer nor any Restricted
Subsidiary has any direct or indirect obligation to:

(i) subscribe for additional Capital Stock of such Person; or

(ii) maintain or preserve such Person’s financial condition or to cause such Person to
achieve any specified levels of operating results.

(ii) In the event of any such designation, the Issuer will be deemed to have made an Investment
constituting a Restricted Payment pursuant to the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant for
all purposes of the Indenture in an amount equal to the greater of (i) the net book value of the
Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary calculated in accordance with IFRS or (ii) the Fair Market Value
of the Issuer’s interest in such Subsidiary.

(iii) The Indenture will further provide that neither the Issuer nor any Restricted Subsidiary will at any
time:

(a) provide a guarantee of, or similar credit support to, any Debt of any Unrestricted Subsidiary
(including of any undertaking, agreement or instrument evidencing such Debt); provided that
the Issuer may pledge Capital Stock or Debt of any Unrestricted Subsidiary on a non-recourse
basis as long as the pledgee has no claim whatsoever against the Issuer other than to obtain
such pledged property, except to the extent permitted under the “Limitation on Restricted
_Payments” and “Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates” covenants;_

(b) be directly or indirectly liable for any Debt of any Unrestricted Subsidiary, except to the extent
permitted under the “Limitation on Restricted Payments” and “Limitation on Transactions
_with Affiliates” covenants; or_

(c) be directly or indirectly liable for any other Debt that provides that the holder thereof may
(upon giving notice, the lapse of time or both) declare a default thereof (or cause the payment
thereof to be accelerated or payable prior to its final scheduled maturity) upon the occurrence
of a default with respect to any other Debt that is Debt of an Unrestricted Subsidiary
(including any corresponding right to take enforcement action against such Unrestricted
Subsidiary).

(iv) The Issuer’s Board of Directors may designate any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted
Subsidiary:

(a) if no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing at the time of, or will occur
and be continuing after giving effect to, such designation; and

(b) unless such designated Unrestricted Subsidiary shall not have any Debt outstanding (other
than Debt that would be Permitted Debt), immediately before and after giving effect to such
proposed designation, and after giving pro forma effect to the Incurrence of any such Debt of
such designated Unrestricted Subsidiary as if such Debt was Incurred on the date of its
designation as a Restricted Subsidiary, the Issuer could Incur at least £1.00 of additional Debt
pursuant to the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the “Limitation on Debt” covenant.

(v) Any such designation as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or Restricted Subsidiary by the Issuer’s Board of
Directors will be evidenced to the Trustee by filing a resolution of the Issuer’s Board of Directors
with the Trustee giving effect to such designation and an Officer’s Certificate certifying that such
designation complies with the foregoing conditions, and giving the effective date of such
designation. Any such filing with the Trustee must occur within 45 days after the end of the Issuer’s
fiscal quarter in which such designation is made (or, in the case of a designation made during the last
fiscal quarter of the Issuer’s fiscal year, within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

122


-----

**_Reports to Holders_**

(i) So long as any Notes are outstanding, the Issuer will furnish to the Trustee:

(a) annual reports containing, to the extent applicable, the following information: (a) audited
consolidated balance sheets of the Issuer as of the end of the two most recent fiscal years and
audited consolidated income statements and statements of cash flow of the Issuer for the two
most recent fiscal years, including complete footnotes to such financial statements and the
report of the independent auditors on the financial statements; (b) an operating and financial
review of the audited financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations,
financial condition, and liquidity and capital resources of the Issuer; (c) a description of the
business of the Issuer; and (d) a description of management and shareholders, material debt
instruments, material affiliate transactions, material risk factors and material subsequent
events all in substantially the same form as presented in the Offering Memorandum, within
120 days following the end of each fiscal year; provided that the information in clause (d) may
be provided in the footnotes to the audited financial statements.

(b) semi-annual financial information of the Issuer as of and for the period from the beginning of
each year to the close of the first half period, together with comparable information for the
corresponding period of the preceding year, and an operating and financial review of the
financial statements, including a discussion of the results of operations, financial condition,
and material changes in liquidity and financial resources of the Issuer within 90 days
following the end of the fiscal half; and

(c) promptly after the occurrence of a material acquisition, disposition or restructuring, any
change of the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer of the Issuer or a change
in auditors of the Issuer or any other material event, a report containing a description of such
event.

(ii) No report need include separate financial statements for any Guarantors or non-Guarantor
Subsidiaries of the Issuer or any disclosure with respect to the results of operations or any other
financial or statistical disclosure not of a type included in this Offering Memorandum.

(iii) At any time that any of the Issuer’s subsidiaries are Unrestricted Subsidiaries and any such
Unrestricted Subsidiary or a group of Unrestricted Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, constitutes a
Significant Subsidiary of the Issuer, then the semi-annual and annual financial information required
by the first paragraph of this “Reports to Holders” covenant will include a reasonably detailed
presentation, either on the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto, of the financial
condition and results of operations of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries separate from the
financial condition and results of operations of the Unrestricted Subsidiaries of the Issuer.

(iv) The Issuer will furnish to the Trustee such other information that is required to make publicly
available under the requirements of the London Stock Exchange as a result of having its ordinary
shares admitted for trading on such exchange. Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this covenant,
upon the Issuer complying with the public reporting requirements of the London Stock Exchange
(regardless of whether the Issuer’s ordinary shares are admitted for trading on such exchange), to the
extent that such requirements include an obligation to prepare and make publicly available annual
reports, information, documents and other reports with the London Stock Exchange, the Issuer will
be deemed to have complied with the provisions contained in clauses (i)(a), (b) and (c) above.

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer will be deemed to have provided such information to the
Trustee, the holders of the Notes and prospective purchasers of the Notes if such information
referenced above in clauses (i)(a), (b) and (c) above or alternatively, in the preceding paragraph, has
been posted on the Issuer’s website.

**_Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets_**

**_Issuer_**

(1) The Issuer will not, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions,
merge, consolidate, amalgamate or other combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, or take any action pursuant to any resolution passed
by the Issuer’s Board of Directors or shareholders with respect to a demerger or division pursuant to
which the Issuer would dispose of, all or substantially all of the Issuer’s properties and assets to any
other Person or Persons and the Issuer will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to enter into any

123


-----

such transaction or series of transactions if such transaction or series of transactions, in the
aggregate, would result in the sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition of all
or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis to any other Person or Persons. The previous sentence will not apply if at the time
and immediately after giving effect to any such transaction or series of transactions:

(a) either: (i) the Issuer will be the continuing corporation; or (ii) the Person (if other than the
Issuer) formed by or surviving any such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other
combination or to which such sale, assignment, conveyance, transfer, lease or disposition of all
or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Issuer and the Restricted Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis has been made (the “Surviving Entity”):

(x) will be a corporation duly incorporated and validly existing under the laws of any
member state of the European Union as at the Issue Date, the United States of America,
any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, Canada or any province of Canada,
Norway or Switzerland; and

(y) will expressly assume, by a supplemental indenture, in a form satisfactory to the
Trustee, the Issuer’s obligations under the Notes and the Indenture;

(b) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma
basis (and treating any obligation of the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary Incurred in
connection with or as a result of such transaction or series of transactions as having been
Incurred by the Issuer or such Restricted Subsidiary at the time of such transaction), no
Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing;

(c) immediately after giving effect to such transaction or series of transactions on a pro forma
basis (on the assumption that the transaction or series of transactions occurred on the first day
of the fiscal half immediately prior to the consummation of such transaction or series of
transactions with the appropriate adjustments with respect to the transaction or series of
transactions being included in such pro forma calculation), (i) the Issuer (or the Surviving
Entity if the Issuer is not the continuing obligor under the Indenture) could Incur at least £1.00
of additional Debt pursuant to the ratio set forth in paragraph (1) of the “Limitation on Debt”
covenant or (ii) the Consolidated Leverage Ratio would not be greater than the Consolidated
Leverage Ratio immediately before such transaction; and

(d) the Issuer or the Surviving Entity has delivered to the Trustee, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that
such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required in
connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with the requirements
of the Indenture and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction
have been satisfied and that the Indenture and the Notes constitute legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Issuer or the Surviving Entity, enforceable in accordance with their terms.

(2) The Surviving Entity will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and power
of, the Issuer under the Indenture, but, in the case of a lease of all or substantially all of the Issuer’s
assets, the Issuer will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of, premium, if any,
and interest, on the Notes.

(3) Nothing in the Indenture will prevent any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging
into or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any
other Restricted Subsidiary. The Issuer may consolidate or otherwise combine with or merge into an
Affiliate incorporated or organized for the purpose of changing the legal domicile of the Issuer,
reincorporating the Issuer in another jurisdiction or changing the legal form of the Issuer.

Although there is a limited body of case law interpreting the phrase “all or substantially all,” there is
no precise established definition of the phrase under applicable law. Accordingly, in certain
circumstances there may be a degree of uncertainty as to whether a particular transaction would
involve “all or substantially all” of the property or assets of a Person.

For as long as the Notes are listed on the Official List of the Exchange and to the extent that the rules
of the Exchange so require, the Issuer will notify the Exchange of any such merger, consolidation,
amalgamation or other combination or sale.

-----

**_Guarantors_**

(1) Subject to the provisions described under “—Guarantees—Release of the Guarantees,” no
Guarantor will, directly or indirectly, in a single transaction or through a series of transactions,
merge, consolidate, amalgamate or other combine with or into any other Person or sell, assign,
convey, transfer, lease or otherwise dispose of, or take any action pursuant to any resolution passed
by such Guarantor’s Board of Directors or shareholders with respect to a demerger or division
pursuant to which such Guarantor will dispose of, all or substantially all of such Guarantor’s
properties and assets to any other Person or Persons. The previous sentence will not apply if at the
time and immediately after giving effect to any such transaction or series of transactions:

(a) such Guarantor is the surviving corporation or the Person formed by or surviving any such
consolidation or merger (if other than such Guarantor) or to which such sale, assignment,
transfer, lease, conveyance or other disposition will have been made is a corporation organized
or existing under the laws of any member state of the European Union as at the Issue Date, the
United States of America, any state thereof, or the District of Columbia, Canada or any
province of Canada, Norway or Switzerland (such Guarantor or such Person, as the case may
be, being herein called the “Successor Guarantor”);

(b) the Successor Guarantor (if other than such Guarantor) expressly assumes all the obligations
of such Guarantor under its Guarantee and the Indenture, pursuant to supplemental indentures
and/or agreements in form reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee;

(c) immediately after giving pro forma effect to such transaction, no Default or Event of Default
exists and is continuing; and

(d) the Guarantor or the Successor Guarantor has delivered to the Trustee, in form and substance
satisfactory to the Trustee, an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating that
such merger, consolidation, amalgamation or other combination or sale, assignment,
conveyance, transfer, lease or other disposition, and if a supplemental indenture is required in
connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture, comply with the requirements
of the Indenture and that all conditions precedent in the Indenture relating to such transaction
have been satisfied and that the Indenture and the Guarantee constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of the Guarantor or Successor Guarantor, enforceable in accordance with its
terms.

(2) The Successor Guarantor will succeed to, and be substituted for, and may exercise every right and
power of, the relevant Guarantor under the Indenture.

(3) Nothing in the Indenture prevents any Restricted Subsidiary from consolidating with, merging into
or transferring all or substantially all of its properties and assets to the Issuer, a Guarantor or any
other Restricted Subsidiary.

**_Statement as to Compliance_**

The Issuer will deliver to the Trustee no later than the date on which the Issuer is required to deliver annual
reports pursuant to the covenant described under “—Reports to Holders” above, an Officer’s Certificate stating
that in the course of the performance by the relevant officers of their respective duties as an officer of the Issuer
they would normally have knowledge of any Default and whether or not such officers know of any Default that
occurred during such period and, if any, specifying such Default, its status and what action the Issuer is taking or
proposes to take with respect thereto.

**_Payments for Consent_**

The Issuer will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, pay or
cause to be paid any consideration to or for the benefit of any Holder of Notes for or as an inducement to any
consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or provisions of the Indenture or the Notes unless such
consideration is offered to be paid and is paid to all Holders of the Notes that consent, waive or agree to amend in
the time frame set forth in any documents distributed relating to such consent, waiver or agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be permitted, in any offer or
payment of consideration for, or as an inducement to, any consent, waiver or amendment of any of the terms or
provisions of the Indenture or the Notes, to exclude Holders of the Notes in any jurisdiction where (1) the
solicitation of such consent, waiver or amendment, including in connection with an exchange offer or offer to
purchase for cash or (2) the payment of the consideration therefor (i) could reasonably be interpreted to require

125


-----

the Issuer or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to file a registration statement, prospectus or similar document
under any applicable securities laws or listing requirements (including, but not limited to, the U.S. federal
securities laws, the United Kingdom and the laws of the European Union or its member states), which the Issuer
in its sole discretion determines (acting in good faith) would be materially burdensome; or (ii) such solicitation
would otherwise not be permitted under applicable law in such jurisdiction.

**_Suspension of Covenants on Achievement of Investment Grade Status_**

If on any date following the Issue Date, the Notes have achieved Investment Grade Status and no Default or
Event of Default has occurred and is continuing (a “Suspension Event”), then, beginning on that day and
continuing until such time, if any, at which the Notes cease to have Investment Grade Status (the “Reversion
**Date”), the provisions of the Indenture summarized under the following captions will not apply to the Notes:**

(1) “—Limitation on Restricted Payments”;

(2) “—Limitation on Debt”;

(3) “—Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting Restricted Subsidiaries”;

(4) “—Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates”; and

(5) “—Limitation on Asset Sales.”

and, in each case, any related default provision of the Indenture will cease to be effective and will not be
applicable to the Issuer and its Restricted Subsidiaries.

Such covenants and any related default provisions will again apply according to their terms from the first
day on which a Suspension Event ceases to be in effect. Such covenants will not, however, be of any effect with
regard to actions of the Issuer or its Restricted Subsidiaries properly taken during the continuance of the
Suspension Event, and no action taken prior to the Reversion Date will constitute a Default or Event of Default.
The “Limitation on Restricted Payments” covenant will be interpreted as if it has been in effect since the date of
the Indenture but not during the continuance of the Suspension Event. On the Reversion Date, all Debt Incurred
during the continuance of the Suspension Event will be deemed to have been outstanding on the Issue Date, so
that it is classified as permitted under clause (c) of the second paragraph of the covenant described under
“—Limitation on Debt”. In addition, the Indenture will also permit, without causing a Default or Event of
Default, the Issuer or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to honor any contractual commitments or take actions in
the future after any date on which the Notes cease to have an Investment Grade Status as long as the contractual
commitments were entered into during the Suspension Event and not in anticipation of the Notes no longer
having an Investment Grade Status. Upon the occurrence of a Suspension Event, the amount of Excess Proceeds
shall be reset at zero. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee that the conditions set forth in the first paragraph under
this caption has been satisfied, provided that, no such notification shall be a condition for the suspension of the
covenants described under this caption to be effective. There can be no assurance that the Notes will ever achieve
or maintain an Investment Grade Status.

**_Financial calculations for Limited Condition Acquisitions_**

When calculating the availability under any basket or ratio under the Indenture, in each case in connection
with a Limited Condition Acquisition, the date of determination of such basket or ratio and of any Default or
Event of Default shall, at the option of the Issuer, be the date the definitive agreements for such Limited
Condition Acquisition are entered into and such baskets or ratios shall be calculated on a pro forma basis after
giving effect to such Limited Condition Acquisition and the other transactions to be entered into in connection
therewith (including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds thereof) as if they occurred at the beginning
of the applicable reference period for purposes of determining the ability to consummate any such Limited
Condition Acquisition (and not for purposes of any subsequent availability of any basket or ratio).

For the avoidance of doubt, (x) if any of such baskets or ratios are exceeded as a result of fluctuations in
such basket or ratio (including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA of the Company or the target
company) subsequent to such date of determination and at or prior to the consummation of the relevant Limited
Condition Acquisition, such baskets or ratios will not be deemed to have been exceeded as a result of such
fluctuations solely for purposes of determining whether the Limited Condition Acquisition and the related
transactions are permitted hereunder and (y) such baskets or ratios shall not be tested at the time of
consummation of such Limited Condition Acquisition or related transactions; provided, further, that if the Issuer
elects to have such determinations occur at the time of entry into such definitive agreement, any such transactions
(including any Incurrence of Debt and the use of proceeds thereof) shall be deemed to have occurred on the date

126


-----

the definitive agreements are entered into and outstanding thereafter for purposes of calculating any baskets or
ratios under the Indenture after the date of such agreement and before the consummation of such Limited
Condition Acquisition.

**Events of Default**

Each of the following will be an “Event of Default” under the Indenture:

(a) default for 30 days in the payment when due of any interest or any Additional Amounts on any Note;

(b) default in the payment of the principal of or premium, if any, on any Note at its Maturity (upon
acceleration, optional or mandatory redemption, if any, required repurchase or otherwise);

(c) failure to comply with the provisions of “—Certain Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of
_Assets;”_

(d) [reserved];

(e) failure to comply with any covenant or agreement of the Issuer or of any Restricted Subsidiary that is
contained in the Indenture (other than specified in clause (a), (b) or (c) above) and such failure
continues for a period of 60 days after notice by the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in
principal amount of the outstanding Notes;

(f) default under the terms of any instrument evidencing or securing the Debt of the Issuer or any
Restricted Subsidiary having an outstanding principal amount in excess of £40.0 million individually
or in the aggregate, if that default:

(x) results in the acceleration of the payment of such Debt; or

(y) is caused by the failure to pay such Debt at final maturity thereof after giving effect to the
expiration of any applicable grace periods (and other than by regularly scheduled required
prepayment) and such failure to make any payment has not been waived or the maturity of
such Debt has not been extended;

(g) any Guarantee ceases to be, or shall be asserted in writing by any Guarantor, or any Person acting on
behalf of any Guarantor, not to be in full force and effect or enforceable in accordance with its terms
(other than as provided for in the Indenture or any Guarantee);

(h) one or more final judgments, orders or decrees (not subject to appeal and not covered by insurance)
shall have been rendered against the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary either individually or in an
aggregate amount, in each case in excess of £40.0 million, and either a creditor shall have
commenced an enforcement proceeding upon such judgment, order or decree or there shall have
been a period of 60 consecutive days or more during which a stay of enforcement of such judgment,
order or decree was not (by reason of pending appeal or otherwise) in effect; and

(i) the occurrence of certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, schemes of arrangement
(where any creditors are impaired) or reorganization with respect to the Issuer or any Restricted
Subsidiary.

However, a Default under clauses (e), (f) or (h) above will not constitute an Event of Default until the
Trustee or the Holders of 25% in principal amount of the outstanding Notes under the Indenture notify the Issuer
of the Default and, with respect to clauses (e) and (h) the Issuer does not cure such default within the time
specified in clauses (e) or (h) above, as applicable, after receipt of such notice.

If an Event of Default (other than as specified in clause (i) above) occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or
the Holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding by written notice to
the Issuer (and to the Trustee if such notice is given by the holders) may, and the Trustee, upon the written
request of such Holders, shall, declare the principal of, premium, if any, any Additional Amounts and accrued
interest on all of the outstanding Notes immediately due and payable, and upon any such declaration all such
amounts payable in respect of the Notes will become immediately due and payable.

If an Event of Default specified in clause (i) above occurs and is continuing, then the principal of, premium,
if any, Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the outstanding Notes shall become and be
immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder of
Notes.

In the event of a declaration of acceleration of the Notes because an Event of Default described in clause
(f) under “Events of Default” has occurred and is continuing, the declaration of acceleration of the Notes shall be

127


-----

automatically annulled if the event of default or payment default triggering such Event of Default pursuant to
clause (f) shall be remedied or cured, or waived by the holders of the Debt, or the Debt that gave rise to such
Event of Default shall have been discharged in full, within 30 days after the declaration of acceleration with
respect thereto and if (1) the annulment of the acceleration of the Notes would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction and (2) all existing Events of Default, except non-payment of
principal, premium or interest on the Notes that became due solely because of the acceleration of the Notes, have
been cured or waived.

The Holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes may, on
behalf of the Holders of all of the Notes, waive any past defaults under the Indenture (except a default in the
payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on any Note in which case, the
consent of the holders of 90% of the then outstanding Notes shall be required) and rescind any such acceleration
with respect to such Notes and its consequences if such rescission would not conflict with any judgment or
decree of a court of competent jurisdiction.

No Holder of any of the Notes has any right to institute any proceedings with respect to the Indenture or any
remedy thereunder unless the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding Notes
have made a written request and offered an indemnity and/or security satisfactory to the Trustee to institute such
proceeding as Trustee under the Notes and the Indenture, the Trustee has failed to institute such proceeding
within 60 days after receipt of such notice and the Trustee within such 60-day period has not received directions
inconsistent with such written request by holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding
Notes. Such limitations do not, however, apply to a suit instituted by a Holder of a Note for the enforcement of
the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and Additional Amounts or interest on such Note on or after the
respective due dates expressed in such Note.

If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing and notice from the Issuer is given to the Trustee in
accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will mail to each Holder of the Notes notice
of the Event of Default within 60 Business Days after its occurrence. Except in the case of an Event of Default in
the payment of principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts or interest on any Notes, the Trustee may
withhold the giving of such notice to the holders of such Notes if it determines in good faith that withholding the
giving of such notice is in the best interests of the holders of the Notes.

The Indenture will provide that (1) if a Default occurs for a failure to deliver a required certificate in
connection with another default (an “Initial Default”) then at the time such Initial Default is cured, such Default
for a failure to report or deliver a required certificate in connection with the Initial Default will also be cured
without any further action and (2) any Default or Event of Default for the failure to comply with the time periods
prescribed in the covenant entitled “Certain Covenants—Reports to Holders” or otherwise to deliver any notice
or certificate pursuant to any other provision of the Indenture shall be deemed to be cured upon the delivery of
any such report required by such covenant or notice or certificate, as applicable, even though such delivery is not
within the prescribed period specified in the Indenture.

The Trustee may assume without inquiry, in the absence of actual knowledge, that the Company is duly
complying with its obligations contained in the Indenture required to be observed and performed by it, and that
no Default or Event of Default or other event that would require repayment of the Notes has occurred.

The Trustee is under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers vested in it by the Indenture at the
request or direction of any of the holders of the Notes unless such holders offer to the Trustee indemnity and/or
security satisfactory to the Trustee against the costs, expenses and liabilities which might be incurred thereby.

**Defeasance**

The Indenture will provide that the Issuer may, at its option and at any time prior to the Stated Maturity of
the Notes, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors discharged with respect to the
outstanding Notes (“Legal Defeasance”). Legal Defeasance means that the Issuer will be deemed to have paid
and discharged the entire Debt represented by the outstanding Notes except as to:

(a) the rights of holders of outstanding Notes to receive payments in respect of the principal of,
premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on such Notes when such payments are due from
the trust referred to below;

(b) the Issuer’s obligations to issue temporary Notes, register, transfer or exchange any Notes, replace
mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Notes, maintain an office or agency for payments in respect of
the Notes and segregate and hold such payments on trust;

128


-----

(c) the rights, powers, trusts, duties and immunities of the Trustee and the obligations of the Issuer and
the Guarantors in connection therewith; and

(d) the Legal Defeasance provisions of the Indenture.

If the Issuer exercises its legal defeasance option, payment of the Notes may not be accelerated because of
an Event of Default other than an Event of Default under clauses (a) or (b) of the definition thereof.

In addition, the Issuer may, at its option and at any time, elect to have the obligations of the Issuer and the
Guarantors released with respect to certain covenants set forth in the Indenture (“Covenant Defeasance”) and
thereafter any failure to comply with such covenants will not constitute a Default or an Event of Default with
respect to the Notes. In the event that a Covenant Defeasance occurs, certain events described under “—Events of
_Default” will no longer constitute an Event of Default with respect to the Notes. These events will not include_
events relating to non-payment, bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership and reorganization. The Issuer may
exercise its Legal Defeasance option regardless of whether it has previously exercised any Covenant Defeasance.

In order to exercise either Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance:

(a) the Issuer must irrevocably deposit or cause to be deposited on trust with the Trustee, or such entity
(as Agent) as the Trustee may designate for this purpose, for the benefit of the holders of the Notes,
cash in Sterling, UK Government Obligations or a combination thereof, in such amounts as will be
sufficient, in the opinion of an internationally recognized firm of independent public accountants, to
pay and discharge the principal of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest, on the
outstanding Notes on the Stated Maturity or on the applicable redemption date, as the case may be,
and the Issuer must:

(i) specify whether the Notes are being defeased to maturity or to a particular redemption date;
and

(ii) if applicable, have delivered to the Trustee an irrevocable notice to redeem all of the
outstanding Notes;

(b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee stating that: (x) the Issuer has received from, or there has been
published by, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service a ruling; or (y) since the Issue Date, there has been a
change in applicable U.S. federal income tax law, in either case to the effect that (and based thereon
such opinion shall confirm that) the holders of the outstanding Notes will not recognize income, gain
or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of such Legal Defeasance and will be subject
to U.S. federal income tax on the same amounts, in the same manner and at the same times as would
have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(c) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee opinions of counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee to the effect that the holders of the outstanding Notes will not
recognize income, gain or loss for tax purposes in the United Kingdom as a result of such Legal
Defeasance and will be subject to tax in the United Kingdom on the same amounts, in the same manner
and at the same times as would have been the case if such Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

(d) no Default or Event of Default will have occurred and be continuing: (i) on the date of such deposit
(other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of funds to be applied to such
deposit); or (ii) insofar as bankruptcy or insolvency events described in clause (i) of “—Events of
_Default” above are concerned, at any time during the period ending on the 123rd day after the date of_
such deposit;

(e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance will not result in a breach or violation of, or
constitute a Default under (other than a Default or Event of Default resulting from the borrowing of
funds to be applied to such deposit), the Indenture or any material agreement or instrument to which
the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary is a party or by which the Issuer or any Restricted Subsidiary
is bound;

(f) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an opinion of counsel in the country of the Issuer’s
incorporation to the effect that after the 123rd day following the deposit, the trust funds will not be
subject to the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization or similar laws
affecting creditors’ rights generally and an opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to the Trustee
that the Trustee shall have a perfected security interest in such trust funds for the ratable benefit of
the holders of the Notes;

129


-----

(g) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate stating that the deposit was not
made by the Issuer with the intent of preferring the holders of the Notes over the other creditors of
the Issuer with the intent of defeating, hindering, delaying or defrauding creditors of the Issuer or
other creditors, or removing assets beyond the reach of the relevant creditors or increasing debts of
the Issuer to the detriment of the relevant creditors;

(h) no event or condition exists that would prevent the Issuer from making payments of the principal of,
premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes on the date of such deposit or at any
time ending on the 123rd day after the date of such deposit; and

(i) the Issuer must have delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each
stating that all conditions precedent provided for relating to the Legal Defeasance or the Covenant
Defeasance, as the case may be, have been complied with.

If the funds deposited with the Trustee to effect Covenant Defeasance are insufficient to pay the principal
of, premium, if any, Additional Amounts and interest on the Notes when due because of any acceleration
occurring after an Event of Default, then the Issuer and the Guarantors will remain liable for such payments.

**Satisfaction and Discharge**

The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect (except as to surviving rights of
registration of transfer or exchange of the Notes as expressly provided for in the Indenture) when:

(a) the Issuer has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with the Trustee (or such entity
designated (as Agent) by the Trustee for this purpose) as funds on trust for such purpose an amount
in Sterling or UK Government Obligations sufficient to pay and discharge the entire Debt on such
Notes that have not, prior to such time, been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, for principal
of, premium, if any, and any Additional Amounts and accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes to
the date of such deposit (in the case of Notes which have become due and payable) or to the Stated
Maturity or redemption date, as the case may be, and the Issuer has delivered irrevocable
instructions to the Trustee under the Indenture to apply the deposited money toward the payment of
Notes at Stated Maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be and either:

(i) all of the Notes that have been authenticated and delivered (other than destroyed, lost or stolen
Notes that have been replaced or paid and Notes for which payment money has been deposited
on trust or segregated and held on trust by the Issuer and thereafter repaid to the Issuer or
discharged from such trust as provided for in the Indenture) have been delivered to the Trustee
for cancellation; or

(ii) all Notes that have not been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation: (x) have become due and
payable (by reason of the mailing of a notice of redemption or otherwise); (y) will become due
and payable within one year of Stated Maturity; or (z) are to be called for redemption within
one year of the proposed discharge date under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the
giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the Issuer’s name and at the Issuer’s expense;

(b) the Issuer has paid or caused to be paid all other sums payable by the Issuer under the Indenture;

(c) the Issuer has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward
the payment of the Notes at maturity or on the redemption date, as the case may be; and

(d) the Issuer has delivered to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate and an opinion of counsel, each stating
that:

(i) all conditions precedent provided in the Indenture relating to the satisfaction and discharge of
the Indenture have been satisfied; and

(ii) such satisfaction and discharge will not result in a breach or violation of, or constitute a
default under, the Indenture or any other agreement or instrument to which the Issuer or any
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Issuer or any Subsidiary is bound.

The Trustee shall be entitled to rely conclusively on such Officer’s Certificate and opinion of counsel
without independent verification, provided that any such counsel may rely on an Officer’s Certificate as to
matters of fact) (including as to compliance with the foregoing clauses (a), (b) and (c)).

130


-----

If requested by the Issuer, the Trustee may distribute any amounts deposited in trust to the holders of the
Notes prior to maturity or the redemption date, as the case may be. In such case, the payment to each Holder will
equal the amount such Holder would have been entitled to receive at maturity or on the relevant redemption date,
as the case may be.

**Amendments and Waivers**

With the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then
outstanding (including consents obtained in connection with a purchase of, or tender offer or exchange offer for,
such Notes), the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee are permitted to amend or supplement the Indenture or
waive any default or compliance with any provisions thereof; provided that no such modification, amendment or
waiver may, without the consent of Holders holding not less than 90% of the then outstanding principal amount
of the Notes then outstanding (or, alternatively, the consent of each Holder affected thereby):

(a) extend the Stated Maturity of the principal of, or any installment of or Additional Amounts or
interest on, any Note (or change any Default or Event of Default under clause (a) of the definition
thereof related thereto);

(b) reduce the principal amount of any Note (or Additional Amounts or premium, if any) or the rate of
or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any Note (or change any Default or Event of
Default under clause (b) of the definition thereof related thereto);

(c) change the coin or currency in which the principal of any Note or any premium or any Additional
Amounts or the interest thereon is payable on or after the due dates thereof;

(d) impair the right to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment of any Note in accordance with
the provisions of such Note and the Indenture;

(e) make any change to the amendment or waiver provisions which require the Holders’ consent
described in this sentence;

(f) release any Guarantee except in compliance with the terms of the Indenture.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, without the consent of any Holder of the Notes, the Issuer, the Guarantors
and the Trustee may modify, amend or supplement the Indenture to:

(a) evidence the succession of another Person to the Issuer or a Guarantor and the assumption by any
such successor of the covenants in the Indenture and in the Notes in accordance with “—Certain
_Covenants—Merger, Consolidation or Sale of Assets;”_

(b) add to the Issuer’s covenants and those of any Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of the Notes
for the benefit of the holders of the Notes or to surrender any right or power conferred upon the
Issuer or any Guarantor or any other obligor in respect of the Notes, as applicable, in the Indenture,
the Notes or any Guarantee;

(c) cure any ambiguity, omission, defect error or inconsistency;

(d) conform the text of the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee to any provision of this Description of
the Notes to the extent that such provision in this Description of the Notes was intended to be a
verbatim recitation of a provision of the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee;

(e) release any Guarantor in accordance with (and if permitted by) the terms of the Indenture;

(f) add a Guarantor under the Indenture;

(g) evidence and provide the acceptance of the appointment of a successor Trustee under the Indenture;

(h) make any change that would provide additional rights or benefits to the Trustee or the Holders or
that does not adversely affect the rights or benefits to the Trustee or any of the Holders in any
material respect under the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee; and

(i) provide for the issuance of Additional Notes in accordance with and if permitted by the terms of and
limitations set forth in the Indenture.

In formulating its opinion on such matters, the Trustee shall be entitled to request and rely on such evidence
as it deems fit, including, but not limited to, Officer’s Certificates and opinions of counsel.

The consent of the Holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any
proposed amendment to the Indenture, the Notes or any Guarantee. It is sufficient if such consent approves the

131


-----

substance of the proposed amendment. A consent to any amendment or waiver under the Indenture by any
Holder of the Notes given in connection with a tender of such Holder’s Notes will not be rendered invalid by
such tender.

**Currency Indemnity**

Sterling is the sole currency of account and payment for all sums payable under the Notes, the Guarantees
and the Indenture. Any amount received or recovered in respect of the Notes or the Guarantees in a currency
other than Sterling (whether as a result of, or of the enforcement of, a judgment or order of a court of any
jurisdiction, in the winding up or dissolution of the Issuer, any Subsidiary or otherwise) by the Trustee and/or a
Holder of the Notes in respect of any sum expressed to be due to such Holder from the Issuer or the Guarantors
will constitute a discharge of their obligation only to the extent of the Sterling amount which the recipient is able
to purchase with the amount so received or recovered in such other currency on the date of that receipt or
recovery (or, if it is not possible to purchase Sterling on that date, on the first date on which it is possible to do
so). If the Sterling amount that could be recovered following such a purchase is less than the Sterling amount
expressed to be due to the recipient under any Note, the Issuer and the Guarantors will jointly and severally
indemnify the recipient against the cost of the recipient’s making a further purchase of Sterling in an amount
equal to such difference. For the purposes of this paragraph, it will be sufficient for the Trustee and/or Holder to
certify that it would have suffered a loss had the actual purchase of Sterling been made with the amount so
received in that other currency on the date of receipt or recovery (or, if a purchase of Sterling on that date had not
been possible, on the first date on which it would have been possible). These indemnities, to the extent permitted
by law:

(a) constitute a separate and independent obligation from the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ other
obligations;

(b) give rise to a separate and independent cause of action;

(c) apply irrespective of any waiver granted by any Holder of a Note; and

(d) will continue in full force and effect despite any other judgment, order, claim or proof for a
liquidated amount in respect of any sum due under any Note or any other judgment or order.

**Notices**

All notices to Holders will be validly given if mailed to them at their respective addresses in the register of
the Holders, if any, maintained by the Registrar. In addition, for so long as any Notes are listed on the Exchange
and the rules of the Exchange so require, any such notice to the Holders shall also be posted on the official
website of the Exchange (www.thecise.com). In addition, for Notes which are represented by global certificates
held on behalf of Euroclear or Clearstream, all notices to Holders will be given by delivery to Euroclear or
Clearstream in substitution for the aforesaid mailing.

Each such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the date of such publication or, if published more
than once on different dates, on the first date on which publication is made, provided that, if notices are mailed,
such notice shall be deemed to have been given on the later of such publication and the seventh day after being so
mailed. Any notice or communication mailed to a Holder shall be mailed to such Person by first- class mail or
other equivalent means and shall be sufficiently given to him if so mailed within the time prescribed. Failure to
mail a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other
Holders. If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner provided above, it is duly given, whether or not
the addressee receives it.

**No Personal Liability of Directors, Officers, Employees and Stockholders**

No director, officer, employee, incorporator or stockholder of the Issuer or any Guarantor, as such, will have
any liability for any obligations of the Issuer or the Guarantors under the Notes, the Indenture, the Guarantees or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or their creation. Each Holder of Notes by
accepting a Note will waive and release all such liability. The waiver and release will be part of the consideration
for issuance of the Notes. The waiver may not be effective to waive liabilities under U.S. federal securities laws.

**The Trustee**

BNY Mellon Corporate Trustee Services Limited is to be appointed as Trustee under the Indenture. The
Indenture will provide that, except during the continuance of an Event of Default of which notice from the Issuer

is given to the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the Trustee will perform only
such duties as are set forth specifically in the Indenture. During the existence of an Event of Default, of which
notice from the Issuer is given to the Trustee in accordance with the notice provisions of the Indenture, the
Trustee will exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it under the Indenture and use the same degree of
care that a prudent Person would use in conducting its own affairs. The permissive rights of the Trustee to take or
refrain from taking any action enumerated in the Indenture will not be construed as an obligation or duty. The
Trustee will be permitted to engage in other transactions with the Issuer and its Affiliates and Subsidiaries.

The Indenture will contain provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability, taxes and
expenses incurred without gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud on its part, arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of the Indenture.

The Indenture contains provisions for the indemnification of the Trustee and for its relief from
responsibility, including provisions relieving it from taking action unless indemnified and/or secured to its

**BOOK-ENTRY; DELIVERY AND FORM**

**GENERAL**

The Notes will be sold outside the United States pursuant to Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act and
will initially be represented by a global note in registered form without interest coupons attached (the “Global
**Note”). The Global Note will be deposited, on the Issue Date, with a common depository and registered in the**
name of the nominee of the common depository for the accounts of Euroclear and Clearstream.

Ownership of interests in the Global Note (the “Book-Entry Interests”) will be limited to persons that have
accounts with Euroclear and/or Clearstream or persons that may hold interests through such participants.
Book-Entry Interests will be shown on, and transfers thereof will be effected only through, records maintained in
book-entry form by Euroclear and Clearstream and their participants. The Book-Entry Interests in the Notes will
be issued only in denominations of £100,000 and in integral multiples of £1,000 in excess thereof.

The Book-Entry Interests will not be held in definitive form. Instead, Euroclear or Clearstream, as
applicable, will credit on their respective book-entry registration and transfer systems a participant’s account
with the interest beneficially owned by such participant. The laws of some jurisdictions may require that certain
purchasers of securities take physical delivery of such securities in definitive form. The foregoing limitations
may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge Book-Entry Interests. In addition, while the Notes are in global
form, owners of interest in the Global Note will not have the Notes registered in their names, will not receive
physical delivery of the Notes in certificated form and will not be considered the registered owners or “holders”
of Notes under the Indenture for any purpose.

So long as the Notes are held in global form, the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream (or its
nominee) will be considered the sole holder of the Global Note for all purposes under the Indenture. As such,
participants must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and indirect participants
must rely on the procedures of Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, and the participants through which
they own Book-Entry Interests in order to exercise any rights of holders under the Indenture.

Neither we, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, the Trustee, nor any of our or their respective agents will have
any responsibility or be liable for any aspect of the records relating to the Book-Entry Interests.

The Notes will be issued in registered form in minimum denominations of £100,000 and integral multiples
of £1,000 in excess thereof.

**DEFINITIVE REGISTERED NOTES**

Under the terms of the Indenture, owners of Book-Entry Interests will receive definitive Notes in registered
form (the “Definitive Registered Notes”):

   - if Euroclear or Clearstream notifies the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as depositary
and a successor depositary is not appointed by the Issuer within 120 days,

   - if the Issuer, at its option, notifies the Trustee and the Paying Agent in writing that it elects to exchange in
whole, but not in part, the Global Note for Definitive Registered Notes,

   - if Euroclear or Clearstream so requests following an event of default under the Indenture, or

   - if the owner of a Book-Entry Interest requests such exchange in writing delivered through Euroclear and
Clearstream following an event of default under the Indenture.

In such an event, the Registrar will issue Definitive Registered Notes, registered in the name or names of the
owner and issued in any approved denominations, requested by or on behalf of Euroclear, Clearstream, or the
Issuer, as applicable (in accordance with their respective customary procedures and based upon directions
received from participants reflecting the beneficial ownership of Book-Entry Interests), and such Definitive
Registered Notes will bear the restrictive legend referred to in the section entitled “Notice to Investors”, unless
that legend is not required by the Indenture or applicable law.

To the extent permitted by law, we, the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the Registrar, or any of our or their
respective agents, shall be entitled to treat the registered holder of the Global Note as the absolute owner thereof
and no person will be liable for treating the registered holder as such.

We will not impose any fees or other charges in respect of the Notes, however, owners of the Book-Entry
Interests may incur fees normally payable in respect of the maintenance and operation of accounts in Euroclear
and/or Clearstream, as applicable.

154


-----

**REDEMPTION OF THE GLOBAL NOTE**

In the event the Global Note, or any portion thereof, is redeemed, Euroclear and/or Clearstream, will
distribute the amount received by it in respect of the Global Note so redeemed to the holders of the Book-Entry
Interests in such Global Note from the amount received by it in respect of the redemption of the Global Note. The
redemption price payable in connection with the redemption of such Book-Entry Interests will be equal to the
amount received by Euroclear or Clearstream in connection with the redemption of such Global Note (or any
portion thereof). We understand that, under existing practices of Euroclear and Clearstream, if fewer than all of
the Notes are to be redeemed at any time, Euroclear and Clearstream will credit their respective participants’
accounts on a proportionate basis (with adjustments to prevent fractions) or on such other basis as they deem fair
and appropriate, provided, however, that no Book-Entry Interest of less than £100,000 principal amount at
maturity, or less, may be redeemed in part.

**PAYMENTS ON THE GLOBAL NOTE**

Payments of any amounts owing in respect of the Global Note (including principal, premium, interest,
additional interest and additional amounts) will be made by the Issuer to the Paying Agent. The Paying Agent
will, in turn, make such payments to the order of the common depositary for Euroclear and Clearstream, which
will distribute such payments to participants in accordance with their respective procedures.

Under the Indenture, the Issuer, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent and any our or their respective
agents will treat the registered holder of the Global Note (for example, the nominee for the common depositary
of Euroclear or Clearstream) as the owner thereof for the purpose of receiving payments and for all other
purposes. Consequently, neither we, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, nor any of our or their
respective agents has or will have any responsibility or liability for:

   - any aspects of the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to,
or payments made on account of, a Book-Entry Interest, for any such payments made by Euroclear or
Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining, supervising or reviewing the
records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant relating to, or payments made
on account of, a Book-Entry Interest; or

   - payments made by Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant, or for maintaining,
supervising or reviewing the records of Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant
relating to or payments made on account of a Book-Entry Interest; or

   - Euroclear, Clearstream or any participant or indirect participant.

Payments by participants to owners of Book-Entry Interests held through participants are the responsibility
of such participants, as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of subscribers registered in “street
name.”

**CURRENCY OF PAYMENT FOR THE GLOBAL NOTE**

The principal of, premium, if any, and interest on, and all other amounts payable in respect of, the Global
Note, will be paid to holders of interest in such Notes through Euroclear and/or Clearstream, as applicable, in
British pounds sterling.

**ACTION BY OWNERS OF BOOK-ENTRY INTERESTS**

Euroclear and Clearstream have advised the Issuer that they will take any action permitted to be taken by a
holder of the Notes only at the direction of one or more participants to whose account the Book-Entry Interests in
the Global Note are credited and only in respect of such portion of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes as
to which such participant or participants has or have given such direction. Euroclear and Clearstream will not
exercise any discretion in the granting of consents, waivers or the taking of any other action in respect of the
Global Note. However, if there is an event of default under the Indenture, each of Euroclear and Clearstream
reserves the right to exchange the Global Note for Definitive Registered Notes in certificated form, and to
distribute such Definitive Registered Notes to their respective participants.

**TRANSFERS**

Transfers between participants in Euroclear and/or Clearstream will be effected in accordance with
Euroclear’s and/or Clearstream’s rules, as applicable, and will be settled in immediately available funds. If a

155


-----

holder of Notes requires physical delivery of Definitive Registered Notes for any reason, including to sell the
Notes to persons in territories which require physical delivery of such securities or to pledge such securities, such
holder of Notes must transfer its interests in the Global Note in accordance with the normal procedures of
Euroclear and Clearstream and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

The Global Note will bear a legend to the effect set forth in the section entitled “Notice to Investors.” Book
Entry Interests in the Global Note will be subject to the restrictions on transfers and certification requirements
discussed in the section entitled “Notice to Investors.”

**INFORMATION CONCERNING EUROCLEAR AND CLEARSTREAM**

All Book-Entry Interests will be subject to the operations and procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream, as
applicable. We provide the following summaries of those operations and procedures solely for the convenience
of investors. The operations and procedures of each settlement system are controlled by that settlement system
and may be changed at any time. Neither we, nor the Initial Purchasers are responsible for those operations or
procedures.

The Issuer understands as follows with respect to Euroclear and Clearstream: Euroclear and Clearstream
hold securities for participating organisations. They also facilitate the clearance and settlement of securities
transactions between their respective participants through electronic book-entry changes in the accounts of such
participants. Euroclear and Clearstream provide to their participants, among other things, services for
safekeeping, administration, clearance, settlement, lending and borrowing of internationally traded securities.
Euroclear and Clearstream interface with domestic securities markets. Euroclear and Clearstream participants are
financial institutions, such as underwriters, securities brokers and dealers, banks, trust companies and certain
other organisations. Indirect access to Euroclear and/or Clearstream is also available to others, such as banks,
brokers, dealers and trust companies, that clear through or maintain a custodian relationship with a Euroclear
and/or Clearstream participant, either directly or indirectly.

Because Euroclear and Clearstream can only act on behalf of participants, who in turn act on behalf of
indirect participants and certain banks, the ability of an owner of a beneficial interest to pledge such interest to
persons or entities that do not participate in the Euroclear or Clearstream systems, or otherwise take actions in
respect of such interest, may be limited by the lack of a definite certificate for that interest. The laws of some
jurisdictions require that certain persons take physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Consequently, the
ability to transfer beneficial interests to such person may be limited.

**GLOBAL CLEARANCE AND SETTLEMENT UNDER THE BOOK-ENTRY SYSTEM**

The Notes represented by the Global Note are expected to be admitted to the Official List of the Exchange
and to be admitted to trading thereon, and any permitted secondary market trading activity in such Notes will
therefore be required to be settled in immediately available funds.

Although Euroclear and Clearstream currently follow the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate
transfers of interests in the Global Note among participants in Euroclear or Clearstream, as the case may be, they
are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures, and such procedures may be
discontinued or modified at any time. Neither we, the Trustee, the Registrar, the Paying Agent, nor any of our or
their respective agents, will have any responsibility for the performance by Euroclear or Clearstream or their
respective participants or indirect participants, of their respective obligations under the rules and procedures
governing their operations.

**Initial Settlement**

Initial settlement for the Notes will be made in British pounds sterling. Book-Entry Interests owned through
Euroclear or Clearstream accounts will follow the settlement procedures applicable to conventional bonds in
registered form. Book-Entry Interests will be credited to the securities custody accounts of Euroclear and
Clearstream holders on the business day following the settlement date against payment for value on the
settlement date.

**Secondary Market Trading**

The Book-Entry Interests will trade through participants of Euroclear or Clearstream and will settle in
same-day funds. Since the purchase determines the place of delivery, it is important to establish at the time of
trading of any Book-Entry Interests where both the purchaser’s and the seller’s accounts are located to ensure
that settlement can be made on the desired value date.

**TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain tax consequences of the Offering and is intended as general_
_information only._

**UK TAX CONSIDERATIONS**

The following is a summary of certain UK income tax considerations in relation to payments of interest and
principal with respect to the Notes and certain other UK tax considerations in respect of the Notes. It is based on
current law and the published practice of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”), which may be
subject to change, sometimes with retrospective effect. The comments do not deal with other UK tax aspects of
acquiring, holding or disposing of Notes. The comments relate only to the position of persons who are absolute
beneficial owners of the Notes and may not apply to certain classes of persons, such as dealers in securities, to
whom special rules may apply. The following is a general summary for information purposes and should be
treated with appropriate caution. It is not intended to be tax advice and it does not purport to describe all of the
tax considerations that may be relevant to a prospective purchaser of Notes. Holders of the Notes who may be
liable to taxation in jurisdictions other than the UK in respect of their acquisition, holding or disposal of the
Notes are particularly advised to consult their professional advisors as to whether they are so liable (and if so
under the laws of which jurisdictions), since the following comments relate only to certain UK taxation aspects
of payments in respect of the Notes. In particular, holders of the Notes should be aware that they may be liable to
taxation under the laws of other jurisdictions in relation to payments in respect of the Notes even if such
payments may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of taxation under the laws of the UK.
Holders of the Notes should consult their own professional advisors with respect to their tax position.

**Interest on the Notes**

The Notes will constitute “quoted Eurobonds”, provided they are and continue to be “listed on a recognised
stock exchange” within the meaning of Section 1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. While the Notes are and
continue to be quoted Eurobonds, payments of interest on the Notes may be made without withholding or
deduction for or on account of UK income tax.

The Notes will be “listed on a recognised stock exchange” for this purpose if they are admitted to trading on
an exchange designated as a “recognised stock exchange” by an order made by the Commissioners for HMRC
and either they are included in the UK official list (within the meaning of Part 6 of the Financial Services and
Markets Act 2000) or they are officially listed, in accordance with provisions corresponding to those generally
applicable in EEA states, in a country outside the UK in which there is a “recognised stock exchange.” The
Exchange is a “recognised stock exchange” for this purpose. The Issuer’s understanding of current HMRC
practice is that securities which are officially listed and admitted to trading on the Official List of the Exchange
may be regarded as “listed on a recognised stock exchange” for this purpose.

In all cases falling outside the exemption described above, interest on the Notes may fall to be paid under
deduction of UK income tax at the basic rate (currently 20%) subject to such relief as may be available following
a direction from HMRC pursuant to the provisions of any applicable double taxation treaty (a “Treaty”), or to
any other exemption which may apply.

**_Payments by a Guarantor_**

Depending on the correct legal analysis of payments made by a Guarantor as a matter of UK tax law, it is
possible that payments by a Guarantor would be subject to withholding on account of UK tax, subject to any
applicable exemptions or reliefs (and noting that the exemption and relief set out above would not necessarily be
applicable).

**_Other rules relating to withholding or deductions on account of UK income tax_**

Where Notes are to be, or may fall to be, redeemed at a premium any such element of premium may
constitute a payment of interest. In certain cases, the same could be true for amounts of discount where Notes are
issued at a discount. Payments of interest are subject to withholding or deduction on account of UK income tax
as outlined above.

Where interest has been paid under deduction of UK income tax, holders of the Notes who are not resident
in the UK for tax purposes may be able to recover all or part of the tax deducted if there is an appropriate
provision in any applicable double taxation treaty.

157


-----

The references to “interest” and “principal” in the statements above mean interest and principal (as
applicable) as understood in UK tax law. The statements above do not take any account of any different
definitions of interest or principal which may prevail under any other law or which may be created by the terms
and conditions of the Notes or any related documentation. Holders of the Notes should seek their own
professional advice as regards the withholding tax treatment of any payment on the Notes which does not
constitute interest or principal as those terms are understood in UK tax law.

The above description of the UK income tax position assumes that there will be no substitution, merger,
consolidation or amalgamation of an Issuer and does not consider the tax consequences of any such substitution,
merger, consolidation or amalgamation.

**Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax**

No stamp duty or stamp duty reserve tax is payable on the issue or transfer of the Notes.

**The Proposed Financial Transaction Tax (“FTT”)**

On February 14, 2013, the European Commission published a proposal (the “Commission’s Proposal”) for
a Directive for a common FTT in Belgium, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Italy, Austria, Portugal,
Slovenia and Slovakia (the “participating Member States”). However, Estonia has since stated that it will not
participate.

The Commission’s Proposal has very broad scope and could, if introduced, apply to certain dealings in the
Notes (including secondary market transactions) in certain circumstances.

Under the Commission’s Proposal the FTT could apply in certain circumstances to persons both within and
outside of the participating Member States. Generally, it would apply to certain dealings in the Notes where at
least one party is a financial institution, and at least one party is established in a participating Member State. A
financial institution may be, or be deemed to be, “established” in a participating Member State in a broad range
of circumstances, including (a) by transacting with a person established in a participating Member State, or
(b) where the financial instrument which is subject to the dealings is issued in a participating Member State.

However, the FTT proposal remains subject to negotiation between participating Member States. It may
therefore be altered prior to any implementation, the timing of which remains unclear. Additional EU Member
States may decide to participate.

Prospective holders of the Notes are advised to seek their own professional advice in relation to the FTT.

**FATCA**

Pursuant to certain provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, commonly known as “FATCA”,
a “foreign financial institution” may be required to withhold on certain payments it makes (“foreign passthru
**payments”) to persons that fail to meet certain certification, reporting, or related requirements. The Issuer may**
be a foreign financial institution for these purposes. A number of jurisdictions (including the UK) have entered
into, or have agreed in substance to, intergovernmental agreements with the United States to implement FATCA
(“IGAs”), which modify the way in which FATCA applies in their jurisdictions. Certain aspects of the
application of the FATCA provisions and IGAs to instruments such as the Notes, including whether withholding
would ever be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the
Notes, are uncertain and may be subject to change. Even if withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or
an IGA with respect to payments on instruments such as the Notes, such withholding would not apply prior to
January 1, 2019, and Notes issued on or prior to the date that is six months after the date on which final
regulations defining “foreign passthru payments” are filed with the U.S. Federal Register generally would be
“grandfathered” for purposes of FATCA withholding, unless materially modified after such date. Holders of the
Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding how these rules may apply to their investment in the
Notes. In the event any withholding would be required pursuant to FATCA or an IGA with respect to payments
on the Notes, no person will be required to pay additional amounts as a result of the withholding.

**CERTAIN INSOLVENCY AND ENFORCEABILITY CONSIDERATIONS**

_The following is a summary of certain insolvency and other legal considerations in England and Wales,_
_where the Issuer and each Guarantor is incorporated, and a summary of certain limitations on the validity and_
_enforceability of the Guarantees. The description is only a summary and does not purport to be complete or to_
_discuss all of the limitations or considerations that may affect the validity or enforceability of the Notes or the_
_Guarantees. In addition, the laws of more than one jurisdiction could potentially apply in respect of certain_
_matters and laws in multiple jurisdictions could result in disputes over which jurisdiction’s law should apply,_
_which could adversely affect your rights and your ability to enforce your rights and collect payment in full under_
_the Notes or the Guarantees. Prospective investors in the Notes should consult their own legal advisors with_
_respect to all such limitations and considerations._

**EUROPEAN UNION**

Whilst the Issuer and the Guarantors are companies incorporated under the laws of England and Wales and
the Issuer’s and the Guarantors’ registered offices are also located in England and Wales, pursuant to Council
Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of May 29, 2000 on insolvency proceedings (as amended) (the “EU Insolvency
**Regulation”), the court which has jurisdiction to open main insolvency proceedings in relation to a company is**
the court of the Member State (in this section references to Member States exclude Denmark) in which that
company has its “centre of main interests” (“COMI”). There is a rebuttable presumption that a company’s COMI
is in the place where it registered office is located and so, unless this presumption was rebutted (about which see
further below), any main insolvency proceedings in respect of the Issuer or the Guarantors would be commenced
in England and conducted in accordance with the requirements of English insolvency law. The forms of
insolvency proceedings which can comprise main proceedings are listed in Annex A to the EU Insolvency
Regulation and include, in respect of the UK, administration, compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary
liquidation with confirmation by the court (see further “—England and Wales—Administration” and “—England
_and Wales—Liquidation/Winding-Up.”)_

It is possible to rebut the presumption that a company’s COMI is in the place of its registered office if
factors which are both objective and ascertainable by third parties (meaning that they are already in the public
domain and what a typical third party would learn as a result of dealing with the company, without making
specific enquiries) indicate that the company’s COMI is elsewhere (Re Eurofood IFSC Ltd ECJ C-341/2004).
Factors which may be taken into account include the location of any regulatory authorities and the places where
the company’s business is managed and operated, board meetings held and the accounts prepared and audited.
Where the bodies responsible for the management and supervision of a company are in the same place as its
registered office, and where the management decisions of the company are taken from there, the presumption
cannot be rebutted (Interedil Srl (in liquidation) v Fallimento Interedil Srl and another C-396/09). The point at
which a company’s COMI falls to be determined is at the time that the relevant insolvency proceedings are
opened.

Insolvency proceedings opened in one Member State under the EU Insolvency Regulation are to be
recognised in other Member States, although secondary proceedings may additionally be opened in any Member
State where the company has an “establishment.” An establishment is a place of operations where a company
carries out non-transitory economic activities with human means and goods (Article 2(h) of the EU Insolvency
Regulation). This means a fixed place of business and dealings with third parties (as opposed to purely internal
administration). The effect of secondary proceedings is limited to the assets located in that Member State. The
forms of insolvency proceedings which can comprise secondary proceedings are listed in Annex B to the EU
Insolvency Regulation and include, in respect of the UK, compulsory liquidation and creditors’ voluntary
liquidation with confirmation by the court but not administration.

The EU Insolvency Regulation contains provisions dealing with the co-ordination of main and secondary
proceedings.

The EU Insolvency Regulation has been replaced by the Regulation (EU) 2015/848 of the European
Parliament and of the Council dated May 20, 2015 (the “New EU Insolvency Regulation”), which became
effective as of June 26, 2015, and which will be applicable to insolvency proceedings opened after June 26, 2017
(subject to certain exceptions). The EU Insolvency Regulation remains applicable to insolvency proceedings
opened before that date.

The New EU Insolvency Regulation, among other matters, codifies case law regarding the identification of
the center of main interests. Pursuant to Article 3(1) of the New EU Insolvency Regulation, in the case of a
company or legal person, the center of main interests is presumed to be located in the country of the registered

159


-----

office in the absence of proof to the contrary. That presumption shall only apply if the registered office has not
been moved to another member state within the three-month period prior to the request for the opening of
insolvency proceedings. Specifically, the presumption of the center of main interests being at the place of the
registered office should be rebuttable if the company’s central administration is located in a member state other
than the one where it has its registered office, and where a comprehensive assessment of all the relevant factors
establishes, in a manner that is ascertainable by third parties, that the company’s actual center of management
and supervision and the center of the management of its interests is located in that other member state. In this
regard, special consideration should be given to creditors and their perception as to where a debtor conducts the
administration of its interests. In the event of a shift in the center of main interests, this may require informing
the creditors of the new location from which the debtor is carrying out its activities in due course (e.g., by
drawing attention to the change of address in commercial correspondence or otherwise making the new location
public through other appropriate means). Another change under the New EU Insolvency Regulation focuses on
the definition of “establishment” as a prerequisite to open “territorial proceedings” (secondary proceedings).
From June 26, 2017 onwards, “establishment” will mean any place of operations where a debtor carries out or
has carried out in the three-month period prior to the request to open main insolvency proceedings a
non-transitory economic activity with human means and assets. At this stage, it is not possible to conclusively
determine what (if any) impact there might be in relation to the Notes.

It remains to be seen what impact the recent vote by the UK to leave the EU will have on the regulatory
environment in the EU and the UK and on the applicability of EU law in the UK.

**ENGLAND AND WALES**

English insolvency law is different to the laws of the United States and other jurisdictions with which
investors may be familiar. In the event that the Issuer or Guarantors experience financial difficulty, it is not
possible to predict with certainty the outcome of insolvency or similar proceedings. Formal insolvency
proceedings under the laws of England and Wales may be initiated in a number of ways, as follows.

**Administration**

There are two distinct methods for placing a company into administration: (i) an application to court
following by a court order for administration (the “in-court route”); or (ii) the filing of certain prescribed forms
with the court following which the administration takes effect (the “out-of-court route”). The in-court route is
commenced by an application to court by the company itself, a majority of its directors, one or more of its
creditors including contingent or prospective creditors, the Financial Conduct Authority or the Prudential
Regulation Authority or certain other designated persons. The out-of-court method of appointment is available
only to the directors, the company itself and the holder of a qualifying floating charge (“QFC”) (see further
below for the meaning of this term). No physical court hearing is required and the administrator’s appointment
takes effect when the court stamps receipt of the relevant forms.

A QFC is defined in paragraph 14 of Schedule B1 to the Insolvency Act 1986 (the “IA86”) as being a
floating charge created by an instrument which either: (i) states on its face that paragraph 14 applies to it; or
(ii) purports to empower the holder of the floating charge to appoint an administrative receiver or an
administrator of the company. A person is the holder of a QFC if he holds one or more debentures of the
company secured by charges and other forms of security, which together relate to the whole or substantially the
whole of the company’s property and at least one of which is a qualifying floating charge.

When any person other than a holder of a QFC makes an administration appointment (whether by the
in-court or out-of-court route), it will be necessary to show that the company is, or is likely to become, unable to
pay its debts (see “—The Insolvency test”). Regardless of how an administrator is appointed, he will need to
consent to act as administrator and to state that, in his opinion, one of the following statutory objectives can be
satisfied (the second objective can only be considered if the first objective cannot be satisfied and similarly for
the third objective): (i) to rescue the company as a going concern; (ii) to achieve a better result for creditors as a
whole than would be likely if the company were wound up without first being in administration; or (iii) to realise
property to make a distribution to one or more secured or preferential creditors (see “—Statutory order of
_priorities”)._

An interim moratorium takes effect when an application to appoint an administrator is made or a notice of
intention to appoint an administrator is filed at court. This becomes final once the company is in administration.
The moratorium means, among other things, that no other legal process (including legal proceedings, execution,
distress or diligence) may be commenced or continued against the company and no step can be taken to enforce

160


-----

security over the company’s property (in each case except with the consent of the administrator or the permission
of the court), no administrative receiver can be appointed and, except in certain limited circumstances, no
resolution can be passed or order be made for the winding-up of the company. This moratorium does not apply to
financial collateral that has been created under a financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of the
Financial Collateral Arrangements (No. 2) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/3226) (as amended) (the “Financial
**Collateral Regulations”) (generally, such arrangements are in respect of cash or financial instruments, such as**
shares, bonds or tradable capital market debt instruments).

An administrator owes his duties to the creditors of the company as a whole. Upon appointment, he takes
control of the day-to-day running of the company and takes custody or control of all property, to which he thinks
the company is entitled. He has broad powers to deal with the company and its assets, except in respect of assets
which are subject to fixed charge security. The permission of the court is required to dispose of any such fixed
charge assets and the proceeds of sale must be paid to the fixed charge holder. An administrator’s powers further
extend to investigating why the company failed and, where appropriate, bringing actions against the directors or
former directors or seeking to set aside certain transactions (see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws” in respect of
the latter).

An administration does not itself terminate any contracts and, unlike a liquidator, an administrator does not
have the power to disclaim or terminate contracts (although he can choose to breach a contract if he considers it
to be in the best interests of the creditors as a whole, in which case the resulting damages will rank as an
unsecured debt, see “—Statutory order of priorities”). Conversely, contractual terms providing for automatic
termination or a right of termination by the counterparty upon the occurrence of an insolvency event (such as
administration) will generally be enforceable as they are not considered to be against public policy as a matter of
English law. However, there are exceptions to this general approach, most notably in the context of contractual
supplies of services considered essential for the conduct of the administration. As of October 1, 2015,
counterparties may not terminate these contracts (or the supplies they govern) simply because the company
enters administration, except with the consent of the administrator or the permission of the court.

**Administrative receivership**

Section 72A(1) of the IA86 (which was introduced by the Enterprise Act 2002) imposes a general
prohibition on the appointment of administrative receivers subject to limited exceptions set out in sections 72B to
72GA, none of which are relevant in the context of the Offering. The remedy for the holder of a QFC is instead
to appoint an administrator (see “—Administration”).

**Liquidation/Winding-Up**

Liquidation is a terminal insolvency process pursuant to which the assets of a company are realised by the
liquidator and the proceeds distributed to creditors in accordance with a statutory order of priority (see
“—Statutory order of priorities”), with any surplus paid to the shareholders. Once the liquidator has completed
this task, the company will be dissolved and removed from the register of companies.

There are two different types of liquidation: (i) compulsory; and (ii) voluntary, which is in turn divided into
members’ voluntary liquidation (“MVL”) and creditors’ voluntary liquidation (“CVL”).

Regardless of how he is appointed, a liquidator owes his duties to the company and its creditors as a whole
and has wide powers to do whatever necessary for the conduct of the liquidation. This includes the power to:
(i) agree, compromise and pay creditor claims; (ii) sell any of the company’s property; (iii) bring or defend any
legal proceedings on behalf of the company; (iv) disclaim onerous property or contracts in accordance with
section 178 of the IA86; (v) bring actions against the directors or former directors; and (vi) bring actions to set
aside certain transactions (see “—Antecedent Transaction Laws” in respect of the latter).

In a compulsory liquidation, there is an automatic stay on proceedings being commenced or continued
against the company or its property except with the permission of the court. In a voluntary liquidation, there is no
such automatic stay although the court may, upon the application of the liquidator or any creditor, order a stay
under its general discretionary power in section 112 of the IA86.

**_Compulsory liquidation_**

Compulsory liquidation is a court-based procedure pursuant to which a creditor petitions for the winding up
of a company and the court makes a winding up order. The grounds which entitle the court to make a winding up
order are set out in section 122 of the IA86. The most common grounds are that: (i) the company is unable to pay
its debts (see “—The Insolvency Test” for the meaning of this term); and (ii) it is just and equitable for the
company to be wound up.

161


-----

Under section 127 of the IA86, any disposition of the company’s property, any transfer of the company’s
shares and any altering of the status of company members is void if made following the “commencement of a
winding up”, unless the court orders otherwise. If a winding up order is made, it is deemed to have commenced
on the date on which the winding up petition was presented. This gives section 127 retrospective effect, meaning
that the company cannot enter into any of the specified transactions during the period between the presentation of
a winding up petition and the making of a winding up order without first seeking a validation order from the
court.

**_Members’ voluntary liquidation_**

An MVL is a solvent liquidation that is controlled by the shareholders. It commences when the shareholders
pass a special resolution to place the company into liquidation and there is no involvement by the court.

Not more than five weeks prior to the making of the winding up resolution, the directors must swear a
statutory declaration of solvency stating that, after making full enquiry into the company’s affairs, they have
formed the opinion that it will be able to pay its debts, including interest and the costs of the MVL process,
within a stated period not exceeding 12 months from the start of the liquidation.

**_Creditors’ voluntary liquidation_**

A creditors’ voluntary liquidation is also commenced by the shareholders resolving to place the company
into liquidation and has no court involvement. In contrast to an MVL, however, the directors do not swear a
statutory declaration of solvency for a CVL (meaning the company can be solvent or insolvent) and, after the
shareholders’ meeting, a creditors’ meeting must also resolve to place the company into liquidation. If the
creditors choose a different person to act as liquidator from the shareholders, the creditors’ choice will prevail.

**The Insolvency Test**

The IA86 has no test for or definition of insolvency per se, but instead relies on the concept of a company’s
“inability to pay its debts” as the keystone for many of its provisions. Pursuant to section 123 of the IA86, the
circumstances in which a company is deemed unable to pay its debts include, among others, the following: (i) if a
creditor to whom the company is indebted in a sum exceeding £750 then due has served a statutory demand on
the company requiring the company to pay the sum so due and the company has failed for three weeks to pay,
secure or compound the sum; (ii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the company is unable to pay
its debts as they fall due; or (iii) if it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the value of the company’s
assets is less than the amount of its liabilities, taking into account its contingent and prospective liabilities.

**Statutory order of priorities**

A liquidator or administrator will need to comply with the following statutory order of priority when he
distributes the proceeds of realised assets to a company’s creditors: (i) proceeds of realisations from assets
subject to a fixed charge are paid to the fixed charge holder (less any costs of realisation); (ii) expenses of the
liquidation or the administration, which includes monies arising under a contract entered into by the
administrator or liquidator, or any necessary disbursements made in the ordinary insolvency process;
(iii) ordinary preferential debts, being contributions to occupational pension schemes, employment claims (up to
a certain statutory maximum) and bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme (“FSCS”) up to the statutory limit; (iv) secondary preferential debts,
being bank and building society deposits eligible for compensation under the FSCS to the extent that the claims
exceed the statutory limit, and deposits made through a non-EEA branch of a credit institution that would
otherwise have been eligible for FSCS compensation); (v) the prescribed part, which is a ring fenced amount of
money that the administrator or liquidator must set aside from realisations from floating charge property to
distribute to unsecured creditors—calculated as 50% of the first £10,000 of net realisations and 20% of the net
realisations thereafter, up to a maximum of £600,000; (vi) proceeds of floating charge asset realisations (less any
costs of realisation, the preferential debts and the prescribed part); (vii) provable debts of unsecured creditors
(these rank equally among themselves, unless there are subordination agreements in place between any of them);
(viii) statutory interest that arises on debts after the insolvency at either the contractual or a statutory rate; and
(ix) non-provable liabilities, being liabilities that do not fall within any of the categories above and which are
therefore only recovered in the (unusual) event that all categories above are fully paid.

Any surplus will be paid to the shareholders in accordance with the company’s articles of association. There
are no equitable subordination provisions under English law, meaning that an unsecured shareholder loan ranks
as a provable debt alongside other unsecured creditors and will not be subordinated by law.

162


-----

In administration or liquidation, any debt payable in a currency other than pounds sterling must be
converted into pounds sterling at the ‘‘official exchange rate’’ (which is defined from time to time in the
subordinate legislation of the IA86) prevailing at the date when the company went into liquidation or
administration. This provision overrides any agreement between the parties.

Assets held on trust by the company generally fall outside the insolvent estate that is available for
distribution.

**Schemes of arrangement**

Pursuant to Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 the English courts have jurisdiction to sanction the
compromise of a company’s liabilities where such company (i) is liable to be wound-up under the IA86 and
(ii) has “sufficient connection” to the English jurisdiction.

Before the court considers the sanction of a scheme of arrangement, affected creditors will vote on a
detailed debt compromise. Such compromise can be proposed by the company or (theoretically) its creditors. If at
least 75% by number and 50% by value of those creditors present and voting at the creditor meeting(s) vote in
favour of the proposed compromise, irrespective of the terms and approval thresholds contained in the finance
documents, that compromise will be binding on all affected creditors, including those affected creditors who did
not participate in the vote on the scheme of arrangement and those who voted against the scheme of arrangement.
In certain circumstances, a scheme of arrangement can also result in the release of guarantees in order to ensure
the effectiveness of the compromise.

**Antecedent Transaction Laws**

There are five principal provisions of the IA86 under which transactions entered into prior to a company’s
insolvency are capable of being set aside. They are: (i) transactions at an undervalue (section 238); (ii)
preferences (section 239); (iii) avoidance of certain floating charges (section 245); (iv) transactions defrauding
creditors (section 423); and (v) extortionate credit transactions (section 244).

These provisions all apply where the company has gone into liquidation or administration, with the
exception of section 423 which applies even if the company is not in insolvency proceedings.

**_Transactions at an undervalue_**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into a transaction at an undervalue,
the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction will constitute a transaction at an undervalue if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (a gift or
a transaction on terms that provide for the company to receive no consideration or a transaction for a
consideration the value of which (in money or money’s worth) is significantly less than the value (in money or
money’s worth) of the consideration provided by the company); (ii) the transaction took place within the relevant
time (2 years before the onset of insolvency, being broadly the commencement of its liquidation or
administration); and (iii) the company was at the time of the transaction, or became, as a result of the transaction,
unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of the IA86 (although there is a rebuttable presumption
that the company was unable to pay its debts at the time of the transaction if the transaction is made to a person
connected to the company such as a shareholder or a director (a “connected person”)).

The court will not make an order in respect of a transaction at an undervalue if it is satisfied that: (i) the
company which entered into the transaction did so in good faith and for the purposes of carrying on its business;
and (ii) when it did so, there were reasonable grounds for believing that the transaction would benefit the
company.

**_Preferences_**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has granted a preference the court may, on the
application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A company gives a preference to a person if: (i) that person is one of the company’s creditors, a surety or a
guarantor for any of the company’s debts or other liabilities; (ii) the company has done something, or has
suffered something to be done which (in either case) has had the effect of putting that person into a position
which, in the event that the company goes into insolvent liquidation, will be better than the position he would
have been in if that thing had not been done; (iii) the company was influenced in deciding to give the preference

163


-----

by a desire to put the creditor in a better position than he would have been in if the thing had not been done or
suffered to be done (this desire is rebuttably presumed in the case of connected persons); (iv) the preference was
given within the relevant time (6 months before the onset of the insolvency or 2 years from the onset of
insolvency where the transaction is with a connected person); and (v) the company was at the time of the
transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within the meaning of section 123 of
the IA86.

The desire to prefer requires a “positive wish to improve the creditor’s position in the event of [the
company’s] insolvent liquidation” (Re Fairway Managaines Ltd [1993] BCLC 643. A preferential effect for a
creditor may be foreseen by the company without being desired. Where a company is influenced by “proper
commercial considerations” there will be no desire to prefer and therefore no voidable preference (MC Bacon

[1990] BCLC 324).

**_Voidable floating charges_**

A floating charge created by a company over its property may be invalid if it was created in the relevant
time. Where the transaction is with a connected person, this means within a period of 2 years before the onset of
insolvency. In all other cases, this means within a period of 12 months before the onset on insolvency when the
company was at the time of the transaction, or became as a result of the transaction, unable to pay its debts within
the meaning of section 123 of the IA86.

This is the only requirement for setting aside the floating charge and, if met, the security is automatically
invalid except to the extent of the aggregate of the value of so much of the consideration for the creation of the
charge (as consists of money paid, goods or services supplied or debts discharged and interest thereon) supplied
to the company at the time of, or after the creation of, the charge. No court action is required.

Section 245 of the IA86 does not apply to a floating charge that has been created under a financial collateral
arrangement within the meaning of the Financial Collateral Regulations.

**_Transactions defrauding creditors_**

A transaction entered into by a company can be set aside if: (i) the transaction is at an undervalue (see
above); and (ii) it was entered into for the purpose of putting assets beyond the reach of a person who may make
a claim against the company or otherwise prejudicing his interests.

It is not necessary for the company to be in insolvency proceedings and unlike a transaction at an
undervalue or a preference, the claim is not restricted to the officeholder. The victim of the transaction can apply
to the court himself. The IA86 also does not prescribe a set time limit within which to bring the action. The fact
that the transaction was not entered into with a dishonest motive is no defence to the claim. It will suffice that the
company’s subjective purpose was to place the assets out of the reach of creditors or a particular creditor. There
is no need to show that the intention was the sole purpose and a substantial purpose is likely to suffice.

**_Extortionate credit transactions_**

If a company goes into administration or liquidation and it has entered into an extortionate credit
transaction, the court may, on the application of the insolvency officeholder, set the transaction aside.

A transaction is extortionate if, having regard to the risk accepted by the person providing the credit, either:
(i) its terms require grossly exorbitant payments to be made (whether unconditionally or in certain contingencies)
in respect of the provision of the credit; or (ii) it otherwise grossly contravenes ordinary principles of fair dealing.

The court can make an order in relation to extortionate credit transactions entered into by the company up to
three years before the day on which the company entered into administration or went into liquidation (which is
slightly different to the concept of the onset of insolvency used in relation to transactions at an undervalue and
preferences).

**Orders**

In the case of any of the above applying and where a court order is required (i.e., not section 245 of the
IA86), the court has very wide statutory powers to make such orders as it thinks fit to restore the position to that
which existed before the transaction was entered into.

**_Maintenance of capital_**

The granting of upstream (or cross-stream) guarantees or security by an English company could be subject
to challenge if it results in a reduction in that company’s net assets as properly recorded in its books or, to the
extent that it does, the company does not have sufficient distributable reserves to cover that reduction.

**Additional considerations**

**_Post-petition interest_**

Any interest accruing under or in respect of amounts due under the Notes or any English Guarantee to which
an English company is a party in respect of any period after the commencement of administration or liquidation
proceedings would only be recoverable by the holders of the Notes from any surplus remaining after payment of
all other debts proved in the English company’s insolvency proceedings and accrued and unpaid interest up to the
date of the commencement of those proceedings provided that such interest may, if there are sufficient
realizations from the secured assets, be discharged out of such security recoveries.

**_Dispositions in winding-up_**

Under section 127 of the IA86, any dispositions of a company’s property made after a winding-up has
commenced is, unless the court orders otherwise, void. The compulsory winding-up of a company by the court is
deemed to start when a winding-up petition is presented by a creditor against the company, rather than the date
on which the court makes the winding-up order (if any). However, this will not apply to any property or security
interest subject to a disposition or otherwise arising under a financial collateral arrangement under the Financial
Collateral Arrangements Regulations and will not prevent a close-out netting provision taking effect in
accordance with its terms.

**PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION**

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) to be
dated as of the date of this offering memorandum, the Issuer has agreed to sell to each Initial Purchaser, and each
such Initial Purchaser has agreed, severally and not jointly, to purchase the Notes, from the Issuer. The Initial
Purchasers are Barclays Bank PLC, HSBC Bank plc, The Royal Bank of Scotland plc (trading as NatWest
Markets), Banco Santander SA, Bank of China Limited London Branch, BNP Paribas, Cre´dit Industriel et
Commercial S.A., Credit Suisse Securities (Europe) Limited, DNB Markets, a division of DNB Bank ASA and
MUFG Securities EMEA plc.

The Purchase Agreement provides that the obligations of the Initial Purchasers to pay for and accept
delivery of the Notes are subject to, among other conditions, the delivery of certain legal opinions by counsel.

The Initial Purchasers propose to offer the Notes initially at the price indicated on the cover page hereof.
After the initial offering, the offering price and other selling terms of the Notes may from time to time be varied
by the Initial Purchasers without notice. The Initial Purchasers may offer and sell Notes through certain of their
affiliates.

Persons who purchase Notes from the Initial Purchasers may be required to pay stamp duty, taxes and other
charges in accordance with the laws and practice of the country of purchase in addition to the offering price set
forth on the cover page hereof.

The Purchase Agreement provides that we will indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchasers against
certain liabilities, including liabilities under the U.S. Securities Act, and will contribute to payments that the
Initial Purchasers may be required to make in respect thereof. We have agreed, subject to certain limited
exceptions, not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of, except as provided under the Purchase
Agreement, any debt securities issued or guaranteed by the Issuer or the Guarantors that are substantially similar
to the Notes and having a tenor of more than one year during the period from the date of the Purchase Agreement
through and including the date that is 90 days after the date of the Purchase Agreement.

The Notes and Guarantees have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities Act. The Initial
Purchasers have agreed that they will only offer or sell the Notes outside the United States in offshore
transactions in accordance with Regulation S. Terms used in this paragraph have the meanings given to them by
Regulation S.

Each Initial Purchaser has represented, warranted and agreed with us that:

(1) it has only communicated or caused to be communicated and will only communicate or cause to be
communicated any invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity, within the meaning of
Section 21 of the FSMA, received by it in connection with the issue or sale of any Notes in
circumstances in which Section 21(1) of the FSMA does not apply to us, and

(2) it has complied and will comply with all applicable provisions of the FSMA with respect to anything
done by it in relation to the Notes in, from or otherwise involving the United Kingdom.

No action has been taken in any jurisdiction, including the United Kingdom, by us or the Initial Purchasers
that would permit a public offering of the Notes or the possession, circulation or distribution of this offering
memorandum or any other material relating to us or the Notes in any jurisdiction where action for this purpose is
required. Accordingly, the Notes and the Guarantees may not be offered or sold, directly or indirectly, and
neither this offering memorandum nor any other offering material or advertisements in connection with the Notes
and the Guarantees may be distributed or published, in or from any country or jurisdiction, except in compliance
with any applicable rules and regulations of any such country or jurisdiction. This offering memorandum does
not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to purchase in any jurisdiction where such offer or
solicitation would be unlawful. Persons into whose possession this offering memorandum comes are advised to
inform themselves about and to observe any restrictions relating to the Offering, the distribution of this offering
memorandum and resale of the Notes. See “Notice to Investors.”

The Notes are a new issue of securities for which there currently is no market. We will apply, through our
listing sponsor, to list the Notes on the Official List of the Exchange and trade them thereon. The Official List of
the Exchange is an exchange regulated market and not a regulated market for the purposes of Directive
2004/39/EC. There is no assurance that the Notes will be listed and admitted to trading on the Official List of the
Exchange or that any such listing or admission will be maintained.

The Initial Purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes as permitted by
applicable law. The Initial Purchasers are not obligated, however, to make a market in the Notes, and any marketmaking activity may be discontinued at any time at the sole discretion of the Initial Purchasers without notice. In

166


-----

addition, any such market-making activity will be subject to the limits imposed by applicable law, and may be
limited. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that any market for the Notes will develop, that it will be liquid if it
does develop, or that you will be able to sell any Notes at a particular time or at a price that will be favourable to
you. See “Risk Factors—Risks relating to the Notes and the Guarantees—There is no established trading market
_for the Notes and no assurance that the holders of the Notes will be able to sell them.”_

In connection with the offering of the Notes, the Stabilizing Manager or one or more of its affiliates or
persons acting on its behalf may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, overallot the Notes or effect
transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might
otherwise prevail. However, there is no assurance that the Stabilizing Manager will undertake stabilization
action. Any stabilization action, if commenced, may begin on or after the date on which adequate public
disclosure of the terms of the offering of the Notes is made and may be ended at any time, but it must end no
later than 30 days after the issue date, or no later than 60 days after the date of the allotment of the Notes,
whichever is earlier. Any stabilization action or over-allotment must be conducted by the Stabilizing Manager (or
persons acting on its behalf) in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and rules.

Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates have engaged, and may in the future engage, in
investment banking and/or commercial banking transactions with, and may perform services for the Issuer, the
Guarantors and their respective affiliates in the ordinary course of business. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and
their affiliates may have positions, deal or make markets in the Notes, related derivatives and reference
obligations, including (but not limited to) entering into hedging strategies on behalf of the Issuer, the Guarantors
and their respective affiliates, investor clients, or as principal in order to manage their exposure, their general
market risk, or other trading activities.

In addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may
make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative
securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their
customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Issuer, the
Guarantors or their respective affiliates. The Initial Purchasers or their respective affiliates may also receive
allocations of the Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with
the Issuer or the Guarantors and routinely hedge their credit exposure to the Issuer or the Guarantors (as the case
may be) consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such Initial Purchasers and their
affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions, which consist of either the purchase of credit
default swaps or the creation of short positions in securities, including potentially the Notes. Any such positions
could adversely affect future trading prices of Notes. Certain of the Initial Purchasers and their affiliates may also
make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such
securities or financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short
positions in such securities and instruments. In particular, certain of the Initial Purchasers or their affiliates act as
arrangers, lenders or other counterparties to certain of our financing arrangements, for which they have received,
or may in the future receive, customary fees, commissions and payments.

### Notes to the interim condensed consolidated financial statements

 1. Basis of preparation

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act
2006. The Company’s shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The registered office of the Company is
11 Evesham Street, London W11 4AR.

This half-year report has been prepared in accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the United
Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority; IAS 34 ‘Interim Financial Reporting’ as adopted by the European Union;
on the basis of the accounting policies and the recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS applied in the
consolidated financial statements at 31 March 2016 and those standards that have been endorsed by the European
Union and will be applied at 31 March 2017. This report should be read in conjunction with the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016.

The results for each half year are unaudited and do not represent the Group’s statutory accounts within the
meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The interim financial information has been reviewed by
Deloitte LLP, not audited. The Group’s statutory accounts were approved by the Directors on 12 May 2016 and
have been reported on by Deloitte LLP and delivered to the Registrar of Companies. The report of Deloitte LLP
was (i) unqualified, (ii) did not include a reference to any matters to which the auditors drew attention by way of
emphasis without qualifying their report and (iii) did not contain a statement under section 498 of the Companies
Act 2006.

**Going concern**

Based on internal forecasts and projections, the Directors consider that the Group has adequate financial
resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the
going concern basis in preparing the Group’s interim condensed consolidated financial statements.

### 2. Accounting policies

The interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the 6 months ended 30 September 2016 have been
prepared using accounting policies and methods of computation consistent with those set out in the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016. There are no new or revised standards and interpretations
that have had a material impact on the Group during the period.

**Income tax**

Income tax in the interim period is accrued using the tax rate that would be applicable to the expected annual
profit or loss.

**Future accounting developments**

At the date of authorisation of these interim condensed consolidated financial statements, there were a number of
significant standards and interpretations that have not been applied in these financial statements, these were in
issue, but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU).

The Directors expect that the following standards will have material impact on the financial statements of the
Group in future periods:

- IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, impacting the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments. The
effective date of this standard for the Group is 1 April 2018.

- IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, impacting revenue recognition, related costs and
disclosures. The effective date of this standard for the Group is 1 April 2018.

 - IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, impacting lease recognition. The effective date of this standard for the Group is 1 April
2019.

Evaluation projects have commenced to review and implement these accounting developments.

Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these
standards until a detailed review has been concluded.

-----

### 3. Critical accounting judgements and estimates

The preparation of the condensed interim financial statements requires management to make judgements,
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

In preparing these condensed interim financial statements, the significant judgements made by management in
applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty were the same as those
applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2016.

### 4. Segmental reporting

IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires the segmental information presented in the financial statements to be that
used by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) to evaluate the performance of the business and decide how
to allocate resources. The Group has identified the Board as its CODM. The Board considers the results of the
business as a whole when assessing the performance of the business and making decisions about the allocation of
resources. Accordingly the Group has one operating segment with all trading operations based in the United
Kingdom.

The Group’s revenue is split by On-net, Off-net and Corporate products as this information is provided to the
Group’s CODM. On-net and Off-net comprise Consumer and Business customers that receive similar services.

### 5. Reconciliation of headline information to statutory information

Headline information is provided because the Directors consider that it provides assistance in understanding the
Group’s underlying performance.

Headline results are stated before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items. Exceptional
items are those that are considered to be one-off or non-recurring in nature and so material that the Directors
believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid distortion of the presentation of underlying performance and
should be separately presented on the face of the income statement.

The classification of items as exceptional is subjective in nature and therefore judgement is required to determine
whether the item is in line with the accounting policy criteria outlined above. Determining whether an item is
exceptional is a matter of qualitative assessment, making it distinct from the Group’s other critical accounting
judgements where the basis for judgement is estimation.

**_a) Operating efficiencies—Making TalkTalk Simpler (MTTS)_**

During the period ended 30 September 2016, the Group continued its simplification and cost reduction
programmes to drive a seamless and efficient customer experience and provide the business with operations and
processes that are fit for purpose. This wide ranging transformation programme is delivering material
improvements to our customers’ experience, driving operating cost savings, and reducing SAC through lower
churn and costs per add (CPA).

The costs incurred in the period include work on improving systems and processes which focus on customer
experience; the review of the organisational structure of the business and the sites where the Group operates.

These programmes have resulted in £10m (2015: £19m) of one-off costs being incurred, including project
management, redundancy, property, consultancy, migration and call centre costs.

A total taxation credit of £2m (2015: £3m) has been recognised on these costs.

**_b) Acquisitions and disposals_**

During the period ended 30 September 2016, the Group incurred further exceptional costs of £1m in relation to
the disposal of the off-net customer base in the prior period.

During the period ended 30 September 2015, the Group recognised net exceptional income of £2m in relation to
the prior year acquisitions and disposals of Virgin Media (£3m exceptional income) and the off-net broadband
customer base (£1m exceptional charge) respectively.

The tax impact was £nil (2015: £nil)

**_c) Amortisation of acquisition intangibles_**

An amortisation charge in respect of acquisition intangibles of £5m was incurred in the period ended
30 September 2016 (2015: £5m). A total taxation credit of £nil (2015: £1m) has been recognised on these costs.

### 7. Taxation

The taxation charge of £11m (2015: £3m) reflects an effective tax rate of 24% (2015: 20%) on headline profits
before taxation of £46m (2015: £14m), representing the best estimate of the average annual effective tax rate
expected for the full year, applied to the six month period. The effective rate of tax has increased from the prior
year due to a decrease in deferred tax derived from the utilisation of tax losses and a change in tax rates to 17%.

### 10. Other intangible assets

**Operating intangibles**

Operating intangibles include internal infrastructure and design costs incurred in the development of software for
internal use. Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately
identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, and the development cost can be
measured reliably. Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in
the year in which it is incurred. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised include employee costs specifically
incurred in the development of the intangible asset. Operating intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis
over their estimated useful economic lives of up to eight years.

**Non-operating intangibles**

Non-operating intangible assets such as customer bases and other intangible assets acquired through a business
combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and amortised over their expected useful lives of up to six
years on a straight line basis. The value attributed to such assets is based on the future economic benefit that is
expected to be derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash flows after a deduction for
contributory assets.

**Borrowing facilities**

The Group’s committed facilities total £994m (2015: £704m, March 2016: £944m). The Group’s uncommitted
facilities total £111m (2015: £81m, March 2016: £81m) giving headroom on committed facilities and
uncommitted facilities of £162m and £96m respectively. The financial covenants included in each facility are
identical; they restrict the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and require minimum levels of interest cover. The
amounts used in the covenant calculations are subject to adjustments as defined under the terms of the banking
arrangement. The Group was in compliance with its covenants throughout the current and prior periods.

F-15


-----

Details of the borrowing facilities of the Group as at 30 September 2016 are set out below:

**$185m USPP Notes**

In July 2014, the Group issued $185m of USPP Notes maturing in three tranches ($139m in 2021, $25m in 2024
and $21m in 2026). The interest rate payable on the notes is at a margin over US treasury rate for the appropriate
period. The USPP proceeds were swapped to Sterling to give £109m (£82m in 2021, £15m in 2024 and £12m in
2026) and the net debt includes retranslation of the USPP funds at the rates achieved where hedged by crosscurrency swaps. The fair value of the cross currency rate swap at 30 September 2016 was £33m (2015: £13m,
March 2016: £20m).

**£560m revolving credit facility (RCF) and £50m bilateral agreements**

The Group has a £560m RCF, which matures in July 2019. The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under
this facility is at a margin over LIBOR and for the appropriate period. The actual margin applicable to any
drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.
In addition to the RCF, the Group also has £50m of bilateral agreements, signed in July 2014 which matures in
July 2019. A second bilateral agreement of £25m signed in August 2015 has since been cancelled. The terms of
the bilateral agreement are consistent with the main RCF.

**£100m revolving credit facility (RCF)**

In January 2016, the Group signed a £100m RCF which matures in November 2017. The interest rate payable in
respect of drawings under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR and for the appropriate period. The actual
margin applicable to any drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most
recent accounting period.

**£100m term loan**

The Group has a committed term loan of £100m (2015: £100m, March 2016: £100m), with a final maturity date
of July 2019. This loan amortises over the term with repayments due of £25m in January 2017, £25m in January
2018 and the remainder in July 2019. The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under this facility is at a
margin over LIBOR for the relevant currency and for the appropriate period. The actual margin applicable to any
drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.

**Receivables purchase agreement**

In September 2016, the Group signed a £75m receivables purchase agreement which matures in September 2018
and is included within committed facilities. The Group has the ability on a rolling basis to sell its receivables in
exchange for a discounted consideration. The Group continues to consolidate the relevant receivables on the
grounds that substantially not all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred under the programme.

**Uncommitted credit facility**

In August 2016, the Group signed a £30m uncommitted credit facility secured against certain receivables.

**Bank overdrafts**

Overdraft facilities are used to assist in short term cash management; these uncommitted facilities bear interest at
a margin over the Bank of England base rate.

The underlying average credit period taken on trade payables was 40 days (2015: 35 days, March 2016:
40 days). The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair
value.

Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of past events and it is
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is considered to be
material.

Provisions are categorised as follows:

_One Company integration_

These provisions relate principally to reorganisation costs and are only recognised where plans are demonstrably
committed and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next twelve months.

_Property_

Property provisions relate to dilapidations and similar property costs, and costs associated with onerous property
contracts. All such provisions are assessed by reference to the terms and conditions of the contract and market
conditions at the balance sheet date. Onerous property contracts are expected to be utilised over the next seven
years. Dilapidation provisions are expected to be utilised as and when properties are exited. These provisions
include the costs of exiting our Warrington and Irlam sites, as the Group relocates to one site at the Soapworks in
Salford in April 2017.

_Contract and other_

Contract and other provisions at 30 September 2016 relate mainly to SIM replacement costs as part of the mobile
migration programme provided for in a prior year. The provisions utilised in the period ended 30 September

F-17


-----

2016, mainly relate to cash outflows associated with the cyber attack during October 2015. Other provisions
remaining are in respect of onerous contracts, contracts with unfavourable terms arising on the acquisition of
businesses and anticipated costs of unresolved legal disputes. All such provisions are assessed by reference to the
best available information at the balance sheet date.

### 16. Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments

1 Accrued income has been included within the other receivables so as to give a complete view of the Group’s future cash inflows.

2 Derivative financial instruments of £33m (2015: £13m, March 2016: £20m) relates to the USPP notes, foreign currency hedges of
(£3m) (2015: (£1m)), March 2016: (£2m) and (£2m) (2015: (£2m), March 2016: £nil) relates to interest rate hedges.

**_(a) Financial instruments_**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including market risk (such as currency risk and
interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group Treasury function uses certain financial instruments to
mitigate potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance from these risks. These financial
instruments primarily consist of bank loans and cross currency rate swaps. Other products, such as currency
options, can also be used depending on the risks to be covered, but have not been used in the current or preceding
financial year. The Group does not trade or speculate in any financial instruments.

The Group has cash flow hedges in place to (a) swap the interest rate risk on the RCF from floating to fixed and
(b) swap the currency and interest rate risk on the USPP debt from USD to GBP and from fixed US Treasury
interest rates to fixed GBP interest rates. These hedges have been fully effective from inception. The fair value
measurement is classified as Level 2 (2015: Level 2, March 2016: level 2), derived from other observable market
data; this means that their fair value is based upon the mark to market valuation at the balance sheet date. Fair
value measurement at Level 2 gives consideration to interest rates, yield curves and foreign exchange rates at
commonly quoted intervals for relevant currencies. The Group has also assessed the credit risk within its
financial instruments. The fair value of these instruments at 30 September 2016 is £28m (2015: £10m, March
2016: £18m). A loss of £2m (2015: gain £2m, March 2016: gain £2m) has been recognised in other
comprehensive income in the period ended 30 September 2016. As the hedges were fully effective there has been
no income statement impact.

**_(b) Embedded derivatives_**

No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and accordingly, no such derivatives have been
accounted for separately.

**_(c) Foreign exchange risk_**

The Group uses spot and forward foreign exchange trading to hedge transactional exposures, which arise mainly
through cost of sales and operating expenses and are primarily denominated in Euro and US Dollar. The Group

F-18


-----

also uses cross-currency swaps to hedge its US Dollar denominated borrowings (US Private Placement). At
30 September 2016, the adjustment to translate our net debt to Sterling at swap rates to reflect the impact of
hedging was £33m (2015: £13m, March 2016: £20m).

Borrowings and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates; this sensitivity
can be analysed in comparison to year-end rates. There would be no material impact of a 10% movement in the
UK Sterling/Euro or UK Sterling/USD exchange rate on either the income statement or other equity. The effect
of foreign exchange derivatives on borrowings at the year end was as follows:

**UK Sterling** **USD** **Total**
**£m** **£m** **£m**

**30 September 2016 (Unaudited)**
Borrowings before derivatives **738** **142** **880**

31 March 2016 (Audited)
Borrowings before derivatives 580 129 709
Derivatives — (20) (20)

Borrowings after derivatives 580 109 689

During the period, the Group used derivatives for the management of US Private Placement debt, foreign
currency cash balances and foreign currency trading balances.

**_(d) Interest rate risk_**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at
floating rates of interest and thus expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. These floating rates are linked
to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency. Future cash flows arising
from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods for each loan or rollover. As detailed in
section (a), the Group has cash flow hedges in place to mitigate its interest rate risk on its borrowings.

Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and
such movements have been analysed in the table below by calculating the effect on the income statement and
equity of a one percentage point movement in the interest rate for the currencies in which most Group cash and
borrowings are denominated. Funding to related parties has been offset against gross borrowings in calculating
these sensitivities. This annualised analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the year-end positions
prevail throughout the year, and therefore may not be representative of fluctuations in levels of borrowings.

**_(e) Liquidity risk_**

The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the long and short term cash flow
projections for the business against facilities and other resources available to it. Headroom is assessed based on
historical experience as well as by assessing current business risks, including foreign exchange movements.

During November 2016, the £100m RCF due to expire in May 2017 was extended to November 2017.

The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings. The amounts
disclosed in the table are the contractual undiscounted gross cash flows assuming year-end interest rates remain

**_(f) Credit risk_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored. Debt, investments, foreign exchange and derivative
transactions are all spread amongst a number of banks, all of which have short or long-term credit ratings
appropriate to the Group’s exposures. Trade receivables primarily comprise balances due from fixed line
customers, and provision is made for any receivables that are considered to be irrecoverable.

**_(g) Capital risk management_**

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern
while maximising the return to stakeholders.

F-20


-----

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 13, cash and
cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and
retained earnings. The Group’s Board reviews the capital structure on an annual basis including reviewing
opportunities to access other sources of finance including the public debt markets.

The Group uses the ratio of net debt to headline EBITDA to monitor its capital structure and has a medium-term
ratio target of 2.0x. The ratio at 30 September 2016 is 2.8x (2015: 2.8x, March 2016: 2.6x) and the Board expects
the ratio will return to its target in the medium term.

### 18. Commitments

The Group has in the normal course of business entered into various multi-year supply and working capital
agreements for core network, IT and customer equipment. As at 30 September 2016, expenditure contracted, but
not provided for in these financial statements amounted to £264m (September 2015: £362m; March 2016:
£318m). Of this amount, £52m (September 2015: £67m; March 2016: £55m) related to capital commitments and
£39m (September 2015: £nil; March 2016: £25m) related to the supply of customer equipment.

### 19. Related party transactions

Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties of the Company, have been
eliminated on consolidation, and therefore, are not required to be disclosed in these condensed interim financial
statements.

Key management compensation and transactions with the Group’s pension and post-employment schemes for the
financial year ended 31 March 2016 are detailed in note 4 (page 74) of the consolidated financial statements for
the year ended 31 March 2016. Brent Hoberman resigned as a Non-Executive Director on 20 July 2016 and
Catherine Keers was appointed as a Non-Executive Director on 1 August 2016. There have been no changes in
the composition of the Executive Committee since the year end. There have been no significant changes in the
nature of related party transactions from those described in the consolidated financial statements for the year
ended 31 March 2016.

### 20. Contingent liabilities

As at 31 March 2014, the Group had received £33m in total in relation to an Ofcom determination that BT Group
PLC (“BT”) had overcharged for certain wholesale Ethernet services. During the year ended 31 March 2015, BT
lost its appeal against Ofcom’s determination in the Competition Appeal Tribunal and appealed to the Court of
Appeal. This appeal is due to be heard in the Court of Appeal in March 2017. The Group considers the appeal is
unlikely to succeed based on the advice received and so no liability for repayment has been recorded at the year
end, although the outcome of the appeal is not yet certain.

### Independent auditor’s report to the members of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC


**Opinion on financial**
**statements of TalkTalk**
**Telecom Group PLC**

**Separate opinion in**
**relation to IFRSs as**
**issued by the IASB**

**Going concern and the**
**Directors’ assessment of**
**the principal risks that**
**would threaten the**
**solvency or liquidity of**
**the Group**


**In our opinion:**

**• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s**
**and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2016 and of the Group’s**
**profit for the year then ended;**

**• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance**
**with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the**
**European Union;**

**• the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in**
**accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in**
**accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and**

**• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the**
**requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial**
**statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.**

The financial statements comprise the Group income statement, the Group statement
of comprehensive income, the Group and Parent Company balance sheets, the Group
and Parent Company cash flow statements, the Group and Parent Company
statements of changes in equity and the related notes. The financial reporting
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the Parent Company financial
statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006.

As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, in addition to complying
with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the
Group has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards
Board (IASB).

In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the
IASB.

As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement
regarding the appropriateness of the going concern basis of accounting contained
within page 11 to the financial statements and the Directors’ statement on the
longer-term viability of the Group contained within the corporate governance
statement on page 33.

We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:

 - the Directors’ confirmation on page 20 that they have carried out a robust
assessment of the principal risks facing the Group, including those that would
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;

- the disclosures on pages 20-23 that describe those risks and explain how they are
being managed or mitigated;

- the Directors’ statement on page 11 about whether they considered it appropriate
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their
identification of any material uncertainties to the Group’s ability to continue to do
so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the
financial statements; and

- the Directors’ explanation on page 33 as to how they have assessed the prospects
of the Group, over what period they have done so and why they consider that

period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its
liabilities as they fall due over the period of their assessment, including any
related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or
assumptions.

We agreed with the Directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and
we did not identify any such material uncertainties. However, because not all future
events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

**Independence** We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards
for Auditors and we confirm that we are independent of the Group and we have
fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards. We
also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred
to in those standards.

**Our assessment of risks** The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the
**of material misstatement** greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and
directing the efforts of the engagement team.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk


**Revenue recognition**
Revenue represents a material balance of
£1,835m consisting of a high volume of
individually low value transactions and we
have identified the following types of
transactions and assertions related to
revenue recognition which give rise to key
risks:

- the completeness of revenue recorded as
a result of the reliance on output of the
billing systems;

- the accuracy and completeness of revenue
recognised on transactions which are
outside the normal billing process, which
by their nature carry a higher level of
management judgement; and

 - the appropriateness of the allocation of
the total transaction value between
multiple elements in a bundled
transaction.

See note 1 to the financial statements for
revenue recognition policy.

**Supplier income**
As disclosed in note 1 to the financial
statements, the Group periodically receives
commercial income, bonuses or other
rebates from suppliers. As per note 3 the
amount received in the current year was
£13m. There is a risk that these are
incorrectly accounted for or recognised in
the wrong accounting period.


We involved our IT specialists to test the operating effectiveness
of automated and non-automated controls over the customer
billing systems. Our tests assessed the controls in place to ensure
all services supplied to customers are input into and processed
through the billing systems.

This enabled us to take a controls reliance approach over billing
systems accounting for over 95% of total Group revenue. We
subsequently applied a combination of substantive analytical
review procedures and tests of detail to obtain assurance over the
validity and completeness of the reported output of these systems.

We performed substantive testing on a sample of non-systematic
adjustments which are outside of the normal billing process and
therefore carry higher levels of management judgement. These
included revenue deferrals and the write-back to the income
statement of credits applied to customer accounts. This included
agreeing a sample of items to supporting evidence to determine
whether in line with Group policies as well as analytical review to
understand the movement’s year on year.

We have assessed the appropriateness of the revenue recognition
policy and also performed substantive testing to assess whether
the fair value of elements delivered up front exceeds amounts
billable and therefore the unbundling accounting policy has been
appropriately applied.

We held discussions with the relationship managers for the major
suppliers across the Group and reviewed supplier accounts to
identify significant credits from suppliers. For significant credit
items we reviewed the relevant agreements to understand the
terms and conditions associated with the transaction and
associated commercial rationale. Based on our review of the
agreements, we have challenged management’s recognition of the
accounting treatment of credits recognised from suppliers
including re-calculations of amounts recognised.

The incident also resulted in increased
customer churn, which has impacted Group
results for the second half of the year and
future cash flows. Key assumptions
underpinning future cash flows have been
reassessed in light of this to define the
impact on headroom against committed
facilities.


**Carrying value of goodwill**
As disclosed in note 11 to the financial
statements the carrying value of goodwill on
the Group balance sheet as at 31 March
2016 is £495m. Management is required to
undertake an impairment review annually
or, if more frequent, whenever there is an
indication that the asset may be impaired.
This review incorporates judgements based
on assumptions of future cash flows,


We challenged management’s assumptions used in the
impairment model for goodwill and intangible assets, including
the determination of cash generating units, the forecast cash flow
projections for each cash generating unit and the discount rates
applied. In making this assessment of the cash flow projections
we assessed historical forecasting accuracy and compared
forecast profit margins to historical margins and benchmarked the
discount rate and growth rates employed to available market data.
We critically assessed management’s position as to whether or
not a reasonably possible change to key operating assumptions

could result in an impairment. In doing so we considered the
sensitivity of the asset valuations to these assumptions, in
particular changes to the long term growth rate assumed. We
assessed whether the forecasts being used for these purposes had
been updated for the impacts of the cyber attack. We used our
specialist team to determine whether the discount rate used in the
calculations was appropriate. We also considered the
appropriateness of the related disclosures set out in note 11 to the
financial statements.

We have used our in-house tax specialists to challenge
management’s approach to the deferred tax recognised in the year
including the decision to continue to use a ten year forecast for
the recognition of deferred tax assets in respect of losses. We
have considered if the forecasts being used for these purposes
have been updated to align to the Group forecast which has been
updated to include the impact of the cyber attack in the year.

treatment applied by management.
As above, the recent cyber attack on the
Company’s website has had an impact on
future cash flows and profitability which has
also required consideration when assessing
the recoverability of deferred tax assets
against future profits.


Last year our report included acquisition accounting as a risk which is not included in our report this year. There
were material acquisitions in the prior year giving rise to cumulative goodwill of £11m and other intangibles
assets of £43m. The Group has not made any material acquisitions in the current year and therefore this risk is no
longer relevant for our audit report.

The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit
Committee discussed on page 35.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

**Our application of materiality** We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

We determined materiality for the Group to be £4.8m, which is
approximately 5% of adjusted pre-tax profit. Pre-tax profit has
been adjusted by removing the effect of exceptional items. This
has been used as a base as it is a key performance indicator of the
Group and is of particular interest to shareholders. This is a
change of approach from 2015, where we used a materiality of
£6m which was around 7.3% of adjusted pre-tax profit. The prior
year materiality was set by blending revenue and profit metrics.
This approach was taken to make allowance for the impact of
subscriber acquisition costs related to TV customers which
reduced prior year earnings.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report all
audit differences in excess of £96,000 (2015: £120,000), as well
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted
reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit
Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when
assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.

**An overview of the scope of our audit** Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the
Group and its environment, including Group-wide controls, and
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope
primarily on the TalkTalk Consumer and TalkTalk Business
operating units. Each of these were subject to a full audit and
represent over 95% (2015: over 95%) of the Group’s total assets
and revenues. Specific focused audit work was performed over
Group functions, including those covering treasury and taxation.
Our audit work at each division was executed at levels of
materiality which were lower than Group materiality.

At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process
and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the
aggregated financial information of the remaining components
not subject to audit.

**Opinion on other matters prescribed by** In our opinion:
**the Companies Act 2006**

                        - the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006; and

                        - the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

**_Adequacy of explanations received and_** Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you
**_accounting records_** if, in our opinion:

                        - we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit; or

                       - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

                       - the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement
with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

**_Directors’ remuneration_** Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in
our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have
not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.

F-29


-----

**_Corporate Governance Statement_** Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate
Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our
review.

**_Our duty to read other information in the_** Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we
**_Annual Report_** are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the
Annual Report is:

                        - materially inconsistent with the information in the audited
financial statements; or

                        - apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the
course of performing our audit; or

                       - otherwise misleading.

In particular, we are required to consider whether we have
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider
the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and
whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters
that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not
identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.

**Respective responsibilities of directors** As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities
**and auditor** Statement on page 38, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and
Ireland). We also comply with International Standard on Quality
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim
to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective,
understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include
our dedicated professional standards review team and
independent partner reviews.

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Scope of the audit of the financial** An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
**statements** disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately

disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates

financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and
non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we
consider the implications for our report.

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements

 1. Accounting policies and basis of preparation

**_Basis of preparation_**

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC is incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act
2006. The Company’s shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The registered office of the Company is
11 Evesham Street, London W11 4AR.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union (EU) and as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. These financial statements therefore comply with
Article 4 of the European Union International Accounting Standard regulation.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain
financial instruments and investments. The financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest
million, because that is the currency of the principal economic environment in which the Group operates.

**_Basis of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by
the Company (its subsidiaries) and entities which are joint ventures accounted for using the equity method made
up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included from or to the date on which control
passed to or was relinquished by the Group. Intercompany transactions and balances between subsidiaries are
eliminated on consolidation.

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries and the results of joint
ventures to bring accounting policies in line with those used by the Group.

**_Going concern_**

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Details of the considerations undertaken
by the Directors in reaching this conclusion are set out on page 11 within the Chief Financial Officer’s
Statement.

**_Viability statement_**

Details of the considerations undertaken by the Directors in reaching their conclusions are set out on page 33
within the Corporate Governance section.

**_Accounting policies_**

The Group’s principal accounting policies, which relate to the financial statements as a whole, are set out below.
Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates. This
section also shows new EU-endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, whether these are
effective in the current or later years. In both cases it is explained how they are expected to impact the
performance of the Group.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is stated net of VAT and other sales-related taxes and represents the gross inflow of economic benefit
generated from the provision of fixed line, TV and mobile telecommunications services. All such revenue is
recognised as the services are provided:

 - line rental is recognised in the period to which it relates;

- voice and broadband subscriptions are recognised in the period to which they relate;

F-37


-----

- usage including voice and TV content is recognised in the period in which the customer takes the service;

- promotional discounts and credits are amortised on a straight line basis over the minimum contract period
subject to an adjustment for in-contract churn; and

 - data service solutions and other service contracts are recognised as the Group fulfils its performance
obligations.

Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. When the Group sells a number of
products within a bundled transaction, the total consideration from the arrangement is allocated to each element
based on their relative fair values. Management applies judgement in determining the amount of revenue the
Group recognises for delivered elements. This is limited to the amounts billed for that element.

**_Subscriber acquisition costs_**

Subscriber acquisition costs include both third party costs of recruiting and retaining new customers as well as
device costs. Certain subscriber acquisition costs relate to revenue share arrangements with third parties. These
are expensed as incurred.

**_Foreign currency translation and transactions_**

Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases or sales of the relevant currencies
and are recognised in the financial statements at the exchange rates obtained. Unhedged transactions are recorded
at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ has been applied in the current and preceding financial year by
marking to market the relevant financial instruments at the balance sheet date and recognising the gain or loss
through other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow hedges.

The principal exchange rates against UK Sterling used in these financial statements are as follows:

**Average** **Closing**
**2016** **2015** **2016** **2015**

Euro **1.36** 1.29 **1.26** 1.38
United States Dollar **1.50** 1.61 **1.44** 1.49

**_Leases_**

Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the
period of the lease, even where payments are not made on such a basis. Lease incentives and rent free periods are
amortised through the income statement over the period of the lease term.

Gains or losses from sale and leaseback transactions are deferred over the life of the new lease to the extent that
the rentals are considered to be above or below market rentals. The remaining gain or loss is recognised within
operating expenses in the year in which the sale is completed.

**_Financial instruments_**

Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised in the Group balance
sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

_Trade and other receivables_

Trade receivables and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective
interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.

_Rebates receivable from suppliers_

Occasionally, the Group enters into agreements with certain suppliers for rebates on the cost of goods purchased.
Judgement is applied by management in these circumstances to ensure that the rebate is recognised over the
appropriate financial period.

F-38


-----

Rebates from suppliers in the year related to renegotiated contract rates and compensation received under
existing contracts. Where these amounts relate to historical transactions, negotiated in the current year, they are
recognised in the current year income statement. Where they relate to future transactions, negotiated in the
current year, they are recognised in accordance with the contractual terms.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at bank and in hand and bank deposits.

_Trade payables_

Trade payables are other financial liabilities initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost.

_Financial liabilities and equity instruments_

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the
contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of
its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies adopted
for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.

_Borrowings_

Borrowings represent committed and uncommitted bank loans, US Private Placement Notes and bank overdrafts.
These are initially measured at net proceeds and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective
interest rate method.

Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of external financing are capitalised and amortised over
the term of the relevant facility. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in
which they are incurred.

Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

_Equity instruments_

Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issuance costs.

Shares in the Company held by the Group ESOT are shown as a reduction in shareholders’ funds. Other assets
and liabilities held by the trust are consolidated with the assets of the Group.

_Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting_

The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The
use of financial derivatives is governed by the framework approved by the Board, which provides written
principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. Changes in
values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs in the
income statement. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently
remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no
longer qualifies for hedge accounting, or the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.

_Cash flow hedges_

The Group uses derivative instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to manage its interest rate risk. The Group
designates these as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these instruments is
recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the income statement.

F-39


-----

_Measurement_

The financial instruments included on the Group balance sheet are measured at fair value or amortised cost. The
measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective and can depend on the inputs used in the
calculations. The different valuation methods are called ‘hierarchies’ and are described below:

 - Level 1: Fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities;

- Level 2: Fair values measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly; and

 - Level 3: Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market
data.

**_Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s
accounting policies. Estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are continually
reviewed and revised as necessary. Whilst every effort is made to ensure that such estimates and assumptions are
reasonable, by their nature they are uncertain, and as such changes in estimates and assumptions may have a
material impact.

The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements
are set out in more detail in the related notes:

- going concern and viability statement (pages 11 and 33 respectively);

 - rebates receivable from suppliers (note 1);

- revenue recognition for bundled transactions (note 1);

 - taxation (note 7);

- exceptional items (note 9);

- impairment of goodwill (note 11);

 - valuation of intangibles (note 11); and

- impairment of assets (notes 11 and 12).

**_Application of significant new or amended EU-endorsed accounting standards_**

There are no new or revised standards and interpretations that have had a material impact on the Group during
the year.

**_Future accounting developments_**

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, there were a number of significant standards and
interpretations that have not been applied in these financial statements, these were in issue, but not yet effective
(and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU).

The Directors expect that the following standards will have material impact on the financial statements of the
Group in future periods:

- IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, impacting both the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments.
The effective date of these changes for the Group is 1 April 2018.

- IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, impacting revenue recognition, related costs and
disclosures. The effective date of these changes for the Group is 1 April 2017. An evaluation
project has commenced to review and implement this accounting development.

- IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, impacting lease recognition. The effective date of these changes for the Group is 1 April
2019.

Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these
standards until a detailed review has been concluded.

### 2. Segmental reporting

**_Accounting policy_**

IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires the segmental information presented in the financial statements to be that
used by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) to evaluate the performance of the business and decide how
to allocate resources. The Group has identified the Board as its CODM. The Board considers the results of the
business as a whole when assessing the performance of the business and making decisions about the allocation of
resources. Accordingly the Group has one operating segment with all trading operations based in the United
Kingdom.

**2016** **2015**

### 4. Employee costs

The average number of employees (including Executive Directors) was:

**2016** **2015**
**Number** **Number**

Administration **1,670** 1,452
Sales and customer management **620** 655

**2,290** 2,107

The aggregate remuneration recognised in respect of these employees in the income statement comprised:

**2016** **2015**
**£m** **£m**

Wages and salaries **115** 102
Social security costs **15** 12
Other pension costs **4** 4

**134** 118
Share-based payments (note 5) **5** 4

**139** 122

The Group provides various defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of a significant number of its
employees. These are charged to the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of
the schemes.

Compensation earned by key management personnel is analysed below. The key management personnel
comprised the Board of Directors (see Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 55) and the Executive
Committee.

**2016** **2015**
**£m** **£m**

Salaries and fees **3.8** 3.2

Benefits **0.1** 0.2
Pension costs **0.2** 0.2
Share-based payments **1.4** 1.8
Compensation for loss of office **—** 0.2

**7.3** 7.5

### 5. Share-based payments

**_Accounting policy_**

The Group issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees and Executive Directors. Equity
settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period,
based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.

Fair value is measured by use of a dividend discount or binomial model for share-based payments with internal,
non-market performance criteria (for example, EPS targets) and a Black Scholes or Monte Carlo model for those
with external performance criteria (for example, TSR targets).

For schemes with non-market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is recalculated at each
balance sheet date, based on expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting. The
movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement,
with a corresponding entry in reserves.

For schemes with market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is adjusted only for
expectations of leavers prior to vesting. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet
date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.

F-42


-----

If a scheme is cancelled, any remaining part of the fair value of the scheme is expensed immediately. If a scheme
is forfeited, no further expense is recognised and any charges previously recognised are reversed.

Charges arise on loans that are provided to employees to fund the purchase of shares in the Group as part of long
term incentive plans. To the extent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable, the cost of
such loans is expensed over the course of the relevant incentive plans. Charges are also recognised on loans
provided to employees to settle personal tax liabilities. To the extent to which the loans are not, in certain
circumstances, repayable, the cost of such loans is expensed.

**_TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC schemes_**

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC schemes are the Shareholder Value Plan (SVP), Discretionary Share Option Plan
(DSOP), Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) Scheme and Share Match Plan (SIP). Where applicable, the ESOT holds
shares to settle these plans, based on the latest view of vesting.

In order to aid the user of the financial statements, the dilutive effect on EPS of each scheme has been presented.
This has been calculated using an average share price for the financial year of £2.92 (2015: £3.00).

_(i) SVP_

The SVP is a growth plan and not a share option plan operating under the Value Enhancement Scheme (VES)
rules previously approved by shareholders. The SVP enables participants to share in up to 7% of any increase in
the value of the Group over an opening market capitalisation of £2,941m based on a five business day average up
to 3 June 2014. The awards are subject to the following performance conditions:

- at least a 7% compound annual increase (CAGR) in the market capitalisation of the Group from the above
valuation over a three and four year period; and

- the Group’s TSR outperforms the FTSE 250.

F-43


-----

The performance conditions are measured over an initial performance period from 3 June 2014 to the date of
announcement of the Group’s FY17 annual results, after which a total of 60% of the options will vest. The
remaining options are measured over a performance period from 3 June 2014 to the date of announcement of the
Group’s FY18 annual results. The Pool also has a maximum cap on incremental value equal to 2.75% of the total
issued share capital of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC at the date of each vesting.

There is a holding period on 100% of the PLC shares received in exchange for participation shares on vesting, of
twelve months from each vesting date for Executive Directors. All other participants are required to hold 50% of
the PLC shares received in exchange for participation shares on vesting for twelve months from each vesting
date.

In FY15, the Company made awards in the SVP. No awards were made in the year ended 31 March 2016. The
Group advanced loans to participants to enable them to purchase participation shares in TalkTalk Group Limited,
the holding company of the Group’s operating business. These loans are subject to a commercial rate of interest
set by HMRC.

If an employee leaves the Group before the scheme vests, then the participation shares are forfeited for the value
of the outstanding loan plus accrued interest.

A fair value exercise was conducted for the award using the Monte Carlo method with the total fair value of the
participation shares granted totalling £6m.

A summary of the scheme is shown below:

_(ii) DSOP_

In FY15 (‘2014 grant’) and FY16 (‘2015 grant’), the Group granted eight million nil-priced share option awards
and two million nil-priced share option awards respectively. These awards are subject to the following
performance conditions:

- at least a 7% compound annual increase (CAGR) in the market capitalisation of the Group from the below
valuation over the next three and four year periods; and

- the Group’s TSR outperforms the FTSE 250.

The options are measured as follows:

- 2014 grant: a performance period from 3 June 2014 to 3 June 2017 vesting on announcement of the Group’s
FY17 annual results. A total of 60% of the vested options are exercisable from the vesting date, with the
remaining 40% of options being exercisable twelve months later. Options are forfeited if an employee leaves
the Group before the options vest, subject to the DSOP scheme rules.

- 2015 grant: a performance period from 11 September 2015 to 11 September 2018 vesting on 11 September
2018. The vested options are only exercisable twelve months following the vesting date. Options are forfeited
if an employee leaves the Group before the options vest, subject to the DSOP scheme rules.

In FY14 (‘2013 grant’), the Group granted six million nil-priced share option awards subject to absolute TSR and
EPS performance targets. The options are measured over a performance period to 31 March 2016 and will vest
on the announcement of the Group’s FY16 annual results. A total of 60% of the vested options are exercisable
from the vesting date, with the remaining 40% of options being exercisable twelve months later. Options are

F-44


-----

forfeited if an employee leaves the Group before the options vest subject to the DSOP scheme rules. Awards are
triggered within a range from 5% to 26% for compound annual growth of TSR and EPS. If the minimum
performance requirement is met a total of 25% of the award will vest, with incremental thresholds at 40%, 70%
and 100%.

The second and final tranche (40%) of the 2012 DSOP grant (in FY13) is exercisable on 12 May 2016. Options
are forfeited if an employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

_(iv) Share Match Plan_

The Group launched its first all-employee, HMRC-approved Share Match Plan (SIP) in June 2014, following the
Remuneration Committee approval of this scheme in the year ended 31 March 2014. This enables eligible
employees to purchase market-priced shares by entering into a partnership share agreement and holding such
shares in trust for up to a five year period. The rules of the Plan allow an employee maximum contribution of
£1,800 per annum, or in line with HMRC limits if these are increased. Approval for the TTG Share Match was
granted by shareholders at the AGM on 24 July 2013.

The Remuneration Committee, at its discretion, may award matching and/or free shares to eligible participants.
Matching shares may be granted up to a maximum ratio of two matching shares for each partnership share
purchased by a participant. Free shares may be awarded up to a maximum value of £3,600 tax free per annum, or
in line with HMRC limits if these are increased.

Currently the Group provides one matching share for each partnership share purchased by participating
employees or Executive Directors. During the year ended 31 March 2016, the impact of the SIP on the Group’s
results was not material.

### 6. Net finance costs

Net finance costs are analysed as follows:

**2016** 2015
**£m** £m

Interest on bank loans and overdrafts **21** 17
Facility fees and similar charges **3** 5

**24** 22

During the year ended 31 March 2016 and 2015 the impact of finance income was not material.

In FY16, the Group signed two new revolving credit facilities. Arrangement fees of £1m were paid and are
amortised over the life of the facilities. In FY15, the Group refinanced its term loan and revolving credit facility
with bank debt and US Private Placement Notes and paid £5m in respect of arrangement and legal fees. The fees
are being amortised over the expected life of the loan and notes and are included within facility fees and similar
charges above. The average interest rate in the year was 3.10% (2015: 3.00%).

### 7. Taxation

**_Accounting policy_**

Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or
recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the
balance sheet and its tax base.

Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, and
the carry-forward of unused tax losses and credits. Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised. Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except
where it relates to an item recognised directly in reserves, in which case it is recognised directly in reserves.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.

**_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_**

The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to which taxable profits are generated in the
relevant jurisdictions for the foreseeable future, and on the tax legislation then in force, and as such the value of
associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.

**_Tax—income statement_**

The tax charge on Headline earnings for the year ended 31 March 2016 was £28m (2015: £19m), representing an
effective tax rate on pre-tax profits of 26% (2015: 20%). The tax charge on statutory earnings for the year ended
31 March 2016 was £12m (2015: credit of £40m). The reconciliation between the Headline and statutory tax
charge is shown in note 9.

**At 31 March 2015** 6 54 69 — 1 130

No deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in either year, except where there is a legal right to do so in
the relevant jurisdictions.

On 26 October 2015, a reduction in the UK statutory rate of taxation was substantively enacted, bringing the tax
rate down from 20% to 19% with effect from 1 April 2017 and from 19% to 18% from 1 April 2020.

F-48


-----

Accordingly, the tax assets and liabilities recognised at 31 March 2016 take account of these changes. This has
resulted in a tax charge of £9m to the income statement as the value of the Group’s tax assets has been reduced,
of which £3m relates to the prior year exceptional items (note 9).

During the prior year, the Company reviewed the period over which it recognises assets in respect of brought
forward tax losses and revised this from five years to ten years due to the increased stability of the TV
proposition. The incremental movement of £29m was recognised through exceptional items.

At 31 March 2016, the Group had unused tax losses of £650m (2015: £674m) available for offset against future
taxable profits. A deferred tax asset of £56m (2015: £69m) has been recognised in respect of £299m (2015:
£347m) of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £351m (2015: £327m) as there is
insufficient evidence that there will be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered. All
losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

### 8. Dividends

**_Accounting policy_**

Dividend income is recognised when payment has been received. Final dividend distributions are recognised as a
liability in the financial statements in the year in which they are approved by the relevant shareholders. Interim
dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid.

The following dividends were paid by the Group to its shareholders:

**2016** **2015**
**£m** **£m**

**Ordinary dividends**
Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2014 of 8.00p per ordinary share **—** 74
Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2015 of 4.60p per ordinary share **—** 42
Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2015 of 9.20p per ordinary share **85** —
Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2016 of 5.29p per ordinary share **50** —

**Total ordinary dividends[(1)]** **135** 116

(1) Deducted from Company reserves. See Company statement of changes in equity on page 105.

The proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2016 of 10.58p (2015: 9.20p) per ordinary share on
approximately 946 million (2015: 922 million) ordinary shares (approximately £100m) was approved by the
Board on 12 May 2016 and will be recommended to shareholders at the AGM on 20 July 2016. The dividend has
not been included as a liability as at 31 March 2016.

The Group ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends in the current and prior year and this is reflected in
the analysis above.

### 9. Reconciliation of Headline information to statutory information

Headline information is provided because the Directors consider that it provides assistance in understanding the
Group’s underlying performance.

**_Accounting policy_**

Headline results are stated before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items. Exceptional
items are those that are considered to be one-off or non-recurring in nature and so material that the Directors
believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid distortion of the presentation of underlying performance and
should be separately presented on the face of the income statement.

F-49


-----

**_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_**

The classification of items as exceptional is subjective in nature and therefore judgement is required to determine
whether the item is in line with the accounting policy criteria outlined above. Determining whether an item is
exceptional is a matter of qualitative assessment, making it distinct from the Group’s other critical accounting
judgements where the basis for judgement is estimation.

_a) Revenue_

**Cyber attack**

On 21 October 2015, there was a significant and sustained cyber attack on the TalkTalk website. Following this
attack the Group has issued an increased number of credits to retain its customers. The costs of these credits are
recognised against revenue and amount to £3m (2015: n/a).

A total taxation credit of £1m has been recognised on these costs in the year ended 31 March 2016 (2015: n/a).

**Other**

In the prior year statutory results were two items relating to ongoing commercial discussions; the treatment of
prompt payment discounts and historical termination charge settlements with other Mobile Network Operators.
The net impact of these two items was not material.

_b) Cyber attack_

The Group has incurred costs in the year ended 31 March 2016 of £39m (2015: n/a). These costs include
restoring our online capability with enhanced security features, associated IT, incident response and consultancy
costs and providing free upgrades to our customers.

A total taxation credit of £8m (2015: n/a) has been recognised in relation to these items in the year ended
31 March 2016.

_c) Operating efficiencies—Making TalkTalk Simpler (MTTS)_

During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group continued its wide ranging transformation programme that is
delivering material improvements to our customers’ experience, driving operating cost savings, and reducing
SAC through lower churn and costs per add (CPA).

The costs incurred in the year include work on improving Consumer and TalkTalk Business systems and
processes which focus on customer experience; the review of the organisational structure of the business and the
sites where the Group operates.

These programmes have resulted in £41m (2015: £29m) of costs including project management, redundancy,
property, consultancy, migration and call centre costs.

A total taxation credit of £8m has been recognised on these costs in the year ended 31 March 2016 (2015: £7m).

_d) Acquisitions and disposal_

In the prior year, the Group acquired broadband and voice customer bases from both Virgin Media Limited
(‘Virgin Media’) and Tesco Stores Limited (‘Tesco’). The Group has recognised an exceptional credit of £2m in
the year ended 31 March 2016 in relation to the acquisition of Virgin Media, following the reassessment of the
value of contingent consideration recognised for this acquisition.

During the year ended 31 March 2015, exceptional charges of £4m were recognised in relation to the migration
of Virgin Media and Tesco customers onto the Group’s network and integration costs including redundancy.
Further to this, the Group also provided for £10m of costs in respect of committed future programmes
predominantly in respect of migration, reorganisation and related costs.

A total taxation charge of £nil (2015: £2m) has been recognised in relation to these items in the year ended
31 March 2016.

Also in the prior year, the Group disposed of its Off-net broadband customer base to Fleur Telecom Limited.
Following a delay in the migration of these customers, the Group has recognised an exceptional charge of £2m
(2015: exceptional credit of £5m).

_e) Taxation items_

The Group has recognised a tax charge of £3m which relates to the impact of the statutory corporation tax rate
change from 20% to 19% and then to 18% on prior year exceptional tax assets. In the prior year, the time period
over which VNL losses were recognised was increased from five to ten years which resulted in the recognition of
an additional tranche of losses. This movement was treated as an exceptional item and, as such, the reduction in
the tax rate relating to these losses has also been treated as exceptional in 2016.

_f) Amortisation of acquisition intangibles_

An amortisation charge in respect of acquisition intangibles of £10m was incurred in the year ended 31 March
2016 (2015: £6m).

A total taxation credit of £2m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2016 (2015: £1m).

### 11. Goodwill and other intangible assets

**_(a) Goodwill_**

_Accounting policy_

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing the excess of the fair
value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recognised
initially as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss
on disposal.

_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_

The Group has two cash generating units (CGU)—TalkTalk Consumer and TalkTalk Business. For the purpose
of impairment testing, at the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from
the synergies of the acquisition. The Group’s shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central
overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows that those shared costs
support.

Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the
CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates to use to calculate present values.

_Impairment of goodwill_

Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication
that the asset may be impaired; this review is performed at a CGU level.

Impairment is determined by assessing the future cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill relates. The
future cash flows of the Group are taken from the Board approved five year plan and extrapolated out to 20 years
based on the UK’s long term growth rate. This is discounted by the CGU’s weighted average cost of capital pretax to give the net present value of that CGU. Where the net present value of future cash flows is less than the
carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.

Sensitivity analysis is performed using reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions.

The goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the CGUs that are expected to
benefit from that business combination. The allocation of goodwill across the CGUs is as follows:

**2016** **2015**
**£m** **£m**

TalkTalk Consumer **347** 348
TalkTalk Business **148** 142

**495** 490

_Impairment review_

The key assumptions used in the Group’s goodwill impairment review are as follows:

**• Long term growth rates**

Long term revenue growth rates applied are based on the growth rate for the UK per the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The rate applied in the current year was 2.0% (2015: 2.2%).

**• Discount rate**

The underlying discount rate for each CGU is based on the UK ten year gilt rate adjusted for an equity risk
premium and the systematic risk of the CGU. The average pre-tax rate for both CGUs used to discount the
forecast cash flows is 10.2% (2015: 9.0%). The assumptions used in the calculation of the CGUs’ discount rate
are benchmarked to externally available data. The same discount rate has been applied to both CGUs due to the
similarity of risk factors and geographical location.

**• Capital expenditure**

Forecast capital expenditure is based on senior management expectations of future required support of the
network and current run rate of expenditure, typically at 6% of revenue.

**• Customer factors**

The key assumptions for the forecast cash flows of each of the CGUs are based on expected customer growth
rates, ARPU, direct costs including acquisition costs, and changes in product mix. The value assigned to each of
these assumptions has been determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends in the Group, adjusted for
the impact of the cyber attack in the year and external information on expected trends of future market
developments.

Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and the Directors have not identified any
reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed
the recoverable amount.

**_(b) Other intangible assets_**

_Accounting policy_

**Operating intangibles**

Operating intangibles include internal infrastructure and design costs incurred in the development of software for
internal use. Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately
identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, and the development cost can be
measured reliably. Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in
the year in which it is incurred. Directly attributable costs that are capitalised include employee costs specifically
incurred in the development of the intangible asset. Operating intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis
over their estimated useful economic lives of up to eight years.

**Acquisition intangibles**

Acquired intangible assets such as customer bases and other intangible assets acquired through a business
combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and amortised over their expected useful lives of up to six

F-53


-----

years on a straight line basis. The value attributed to such assets is based on the future economic benefit that is
expected to be derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash flows after a deduction for
contributory assets.

_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_

**Impairment**

At the acquisition date, acquisition intangibles are allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the
synergies of the combination. The Group’s shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central
overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows.

Determining whether the carrying amounts of operating and acquisition intangibles have any indication of
impairment requires judgement. If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to
assess whether the carrying amounts can be supported by the value in use of the CGU that the asset is allocated
to.

The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of
appropriate discount rates to use to calculate present values.

**Useful economic lives**

The assessment of the useful economic lives of these operating and acquisition intangibles requires judgement.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement based on the useful economic life selected. This assessment
requires estimation of the period over which the Group will benefit from the assets.

_Impairment of assets_

The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that
those assets have suffered an impairment loss at each reporting date. Where an indicator of impairment exists, the
Group makes a formal estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount and the extent of any impairment loss.

The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the
asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.

**Closing balance at 31 March 2015** 136 42 178

_Operating intangibles_

Operating intangibles includes internally generated assets with a net book value of £88m (2015: £59m), which
are amortised over a period of up to eight years. This includes additions of £43m (2015: £31m) and an
amortisation charge of £14m (2015: £10m) in the year ended 31 March 2016.

Included within operating intangibles is the following asset, which is material to the Group:

- TRIO, the customer billing system, which has a net book value of £47m (2015: £66m). TRIO is amortised
over a period of up to eight years depending on the release date of the relevant component. The weighted
average remaining useful economic life of the components of TRIO is two years (2015: three years).

_Acquisition intangibles_

Acquisition intangibles relate largely to the broadband customer bases acquired from Virgin Media and Tesco in
the prior year; these customer bases are valued from the discounted future cash flows expected from them, after a
deduction for contributory assets. The remainder of acquisition intangibles relates to the website acquired as part
of the blinkbox transaction also in the prior year.

At 31 March 2016, the net book value of the acquired broadband bases are material to the Group; with the Virgin
Media base valued at £16m (2015: £22m) and the Tesco base valued at £15m (2015: £16m), with remaining
useful economic lives of 46 months (2015: 58 months) and 47 months (2015: 59 months) respectively.

### 12. Property, plant and equipment

**_Accounting policy_**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less
estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life from the date it is
brought into use, as follows:

Short leasehold improvements 10% or the lease term if less than ten years
Land and buildings 3.33% per annum
Network equipment and computer hardware 12.5–50% per annum
Fixtures and fittings 20–25% per annum

**_Impairment of assets_**

_Property, plant and equipment_

The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its fixed assets to determine whether there is any indication that
those assets have suffered an impairment loss at each reporting date. The Group uses the same methodology as
set out in note 11 for operating and acquisition intangibles.

### 13. Non-current asset investments

**_Accounting policy_**

Investments, other than subsidiaries, are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration
given plus any transaction costs associated with the acquisition.

Investments are categorised as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value, together
with any related taxation, are taken directly to equity and recycled to the income statement when the investment
is sold or determined to be impaired.

Non-current asset investments at 31 March 2016 related to a 7.3% (2015: 7.3%) interest in Shared Band Limited,
a telecommunications technology provider. The cost of the investment is not material.

**5** 11

The Group has made the following acquisition during the year ended 31 March 2016:

**_tIPicall Limited_**

On 22 April 2015, the Group acquired 100% shares of tIPicall Limited, a company providing Voice over Internet
Protocol (VoIP) services. The acquisition was satisfied by £5m cash plus £1m of contingent consideration
depending on the performance of the business.

The amounts recognised in respect of assets and liabilities acquired are immaterial to the Group. The book value
of the assets acquired is expected to equal their fair value. On this basis provisional goodwill recognised in
relation to the acquisition is £6m. This represents the future opportunities arising from the nature of the business
and fit with the Group’s existing operations. The provisional goodwill has been allocated to the Business cash
generating unit (CGU).

The total impact on the Group for the year ended 31 March 2016 in relation to revenue and profit before taxation
amounted to £2m and £nil respectively.

The Group made the following acquisitions during the year ended 31 March 2015:

**_Virgin Media broadband customer base acquisition_**

On 27 October 2014, the Group acquired the Virgin Media broadband service business from Virgin Media,
which comprises broadband customers (MPF, SMPF and IP Stream). The acquisition is complementary to the
Group’s existing business model. The legal title of asset was transferred as the customers migrated to the Group’s
network, which substantially took place in the period from December 2014 to March 2015. As this is an
acquisition of customer base, nil voting shares were acquired. Provisional goodwill of £3m was recognised, the
goodwill represents the future economic benefit arising from the aligning of customers’ existing products with
the Group’s products and its fit with existing operations. Goodwill has been allocated to the Consumer CGU.

In 2016, the fair value of the contingent consideration payable in relation to the Virgin Media customer base
acquisition in the prior year was reassessed. A reduction in contingent consideration payable of £2m was required
due to post-acquisition events and circumstances and therefore recognised as exceptional income (note 9).

**_Tesco broadband and voice customer base acquisition_**

On 7 January 2015, the Group acquired the Tesco broadband service business from Tesco which comprises
broadband (MPF, SMPF and IP Stream) and voice customers. The acquisition is complementary to the Group’s

F-58


-----

existing business model. The legal title of asset was transferred on 1 March 2015. As this is an acquisition of
customer base, nil voting shares were acquired. Provisional goodwill of £3m was recognised, the goodwill
represents the future economic benefit arising from aligning the customers’ existing products with the Group’s
products and its fit with existing operations. Goodwill has been allocated to the Consumer CGU.

In 2016, the fair value of the contingent consideration payable in relation to the Tesco customer base acquisition
in the prior year was reassessed. A reduction in contingent consideration payable of £3m was required due to preacquisition events and circumstances. An increase in the acquisition intangible of £2m and an increase in the
provision for unfavourable contracts of £4m was also required due to pre-acquisition events and circumstances.
All these movements were taken to goodwill in line with IFRS 3.

**_TalkTalk TV Entertainment Limited (formerly blinkbox) acquisition_**

On 7 January 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued and voting share capital of TalkTalk TV
Entertainment Limited (formerly blinkbox) from Tesco Holdings Limited. The acquisition is complementary to
the Group’s existing business model. TalkTalk TV Entertainment Limited (formerly blinkbox) provides movies
and TV series online for customers to stream or download on demand.

**Summary of final financial impacts of prior year acquisitions**

The net assets recognised in the prior year were based on a provisional assessment of their fair values. During
2016, the fair values have been reassessed and no adjustments have been identified for the acquisition of Virgin
Media and TalkTalk TV Entertainment Limited (formerly blinkbox). The reassessment of the provisional fair
values in relation to the acquisition of Tesco is summarised below:


**Reassessed**
**fair values**
**£m**

Customer base 17 19 2
Provision for unfavourable contract (2) (6) (4)
**Goodwill** **3** **2** **(1)**

**(ii) Disposals**

In the prior year, the Group agreed to dispose of its existing Off-net broadband customer base to Fleur Telecom
Limited (Fleur), a member of Daisy Communications Group, for a contingent consideration of £8m, generating a
profit on disposal of £5m. The expected cost to sell of £3m was included within the Group’s trade and other
payables. The consideration is contingent on the performance of this customer base in the period of 24 months
following the network migration completion date.

In the current year, due to a delay in the migration of customers to Fleur, the contingent consideration receivable
and expected costs to sell were reassessed. This resulted in a net exceptional charge of £2m (note 9). As at
31 March 2016, there is contingent consideration receivable of £1m included within current assets. There are no
further expected costs to sell as at 31 March 2016.

The customer base was derecognised from the balance sheet at the completion date of 31 March 2015.

**(iii) Asset held for sale**

In the prior year, the Group agreed to sell the acquired Off-net broadband base from Virgin Media and Tesco to
Fleur.

During the year, the Group finalised the disposal of the Off-net broadband base that it had acquired from Virgin
Media to Fleur. The asset held for sale was held at fair value giving rise to no profit/(loss) on disposal. In
addition, the asset held for sale for the acquired Off-net broadband base from Virgin Media is not material.

### 14. Interest in joint ventures

**_Accounting policy_**

Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The Group income statement includes the
Group’s share of the post-tax profits or losses of the joint ventures based on their financial statements for the
year.

In the Group balance sheet, the Group’s interest in joint ventures is shown as a non-current asset, representing the
Group’s investment in the share capital of the joint ventures, as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the
Group’s share of the net assets or liabilities less provision for any impairment.

In addition to the carrying amount of the investment, the Group’s interest in joint ventures includes, where
applicable, any long term interests in the venture that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in
the joint venture. An item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is,
in substance, an extension of the Group’s interest in that joint venture.

Any loans advanced to a joint venture that, in substance, do not form part of the Group’s net investment are
shown separately in the balance sheet as a receivable to the Group. Losses recognised using the equity method in
excess of the Group’s investment in ordinary shares are applied to the other components of the Group’s interest
in the joint venture in the reverse order of their seniority (i.e. priority in liquidation).

_YouView TV Limited (‘YouView’)_

The Group holds 14.3% (2015: 14.3%) of the ordinary share capital of YouView, a joint venture with The British
Broadcasting Corporation, ITV Broadcasting Limited, British Telecom PLC (BT), Channel Four Television
Corporation, Arqiva Limited and Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited. The joint venture was set up in order to
develop a free-to-air internet-connected TV service to UK homes. During the prior year, the Group signed a new
agreement with the other existing holders of YouView whereby all seven original partners (together ‘Tier 1’
funders) continue to contribute approximately £1m per annum to fund basic operational and technology costs of
YouView, and the Group together with BT as ‘Tier 2’ funders contribute up to a further £10m per annum for
additional development of the technology to support their TV propositions. The Group’s total contribution to
YouView in the year ended 31 March 2016 was £8m (2015: £8m).

There was no change in the overall control of the joint venture as a result of these changes as all seven partners
share overall control. Under this agreement, the Group’s share of losses comprises one-seventh of any Tier 1 loss
and half of any Tier 2 loss. During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group recognised a £7m share of losses
(2015: £8m).

The Group has reviewed the carrying value of YouView and has concluded that there is no indication of
impairment.

_Bolt Pro Tem Limited_

The Group holds 33.3% of the ordinary share capital of Bolt Pro Tem Limited (BPT), a joint venture with British
Sky Broadcasting Limited (BSkyB) and City Fibre Holdings Limited. The joint venture was set up in the prior
year to deliver fibre to the premise (FTTP) broadband services in the City of York. The Group has committed to
contributing £5m over the three year period to 31 March 2017. During the year ended 31 March 2016, the Group
contributed £1m (2015: £3m) to the joint venture and received £nil share of losses (2015: £nil).

During the year, due to an increased certainty around the time of the repayment of a portion of the Group’s
contribution to BPT, it was concluded that £3m was, in substance, a loan to BPT and not an extension of the
investment in the joint venture. This has therefore been reclassified on the balance sheet as a non-current trade
and other receivable.

The Group has reviewed the carrying value of BPT and has concluded that there is no indication of impairment.

_Internet Matters Limited_

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group, alongside BSkyB, BT and Virgin Media established an equal
membership joint venture, Internet Matters Limited. It is a not-for-profit company set up as an industry-led body
to promote and educate parents about internet safety for children. The Group is committed to contributing £2m
over the remaining two year period to 31 March 2017.

The Directors estimate that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.

The average credit period taken on trade receivables, calculated by reference to the amount owed at the year end
as a proportion of total revenue in the year, was 29 days (2015: 30 days).

The Group’s trade receivables are denominated in the following currencies:

Trade receivables of £80m (2015: £59m) were past due, but not impaired. These balances primarily relate to
TalkTalk Consumer and TalkTalk Business fixed line customers. The Group has made provisions based on
historical rates of recoverability and all unprovided amounts are considered to be recoverable. The ageing
analysis of these trade receivables is as follows:

**2016** **2015**

The Group has commercially agreed longer credit terms with certain suppliers. Excluding these suppliers, the
underlying average credit period taken on trade payables was 40 days (2015: 33 days). Including these suppliers,
the average credit period taken was 56 days (2015: 43 days). Included in trade payables are capital payables
amounting to £55m (2015: £33m).

Rebates receivable from suppliers are accounted for in accordance with the policy set out in note 1.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.

Borrowings after derivatives **689** 599

_Borrowing facilities_

The Group’s committed facilities increased by £125m in the year to £944m (2015: £819m) as a result of signing
two new facilities in the year.

The financial covenants included in all facilities are identical; they restrict the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and
require minimum levels of interest cover.

The Group was in compliance with its covenants throughout the current and prior year.

Details of the borrowing facilities of the Group as at 31 March 2016 are set out below:

**$185m USPP Notes**

In July 2014 the Group issued $185m of USPP Notes maturing in three tranches ($139m in 2021, $25m in 2024
and $21m in 2026). The interest rate payable on the notes is at a margin over US treasury rate for the appropriate
period. The USPP proceeds were swapped to Sterling to give £109m (£82m in 2021, £15m in 2024 and £12m in
2026) and the net debt includes retranslation of the USPP funds at the rates achieved where hedged by crosscurrency interest swaps.

**£560m revolving credit facility (RCF) and £100m bilateral agreements**

The Group has a £560m RCF, which matures in July 2019. The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under
this facility is at a margin over LIBOR and for the appropriate period. The actual margin applicable to any
drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to Headline EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting
period. In addition to the RCF, the Group also has two £50m bilateral agreements, signed in July 2014 and
August 2015 and both mature in July 2019. Of the £50m bilateral agreement that was signed in August 2015,
£25m has subsequently been cancelled. The terms of the bilateral agreements are consistent with the main RCF.

**£100m term loan**

The Group has a committed term loan of £100m (2015: £100m), with a final maturity date of July 2019. This
loan amortises over the term with repayments due of £25m in January 2017, £25m in January 2018 and the
remainder in July 2019. The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under this facility is at a margin over
LIBOR for the relevant currency and for the appropriate period. The actual margin applicable to any drawing
depends on the ratio of net debt to Headline EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.

**£100m revolving credit facility (RCF)**

In January 2016 the Group signed a £100m RCF which matures in May 2017. The interest rate payable in respect
of drawings under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR and for the appropriate period. The actual margin
applicable to any drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent
accounting period.

_Bank overdrafts_

Overdraft facilities are used to assist in short term cash management; these uncommitted facilities bear interest at
a margin over the Bank of England base rate.

(1) Accrued income has been included within the other receivables so as to give completeness over the Group’s future cash inflows.

(2) Derivative financial instrument on the USPP Notes, consists of £20m (2015: £16m) foreign currency hedge and (£2m) (2015: (£5m)) in
relation to interest rate hedge.

(3) Deferred income has been included within the financial liabilities so as to give completeness over the Group’s contractual commitments
on future cash outflows.

**_(a) Financial instruments_**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including market risk (such as currency risk and
interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group Treasury function uses certain financial instruments to
mitigate potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance from these risks. These financial
instruments primarily consist of bank loans and interest rate swaps. Other products, such as currency options, can
also be used depending on the risks to be covered, but have not been used in the current or preceding financial
year. The Group does not trade or speculate in any financial instruments.

The Group has cash flow hedges in place to (a) swap the interest rate risk on the RCF from floating to fixed and
(b) swap the currency and interest rate risk on the USPP debt from USD to GBP and from fixed US Treasury
interest rates to fixed GBP interest rates. These hedges have been fully effective from inception. The fair value
measurement is classified as Level 2 (2015: Level 2), derived from other observable market data; this means that
their fair value is based upon the mark to market valuation at the balance sheet date. Fair value measurement at
Level 2 gives consideration to interest rates, yield curves and foreign exchange rates at commonly quoted
intervals for relevant currencies. The Group has also assessed the credit risk within its financial instruments. The
fair value of these instruments at 31 March 2016 was £17m (2015: £10m). A gain of £2m (2015: loss of £5m) has
been recognised in other comprehensive income in the year ended 31 March 2016. As the hedges were fully
effective there has been no income statement impact.

**_(b) Embedded derivatives_**

No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and accordingly, no such derivatives have been
accounted for separately.

**_(c) Foreign exchange risk_**

The Group uses spot and forward foreign exchange trading to hedge transactional exposures, which arise mainly
through cost of sales and operating expenses, and are primarily denominated in Euro and US Dollar. The Group
also uses cross-currency swaps to hedge its US Dollar denominated borrowings (US Private Placement). At
31 March 2016 the adjustment to translate our net debt to Sterling at swap rates to reflect the impact of hedging
was £20m (2015: £16m).

Borrowings and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates; this sensitivity
can be analysed in comparison to year-end rates. There was no material impact of a 10% movement in the UK
Sterling/Euro exchange rate on either the income statement or other equity. The effect of foreign exchange
derivatives on borrowings at the year end was as follows:

**UK Sterling** **Euro** **USD** **Total**
**£m** **£m** **£m** **£m**

**2016**
Borrowings before derivatives **580** **—** **129** **709**

Borrowings after derivatives **580** **—** **109** **689**

**UK Sterling** **Euro** **USD** **Total**
**£m** **£m** **£m** **£m**

**2015**
Borrowings before derivatives 490 — 125 615
Derivatives — — (16) (16)

Borrowings after derivatives 490 — 109 599

During the year, the Group used derivatives for the management of US Private Placement debt, foreign currency
cash balances and foreign currency trading balances.

**_(d) Interest rate risk_**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at
floating rates of interest and thus expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. These floating rates are linked
to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency. Future cash flows arising
from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods for each loan or rollover. As detailed in
section (a), the Group has cash flow hedges in place to mitigate its interest rate risk on its borrowings.

Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and
such movements have been analysed in the table below by calculating the effect on the income statement and
equity of a one percentage point movement in the interest rate for the currencies in which most Group cash and
borrowings are denominated. Funding to related parties has been offset against gross borrowings in calculating
these sensitivities. This annualised analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the year end positions
prevail throughout the year, and therefore may not be representative of fluctuations in levels of borrowings.

**2016** **2015**
**£m** **£m**

**100 basis points movement in the UK Sterling interest rate**
Income statement movement **4** 3

**_(e) Liquidity risk_**

The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the long and short term cash flow
projections for the business against facilities and other resources available to it. Headroom is assessed based on
historical experience as well as by assessing current business risks, including foreign exchange movements.
Existing bank debt facilities do not expire until May 2017 and July 2019, USPP debt matures in three tranches in
July 2021, 2024 and 2026; it is Group policy to refinance debt maturities significantly ahead of maturity dates.

(1) The 2015 comparatives have been re-presented to include interest cash flows.

**_(f) Credit risk_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored. Debt, investments, foreign exchange and derivative
transactions are all spread amongst a number of banks, all of which have short or long term credit ratings
appropriate to the Group’s exposures. Trade receivables primarily comprise balances due from fixed line
customers, and provision is made for any receivables that are considered to be irrecoverable.

**_(g) Capital risk management_**

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern
while maximising the return to stakeholders. The Group’s objective is to maintain diversified sources of funding,
including committed and uncommitted bank facilities, private and public bonds and working capital solutions.

The capital structure of the Group currently consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18,
cash and cash equivalents, operating leases and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising
issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 21 to 22.

The Group’s Board reviews the capital structure on an annual basis. As part of this review, the Board concluded
that it is more appropriate to align its measures with the external metrics in the banking agreement. The Group
uses the ratio of net debt to Headline EBITDA and has a medium term ratio target below 2.0x. The ratio at
31 March 2016 is 2.6x post the cyber attack. As the business returns to normal, the Board expects the ratio will
return to its target in the medium term.

The net debt to Headline EBITDA ratio at the year end is as follows:

**2016** **2015**
**£m** **£m**

Debt **(709)** (615)
Cash and cash equivalents **10** 10

**_Accounting policy_**

Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of past events and it is
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is considered to be
material.

Provisions are categorised as follows:

_One Company integration_

These provisions relate principally to reorganisation costs and are only recognised where plans are demonstrably
committed and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next twelve months.

_Property_

Property provisions relate to dilapidations and similar property costs, and costs associated with onerous property
contracts. All such provisions are assessed by reference to the terms and conditions of the contract and market
conditions at the balance sheet date. Onerous property contracts are expected to be utilised over the next seven
years. Dilapidation provisions are expected to be utilised as and when properties are exited. These provisions
include the costs of exiting our Warrington and Irlam sites, as the Group relocates to one site at the Soapworks in
Salford in April 2017.

_Contract and other_

Contract and other provisions relate mainly to customer migration costs as a result of the customer base
acquisitions in the current year and the SIM replacement costs as part of the mobile migration programme
provided for in the prior year. The remaining are provisions on onerous contracts and contracts with unfavourable

terms arising on the acquisition of businesses and anticipated costs of unresolved legal disputes. All such
provisions are assessed by reference to the best available information at the balance sheet date.

**_Share premium_**

The share premium account records the difference between the nominal amount of shares issued and the fair
value of the consideration received. The share premium account may be used for certain purposes specified by
UK law, including to write off expenses incurred on any issue of shares or debentures and to pay up fully paid
bonus shares. The share premium account is not distributable but may be reduced by special resolution of the
Company’s ordinary shareholders and with court approval.

**_Translation reserve_**

The results of overseas operations are translated at the average foreign exchange rates for the year, and their
balance sheets are translated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the
translation of opening net assets and results of overseas operations are recognised in the translation and hedging
reserve. All other exchange differences are included in the income statement.

**_Demerger reserve_**

The demerger reserve primarily reflects the profits or losses arising on the transfer of investments and net assets
of CPW on demerger.

**_Other reserve—Group ESOT_**

The Group ESOT held nine million shares at 31 March 2016 (2015: 33 million) in the Company for the benefit of
employees. During the period, the Trustees of the Group ESOT reassessed their holdings in relation to the
number of options expected to be exercised in the future. This resulted in the sale of 20 million shares, generating
net proceeds of £61m. The Group ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends and none of its shares have
been allocated to specific schemes. At the year end the shares had a market value of £22m (2015: £112m).

### 24. Commitments under operating leases

The Group leases network infrastructure and offices under non-cancellable operating leases. The leases have
varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights. There were no leases which were
individually significant to the Group.

The Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum payments due as follows:

### 25. Commitments

The Group has in the normal course of business entered into various multi-year supply and working capital
agreements for core network, IT and customer equipment. As at the 31 March 2016, expenditure contracted, but
not provided for in these financial statements amounted to £318m (2015: £450m). Of this amount, £55m (2015:
£85m) related to capital commitments and £25m (2015: £nil) related to the supply of customer equipment.

### 26. Related party transactions

**_a) Subsidiaries and joint ventures_**

Details of subsidiaries and joint ventures are disclosed in notes 13 and 14 respectively.

**_b) Directors_**

The remuneration of the Directors, who are some of the key management personnel of the Group, is set out in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 37 to 55. The remuneration of all key management personnel is
disclosed in note 4.

### 27. Contingent liabilities

As at 31 March 2014, the Group had received £33m in total in relation to an Ofcom determination that BT had
overcharged for certain wholesale Ethernet services. During the year ended 31 March 2015, BT lost its appeal
against Ofcom’s determination in the Competition Appeal Tribunal and appealed to the Court of Appeal. This
appeal is due to be heard in the Court of Appeal in March 2017. The Group considers the appeal is unlikely to
succeed based on the advice received and so no liability for repayment has been recorded at the year end,
although the outcome of the appeal is not yet certain.

### Independent auditor’s report to the members of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC

**Opinion on financial statements of** In our opinion:
**TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC**

                         - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of
the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at
31 March 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then
ended;

                        - the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;

                       - the Parent Company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice; and

                        - the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards
the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS
Regulation.

The financial statements comprise the Group income statement,
the Group statement of comprehensive income, the Group and
Parent Company balance sheets, the Group cash flow statement,
the Group statement of changes in equity, the Parent Company
reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and the
related notes 1 to 28. The financial reporting framework that has
been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements
is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the
preparation of the Parent Company financial statements
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

**Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as** As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, in
**issued by the IASB** addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union, the Group has also applied
IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
(IASB).

In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs
as issued by the IASB.

**Going concern** As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’
statement contained within the Chief Financial Officer’s
Statement that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:

                        - we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern
basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial
statements is appropriate; and

                        - we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast
significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going
concern.

F-73


-----

However, because not all future events or conditions can be
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s
ability to continue as a going concern.

**Our assessment of risks of material** The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are
**misstatement** those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the
allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the
engagement team.

**Risk** **How the scope of our audit responded to the risk**

**Revenue recognition**


Revenue represents a material balance
consisting of a high volume of individually
low value transactions and we have
identified the following types of transactions
and assertions related to revenue recognition
which give rise to key risks:

- the completeness of revenue recorded as
a result of the reliance on output of the
billing systems;

- the accuracy and completeness of revenue
recognised on transactions which are
outside the normal billing process, which
by their nature carry a higher level of
management judgement; and

 - the appropriateness of the allocation of
the total transaction value between
multiple elements in a bundled
transaction. The Group’s policy with
respect to bundled transactions is to limit
the revenue recognised for delivered
elements to the amounts billed, with
promotional credits deferred over the
contractual term.

See note 1 in the financial statements for
revenue recognition policy.

**Supplier rebates**

As disclosed in note 1 of the financial
statements, the Group periodically receives
commercial income, bonuses or other
rebates from suppliers. There is a risk that
these are incorrectly accounted for or
recognised in the wrong accounting period.


We tested the operating effectiveness of automated and
non-automated controls over the customer billing systems. Our
tests assessed the controls in place to ensure all services supplied
to customers are input into and processed through the billing
systems.

This enabled us to obtain assurance over billing systems
accounting for over 95% of total Group revenue. We
subsequently applied a combination of substantive analytical
review procedures and tests of detail to obtain assurance over the
validity and completeness of the reported output of these systems.

We performed substantive testing on a sample of non-systematic
adjustments which are outside of the normal billing process and
therefore carry higher levels of management judgement. These
included revenue deferrals and the write-back to the income
statement of credits applied to customer accounts.

We have assessed the appropriateness of this policy and also
performed substantive testing to confirm the fair value of
elements delivered up front is in excess of the amounts billable
and therefore appropriate application of their accounting policy.

We held discussions with the relationship managers for the major
suppliers across the Group and reviewed supplier accounts to
identify significant credits from suppliers. For significant credit
items we reviewed the relevant contracts to understand the terms
and conditions associated with the transaction and associated
commercial rationale. Based on our review of the contracts, we
have challenged management’s recognition of the accounting
treatment of credits recognised from suppliers and, where the
credits were significant, held discussions with the counterparty to
confirm our understanding of the commercial arrangement.

**Disclosure of exceptional items and the**
**presentation of adjusted measures in the**
**financial statements**

The disclosure of exceptional items and
their presentation on the face of the income
statement represents an audit risk given the
level of management judgement involved.
Areas of particular audit focus in the current
year are exceptional costs recognised in
relation to amounts recognisable in respect
of the historic termination charges
settlement (see note 9), operating
efficiencies, dual running costs, asset
impairments and customer migration
costs—all of which we deem to carry a
higher level of judgement.

Furthermore, the Group is challenging
HMRC’s interpretation of the VAT Prompt
Payment Discount rules. Determining the
likely outcome of any such disputes, and
therefore required provisions, is inherently
uncertain.

The nature of these costs has been defined in
note 9 to the accounts.

**Acquisition accounting**

There have been three significant
acquisitions in the year as described in
note 13 which included two customer base
acquisitions and a share purchase
acquisition with material fair value
adjustments. The transactions give rise to
cumulative goodwill of £11m and other
intangibles assets of £43m. The accounting
treatment for these acquisitions gives rise to
significant judgement around the fair value
adjustments, including the valuation of
intangible assets recognised, which include
determining appropriate inputs and
assumptions used in the underlying
valuations.

**Carrying value of goodwill and intangible**
**assets**

As disclosed in note 11 to the financial
statements the carrying value of goodwill on
the Group balance sheet as at 31 March
2015 is £490m. Management is required to
undertake an impairment review annually
or, if more frequent, whenever there is an
indication that the asset may be impaired.
This review incorporates judgements based
on assumptions of future cash flows,
including assumptions around revenue


In addition to understanding the composition of exceptional items
and agreeing a sample of items to supporting documentation, we
have challenged management’s rationale for the presentation of
items within the income statement as exceptional, particularly
around the areas of higher judgment such as ladder pricing to
assess if the exceptional credit is virtually certain and regarding
dual running and customer migration costs to determine whether
the costs recognised as exceptional meet the criteria of the
accounting policy for such items defined by the Group within
note 9. This includes assessing the incremental nature of the
costs, the extent to which the costs are non-recurring, whether
they are specific to individual projects and considering whether
they should be classified as part of underlying operations.

Regarding the VAT disputes, we have reviewed correspondence
with HMRC and with the support of our internal VAT specialists
we have critically challenged management’s assessment of the
likelihood of success and the completeness of their provisioning
and disclosure.

Our work has also included a review, on a sample basis, of items
included within the income statement to identify income and
expenses which may be exceptional by nature but not separately
identified. This has included consideration of credit balances
within underlying results.

We have considered management’s assessment that the acquired
assets represent a business combination under IFRS3 and
challenged management’s inputs and assumptions used in
determining the valuation and completeness of the acquired
intangible assets. This challenge specifically included the
consideration of the forecast cash flows expected to be generated
by the acquired assets, the anticipated rate of churn within the
underlying customer base and forecast revenue and cost metrics.
We have also challenged the appropriateness of the useful
economic life attributed to the assets.

We challenged management’s assumptions used in the
impairment model for goodwill and intangible assets, including
the determination of cash-generating units, the forecast cash flow
projections for each cash-generating unit and the discount rates
applied. In making this assessment of the cash flow projections
we assessed historical forecasting accuracy and compared
forecast profit margins to historical margins and benchmarked the
discount rate and growth rates employed to available market data.
We critically assessed management’s position as to whether or
not a reasonably possible change to key operating assumptions
could result in an impairment. In doing so we considered the
sensitivity of the asset valuations to these assumptions, in
particular changes to the long term growth rate assumed and the

F-75

growth, margins and forecast cash flows, the
selection of appropriate discount rates and
the assessment of the Group’s cashgenerating units.

**Treatment and presentation of tax**
**balances**

The accounting treatment and presentation
of the measurement of deferred tax assets
relating to losses acquired in Video
Networks (‘VNL’) of £29m (which have
been disclosed within note 7) is a
judgemental area. Specifically, the quantum
of losses to be recognised as a deferred tax
asset is dependent on future profitability and
the judgements within and reliance on
management forecasts.


growth of the TV and Fibre customer bases. We used our
specialist team to determine whether the discount rate used in the
calculations was appropriate. We also considered the
appropriateness of the related disclosures set out in note 11 to the
accounts.

We have reviewed correspondence with HMRC supporting the
availability of the VNL losses. With the use of our tax specialist
team we have challenged management’s forecasts of future
taxable profits to determine the appropriate quantum of VNL
losses to recognise as a deferred tax asset.


The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit
Committee discussed on page 27.

Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial
statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the
financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an
opinion on these individual matters.

**Our application of materiality** We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the
financial statements that makes it probable that the economic
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be
changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the
scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

We determined materiality for the Group to be £6m (2014: £6m),
which is approximately 7.3% (2014: 8.2%) of profit before tax
and exceptional items. Our materiality was set by blending
revenue and profit metrics. This approach was taken to make
allowance for the impact of subscriber acquisition costs related to
TV customers which has reduced current year earnings.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the
Committee all audit differences in excess of £120,000 (2014:
£120,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our
view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that
we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the
financial statements.

**An overview of the scope of our audit** Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the
Group and its environment, including group-wide controls, and
assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level.
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit scope
primarily on the TalkTalk Consumer and TalkTalk Business
operating units. Each of these was subject to a full audit and
represent over 95% (2014: over 95%) of the Group’s total assets
and revenues. Specific focused audit work was performed over
Group functions, including those covering treasury and taxation.
Our audit work at each division was executed at levels
of materiality which were lower than Group materiality.

-----

At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process
and carried out analytical procedures to confirm our conclusion
that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the
aggregated financial information of the remaining components
not subject to audit.

**Opinion on other matters prescribed by** In our opinion:
**the Companies Act 2006**

                        - the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited
has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 2006; and

                        - the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements
are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

**_Adequacy of explanations received and_** Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you
**_accounting records_** if, in our opinion:

                        - we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit; or

                       - adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been
received from branches not visited by us; or

                       - the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement
with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

**_Directors’ remuneration_** Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in
our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration have
not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.

**_Corporate Governance Statement_** Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of
the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s
compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance
Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.

**_Our duty to read other information in the_** Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we
**_Annual Report_** are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the
Annual Report is:

                        - materially inconsistent with the information in the audited
financial statements; or

                        - apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the
course of performing our audit; or

                       - otherwise misleading.

F-77


-----

In particular, we are required to consider whether we have
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired
during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider
the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and
whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters
that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not
identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.

**Respective responsibilities of Directors** As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities
**and auditor** Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true
and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an
opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland).
Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality
control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our
quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional
standards review team, strategically focused second partner
reviews and independent partner reviews.

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body,
in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state
to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state
to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.

**Scope of the audit of the financial** An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and
**statements** disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This
includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates
made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and
non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired
by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware
of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we
consider the implications for our report.

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements

 1. Accounting policies and basis of preparation

**_Basis of preparation_**

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union (EU) and as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. These financial statements therefore comply with
Article 4 of the European Union International Accounting Standard regulation. The Company has elected to
prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain
financial instruments and investments. The financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest
million, because that is the currency of the principal economic environment in which the Group operates.

**_Basis of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by
the Company (its subsidiaries) and entities which are joint ventures accounted for using the equity method made
up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included from or to the date on which control
passed to or was relinquished by the Group. Intercompany transactions and balances between subsidiaries are
eliminated on consolidation.

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries and the results of joint
ventures to bring accounting policies in line with those used by the Group.

**_Going concern_**

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Details of the considerations undertaken
by the Directors in reaching this conclusion are set out on page 14 within the Chief Financial Officer’s
Statement.

**_Accounting policies_**

The Group’s principal accounting policies, which relate to the financial statements as a whole, are set out below.
Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates. This
section also shows new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, whether these are
effective in the current or later years. In both cases it is explained how they are expected to impact the
performance of the Group.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is stated net of VAT and other sales-related taxes and represents the gross inflow of economic benefit
generated from the provision of fixed line, TV and mobile telecommunications services. All such revenue is
recognised as the services are provided:

 - line rental is recognised in the period to which it relates;

- voice and broadband subscriptions are recognised in the period to which they relate;

- usage including voice and TV content is recognised in the period in which the customer takes the service;

- promotional discounts and credits are amortised on a straight line basis over the minimum contract period
subject to an adjustment for in-contract churn; and

 - data service solutions and other service contracts are recognised as the Group fulfils its performance
obligations.

F-84


-----

Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. When the Group sells a number of
products within a bundled transaction, the total consideration from the arrangement is allocated to each element
based on their relative fair values. Management applies judgement in determining the amount of revenue the
Group recognises for delivered elements. This is limited to the amounts billed for that element.

**_Subscriber acquisition costs_**

Subscriber acquisition costs include both third party costs of recruiting and retaining new customers as well as
device costs. These are expensed as incurred.

**_Foreign currency translation and transactions_**

Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases or sales of the relevant currencies
and are recognised in the financial statements at the exchange rates thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are
recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ has been applied in the current and preceding financial year by
marking to market the relevant financial instruments at the balance sheet date and recognising the gain or loss
through other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow hedges.

The principal exchange rates against UK Sterling used in these financial statements are as follows:

**Average** **Closing**
**2015** **2014** **2015** **2014**

Euro **1.29** 1.19 **1.38** 1.21
United States Dollar **1.61** 1.60 **1.49** 1.67

**_Leases_**

Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the
period of the lease, even where payments are not made on such a basis. Lease incentives and rent free periods are
amortised through the income statement over the period of the lease term.

Gains or losses from sale and leaseback transactions are deferred over the life of the new lease to the extent that
the rentals are considered to be above or below market rentals. The remaining gain or loss is recognised within
operating expenses in the year in which the sale is completed.

**_Financial instruments_**

Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised in the Group balance
sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

_Trade and other receivables_

Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective
interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.

_Rebates receivable from suppliers_

Occasionally, the Group enters into agreements with certain suppliers for rebates on the cost of goods purchased.
Judgement is applied by management in these circumstances to ensure that the rebate is recognised over the
appropriate financial period.

Rebates from suppliers in the year related to renegotiated contract rates and compensation received under
existing contracts. Where these amounts relate to historical transactions, but negotiated in the current year, they
are recognised in the current year income statement.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits consist of cash in hand.

F-85


-----

_Trade payables_

Trade payables are other financial liabilities initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost.

_Financial liabilities and equity instruments_

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the
contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An
equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of
its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies adopted
for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.

_Loans and other borrowings_

Loans and other borrowings represent committed and uncommitted bank loans, US Private Placement notes and
bank overdrafts. These are initially measured at net proceeds and are subsequently measured at amortised cost,
using the effective interest rate method.

Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of external financing are capitalised and amortised over
the term of the relevant facility. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in
which they are incurred.

Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

_Equity instruments_

Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issuance costs.

Shares in the Company held by the Group ESOT are shown as a reduction in shareholders’ funds. Other assets
and liabilities held by the trust are consolidated with the assets of the Group.

_Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting_

The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The
use of financial derivatives is governed by the framework approved by the Board, which provides written
principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. Changes in
values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs in the
income statement. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently
remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no
longer qualifies for hedge accounting, or the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.

_Cash flow hedges_

The Group uses derivative instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to manage its interest rate risk. The Group
designates these as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these instruments is
recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the income statement.

_Measurement_

The financial instruments included on the Group balance sheet are measured at fair value or amortised cost. The
measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective and can depend on the inputs used in the
calculations. The different valuation methods are called ‘hierarchies’ and are described below:

 - Level 1: Fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities;

- Level 2: Fair values measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly; and

F-86


-----

 - Level 3: Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market
data.

**_Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s
accounting policies. Estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are continually
reviewed and revised as necessary. Whilst every effort is made to ensure that such estimates and assumptions are
reasonable, by their nature they are uncertain, and as such changes in estimates and assumptions may have a
material impact.

The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements
are set out in more detail in the related notes:

 - rebates receivable from suppliers (note 1);

- revenue recognition for bundled transactions (note 1);

 - taxation (note 7);

- exceptional items (note 9);

- impairment of goodwill (note 11);

 - valuation of acquisition intangibles (note 11);

 - capitalisation and useful economic lives of assets (notes 11 and 12);

- impairment of assets (notes 11 and 12); and

 - trade receivables (note 16).

**_Application of significant new or amended EU endorsed accounting standards_**

Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’, IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’,
IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’, IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’, IAS 24 ‘Related Party
Disclosures’, IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ and IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ became effective in the current
reporting period. These new and revised standards and interpretations have no material impact on the Group.

**_Future accounting developments_**

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, there were a number of significant standards and
interpretations that have not been applied in these financial statements, these were in issue, but not yet effective
(and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU).

The Directors expect that the following standards will have material impact on the financial statements of the
Group in future periods:

 - IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, impacting both the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments.

 - IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, impacting revenue recognition, related costs and
disclosures.

Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these
standards until a detailed review has been completed.

### 2. Segmental reporting

**_Accounting policy_**

IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires the segmental information presented in the financial statements to be that
used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of the business and decide how to

F-87


-----

allocate resources. The Group has identified the Board as its chief operating decision maker. The Board considers
the results of the business as a whole when assessing the performance of the business and making decisions about
the allocation of resources. Accordingly the Group has one operating segment.

Compensation for loss of office **0.2** —

**7.5** 6.8

### 5. Share-based payments

**_Accounting policy_**

The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and Executive Directors. Equitysettled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period,
based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.

Fair value is measured by use of a dividend discount or Binomial model for share-based payments with internal,
non-market performance criteria (for example, EPS targets) and a Black Scholes or Monte Carlo model for those
with external performance criteria (for example, TSR targets).

For schemes with non-market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is recalculated at each
balance sheet date, based on expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting. The
movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement,
with a corresponding entry in reserves.

For schemes with market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is adjusted only for
expectations of leavers prior to vesting. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet
date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.

F-89


-----

If a scheme is cancelled, any remaining part of the fair value of the scheme is expensed immediately. If a scheme
is forfeited, no further expense is recognised and any charges previously recognised are reversed.

Charges arise on loans that are provided to employees to fund the purchase of shares in the Group as part of long
term incentive plans. To the extent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable, the cost of
such loans is expensed over the course of the relevant incentive plans. Charges are also recognised on loans
provided to employees to settle personal tax liabilities. To the extent to which the loans are not, in certain
circumstances, repayable, the cost of such loans is expensed on grant.

**_Group share schemes_**

The Group’s share schemes are the Shareholder Value Plan (SVP), Discretionary Share Option Plan (DSOP),
Save-As-You-Earn scheme (SAYE) and Share Match scheme (SIP).

In order to aid the user of the accounts, the dilutive effect on EPS of each of the Group schemes has been
presented. This has been calculated using an average share price for the financial year of £3.00 (2014: £2.67).

In June 2014, the Group made awards under the SVP and the DSOP schemes, under rules previously approved by
shareholders. Further information is set out in sections (i) and (ii) of this note. The TTG Value Enhancement
Scheme (VES) and CPW TTG VES have fully vested in the prior year; therefore, disclosures are limited to the
dilutive effect on EPS and the number of outstanding options in the prior year.

**_TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC schemes_**

_(i) TTG SVP_

On 18 June 2014, the Company made awards in the SVP, operating under the VES rules previously approved by
shareholders. Subsequent awards were made to new joiners of the Group in December 2014, February and March
2015. The Group advanced loans to participants to enable them to purchase participation shares in TalkTalk
Group Limited, the holding company of the Group’s operating business. The SVP is a growth plan and not a
share option plan. These loans are subject to a commercial rate of interest set by HMRC. The SVP
enables participants to share in up to 7% of any increase in the value of the Group over an opening market
capitalisation of £2,941m based on a five business day average up to 3 June 2014. The awards are subject to the
following performance conditions:

- at least a 7% compound annual increase (CAGR) in the market capitalisation of the Group from the above
valuation over a three and four-year period; and

- the Group’s TSR outperforms the FTSE 250.

The performance conditions are measured over an initial performance period from 3 June 2014 to the date of
announcement of the Group’s FY17 annual results after which a total of 60% of the options will vest. The
remaining options are measured over a performance period from 3 June 2014 to the date of announcement of the
Group’s FY18 annual results. Participation shares are forfeited for the value of the outstanding loan plus accrued
interest, if an employee leaves the Group before the scheme vests. The Pool also has a maximum cap on
incremental value equal to 2.75% of the total issued share capital of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC at the date of
each vesting.

There is a holding period on 100% of the PLC Shares received in exchange for participation shares on vesting, of
twelve months from each vesting date for Executive Directors. All other participants are required to hold 50% of
the PLC Shares received in exchange for participation shares on vesting for twelve months from each vesting
date.

A fair value exercise was conducted for the award using the Monte Carlo method with the total fair value of the
participation shares granted totalling £6m. The resulting IFRS 2 charge for the year ended 31 March 2015 is
£1.6m.

_(ii) DSOP—2014 grant_

In June 2014, the Group granted eight million nil-priced share option awards subject to the following
performance conditions:

- at least a 7% compound annual increase (CAGR) in the market capitalisation of the Group from the above
valuation over the next three and four year periods; and

- the Group’s TSR outperforms the FTSE 250.

The options are measured over a performance period from 3 June 2014 to 3 June 2017 and will vest on
announcement of the Group’s FY17 annual results. A total of 60% of the vested options are exercisable from the
vesting date, with the remaining 40% of options being exercisable twelve months later. Options are forfeited if an
employee leaves the Group before the options vest, subject to the DSOP scheme rules. Subsequent awards were
made to new joiners of the Group in December 2014 and February 2015.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of the DSOP—2014 grant is 9.2 years.

_(iii) DSOP—2013 grant_

In FY14, the Group granted six million nil-priced share option awards subject to absolute TSR and EPS
performance targets. The options are measured over a performance period to 31 March 2016 and will vest on the
announcement of the Group’s FY16 annual results. A total of 60% of the vested options are exercisable from the
vesting date, with the remaining 40% of options being exercisable twelve months later. Options are forfeited if an
employee leaves the Group before the options vest subject to the DSOP scheme rules. Awards are triggered
within a range from 5% to 26% for compound annual growth of TSR and EPS. If the minimum performance
requirement is met a total of 25% of the award will vest, rising to 40% for target, 70% for stretch and 100% for
super stretch.

_(iv) DSOP—2012 grant_

Nil-priced share option awards made under the DSOP 2012 grant are subject to absolute TSR and EPS
performance targets with a cap and collar to address volatility in the market, as detailed in the Directors’
Remuneration Report. The options are measured over a performance period to 31 March 2015 and will vest on
the announcement of the Group’s FY15 annual results. A total of 60% of the vested options are exercisable from
the vesting date, with the remaining 40% of options being exercisable twelve months later. Options are forfeited
if an employee leaves the Group before the options vest. Awards are triggered within a range from 10% to 19%
for compound annual growth of TSR and EPS. If the minimum performance requirement is met a total of 25% of
the award will vest, rising to 40% for target, 70% for stretch and 100% for super stretch.

- In accordance with the scheme rules, the final performance of the DSOP 2012 was measured on 31 March 2015. It was confirmed that
performance against the EPS measure fell below the minimum threshold and was missed, but that performance against the TSR measure
exceeded Super Stretch and was hit. 50% of the DSOP 2012 will therefore vest on 14 May 2015, with 60% of the vested options being
available to exercise from this date and the remaining 40% available to exercise on 14 May 2016.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of the DSOP—2012 grant is 6.9 years (2014: 7.9 years).

_(v) DSOP—2010 grant_

Awards made under the DSOP—2010 grant were subject to TSR performance targets and were measured over a
performance period to 28 March 2013. Options were forfeited if an employee left the Group before the options
vested. On 28 March 2013, all options vested subject to the DSOP scheme rules but they were not exercisable
until after the preliminary announcement on 16 May 2013.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of the DSOP—2010 grant is 5.6 years (2014: 6.0 years).

_(vi) SAYE_

The scheme permits the granting of options to employees linked to a bank SAYE contract for a term of three or
five years. Contributions from UK employees range from £5 to £250 per month for schemes launched between
2010 and 2013 and between £5 and £500 per month for the 2014 scheme onwards. Options may be exercised at
the end of the three or five year period at an exercise price determined at the invitation date. The scheme is
available for a period each year for employees to join.

Exercise prices for the schemes are set out below:

2014 grant 240p per share
2013 grant 192p per share
2012 grant 123p per share
2011 grant 119p per share

_(vii) Share Match_

The Group launched its first all-employee, HMRC approved Share Match Plan (SIP) in June 2014, following the
Remuneration Committee approval of this scheme in the year ending 31 March 2014. This enables eligible
employees to purchase market priced shares by entering into a partnership share agreement and holding such
shares in trust for up to a five year period. The rules of the Plan allow an employee maximum contribution of
£1,800 per annum, or in line with HMRC limits if these are increased. Approval for the TTG Share Match was
granted by shareholders at the AGM on 24 July 2013.

The Remuneration Committee, at its discretion may award matching and/or free shares to eligible participants.
Matching shares may be granted up to a maximum ratio of two matching shares for each partnership share
purchased by a participant. Free shares may be awarded up to a maximum value of £3,600 tax free per annum, or
in line with HMRC limits if these are increased.

Currently the Group provides one matching share for each partnership share purchased by participating
employees or Executive Directors. During the year ended 31 March 2015, the impact of Share Match scheme on
the Group’s results was not material.

### 6. Finance income and costs

Finance costs are analysed as follows:

**2015** **2014**
**£m** **£m**

Interest on bank loans and overdrafts **17** 16
Facility fees and similar charges **5** 4

**22** 20

During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group refinanced its term loan and revolving credit facility with bank
debt and US Private Placement notes and paid £5m in respect of arrangement and legal fees. The fees are being
amortised over the expected life of the loan and notes and are included within facility fees and similar charges
above, along with the accelerated amortisation of the arrangement fees on the previous re-financing. The average
interest rate in the year was 3.00% (2014: 3.39%).

### 7. Taxation

**_Accounting policy_**

Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or
recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the
balance sheet and its tax base.

Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, and
the carry-forward of unused tax losses and credits. Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised. Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except
where it relates to an item recognised directly in reserves, in which case it is recognised directly in reserves.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.

**_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_**

The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to which taxable profits are generated in the
relevant jurisdictions for the foreseeable future, and on the tax legislation then in force, and as such the value of
associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.

The tax charge on Headline earnings for the year ended 31 March 2015 is £19m (2014: £13m), representing an
effective tax rate on pre-tax profits of 20% (2014: 18%). The tax credit on Statutory earnings for the year ended
31 March 2015 is £40m (2014: £3m). The reconciliation between the Headline and Statutory tax charge is shown
in note 9.

The principal differences between the tax charge and the amount calculated by applying the standard rate of UK
corporation tax of 21% (2014: 23%) to the profit before tax are as follows:

No deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in either year, except where there is a legal right to do so in
the relevant jurisdictions.

During the year, the Company reviewed the period over which it recognises assets in respect of brought forward
tax losses and revised this from five years to ten years due to the increased stability of the TV proposition. The
incremental movement of £29m has been recognised through exceptional items.

At 31 March 2015, the Group had unused tax losses of £674m (2014: £702m) available for offset against future
taxable profits. A deferred tax asset of £69m (2014: £39m) has been recognised in respect of £347m (2014:
£197m) of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £327m (2014: £505m) as there is
insufficient evidence that there will be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered. All
losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

### 8. Dividends

**_Accounting policy_**

Dividend income is recognised when payment has been received. Final dividend distributions are recognised as a
liability in the financial statements in the year in which they are approved by the relevant shareholders. Interim
dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid.

The following dividends were paid by the Group to its shareholders:

**2015** **2014**
**£m** **£m**
**Ordinary dividends**
Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2013 of 6.95p per ordinary share **—** 62
Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2014 of 4.00p per ordinary share **—** 37
Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2014 of 8.00p per ordinary share **74** —
Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2015 of 4.60p per ordinary share **42** —

**Total ordinary dividends** **116** 99

F-96


-----

The proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2015 of 9.2p per ordinary share on approximately
922 million ordinary shares (approximately £85m) was approved by the Board on 13 May 2015 and will be
recommended to shareholders at the AGM in July. The dividend has not been included as a liability as at
31 March 2015.

The Group ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends in the current and prior year and this is reflected in
the analysis above.

### 9. Reconciliation of Headline information to Statutory information

Headline information is provided because the Directors consider that it provides assistance in understanding the
Group’s underlying performance.

**_Accounting policy_**

Headline results are stated before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items. Exceptional
items are those that are considered to be one-off or non-recurring in nature and so material that the Directors
believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid distortion of underlying performance and should be
separately presented on the face of the income statement.

**_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_**

The classification of items as exceptional is subjective in nature and therefore judgement is required to determine
whether the item is in line with the accounting policy criteria outlined above. Determining whether an item is
exceptional is a matter of qualitative assessment, making it distinct from the Group’s other critical accounting
judgements where the basis for judgement is estimation.

payment discounts and historic termination charge settlements with the Mobile Network Operators. The net
impact of these two items is not material. (2014: -£5m).

_b) Operating efficiencies—Making TalkTalk Simpler (MTTS)_

During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group has continued its simplification and cost reduction programmes
to drive a seamless and efficient customer experience and provide the business with operations and processes that
are fit for purpose.

F-97


-----

The costs incurred in the year included work on improving Consumer and TalkTalk Business customer
operations, services and rationalising customer tariffs and exiting Group legacy products and access methods.

These programmes have resulted in £29m (2014: £20m) of costs including project management, consultancy,
migration and call centre costs.

A total taxation credit of £7m has been recognised on these costs in the year ended 31 March 2015 (2014: £5m).

_c) Acquisitions and disposal_

During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group acquired broadband and voice customer bases from both Virgin
Media Limited (‘Virgin Media’) and Tesco Stores Limited (‘Tesco’) and acquired blinkbox Entertainment
Limited (‘blinkbox’). The Group has incurred costs for the migration of customers onto the Group’s network and
integration costs including redundancy. The total charge incurred in the year ended 31 March 2015 was £4m
(2014: £nil).

Further to this, the Group has provided for £10m of costs in respect of committed future programmes
predominantly in respect of migration, reorganisation and related costs.

In addition, on 24 December 2014, the Group disposed of its existing off-net broadband customer base to Fleur
Telecom Limited, a member of Daisy Communications Group. This transaction generated £5m profit to the
Group.

A total taxation credit of £2m (2014: £nil) has been recognised in relation to these items in the year ended
31 March 2015.

_d) Mobile Migration_

As part of the plan to build a scale quad-play business, during the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group has
entered into a new multi-year commercial MVNO agreement with Telefónica UK, where by Telefónica UK will
provide TalkTalk with access to 4G and national roaming services in the UK. As a result, the Group provided for
£8m (2014: £nil) of costs in respect of committed future mobile migration programmes from the existing network
provider to Telefónica UK predominantly in respect of SIM replacement, customer communications and related
costs.

A total taxation credit of £2m (2014: £nil) has been recognised on these costs in the year ended 31 March 2015.

_e) Impairment loss_

As a result of the MTTS exceptional projects, an £11m impairment charge has been recognised in respect of a
number of systems to be decommissioned or replaced before the end of their useful economic life. £5m (2014:
£nil) of this impairment charge related to equipment and has been included within exceptional depreciation and
the remaining £6m (2014: £nil) related to a billing system and has been included in exceptional amortisation on
the face of the Group income statement.

A total taxation credit of £2m (2014: £nil) has been recognised on these costs in the year ended 31 March 2015.

_f) Amortisation of acquisition intangibles_

An amortisation charge in respect of acquisition intangibles of £6m was incurred in the year ended 31 March
2015 (2014: £21m). The Tiscali customer base was fully amortised in the year.

A total taxation credit of £1m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2015 (2014: £5m).

_g) Tax items_

The Group has recognised tax credits of £45m (2014: £nil) comprising a further £29m in respect of VNL tax
losses following the increase in the time period used to recognise losses from five to ten years and £16m for the
resolution of legacy demerger items (note 7).

### 11. Goodwill and other intangible assets

**_(a) Goodwill_**

_Accounting policy_

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing the excess of the fair
value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recognised
initially as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss
on disposal.

_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_

The Group has two CGUs—Consumer and TalkTalk Business. For the purpose of impairment testing, at the
acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the
acquisition. The Group’s shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are
allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows that those shared costs support.

Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the
CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates to use to calculate present values.

_Impairment of goodwill_

Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication
that the asset may be impaired; this review is performed at a CGU level.

Impairment is determined by assessing the future cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill relates. The
future cash flows of the Group are taken from the Board approved five-year plan and extrapolated out to 20 years

F-99


-----

based on the UK’s long term growth rate. This is discounted by the CGU’s weighted average cost of capital
pre-tax to give the net present value of that CGU. Where the net present value of future cash flows is less than the
carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.

Sensitivity analysis is performed using reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions.

**Closing cost and net book value** **490** **479**

The goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the CGUs that are expected to
benefit from that business combination. The allocation of goodwill across the CGUs is as follows:

**2015** **2014**
**£m** **£m**
Consumer **348** 337
TalkTalk Business **142** 142

**490** 479

_Impairment review_

The key assumptions used in the Group’s goodwill impairment review are as follows:

**• Long term growth rates**

Long term revenue growth rates applied are based on the growth rate for the UK per the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The rate applied in the current year was 2.2% (2014: 1.7%).

**• Discount rate**

The underlying discount rate for each CGU is based on the UK ten-year gilt rate adjusted for an equity risk
premium and the systematic risk of the CGU. The average pre-tax rate for both CGUs used to discount the
forecast cash flows is 9.0% (2014: 8.4%). The assumptions used in the calculation of the CGUs’ discount rate are
benchmarked to externally available data. The same discount rate has been applied to both CGUs due to the
similarity of risk factors and geographical location.

**• Capital expenditure**

Forecast capital expenditure is based on senior management expectations of future required support of the
network and current run rate of expenditure, typically at 6% of revenue.

**• Customer factors**

The key assumptions for the forecast cash flows of each of the CGUs are based on expected customer growth
rates, ARPU, direct costs including acquisition costs, and change in product mix. The value assigned to each of
these assumptions has been determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends in the Group and external
information on expected trends of future market developments.

Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and the Directors have not identified any
reasonably possible material changes in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to
exceed the recoverable amount.

**_(b) Other intangible assets_**

_Accounting policy_

**Operating intangibles**

Operating intangibles include internal infrastructure and design costs incurred in the development of software for
internal use. Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately
identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, and the development cost can be
measured reliably. Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in
the year in which it is incurred. Operating intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated
useful economic lives of up to eight years.

**Acquisition intangibles**

Acquired intangible assets such as customer bases and other intangible assets acquired through a business
combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and amortised over their expected useful lives of up to
six years on a straight line basis. The value attributed to such assets is based on the future economic benefit that
is expected to be derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash flows after a deduction for
contributory assets.

_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_

**Impairment**

At the acquisition date, acquisition intangibles are allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the
synergies of the combination. The Group’s shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central
overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows.

Determining whether the carrying amounts of operating and acquisition intangibles have any indication of
impairment requires judgement. If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to
assess whether the carrying amounts can be supported by the value in use of the CGU that the asset is allocated
to.

The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of
appropriate discount rates to use to calculate present values.

**Useful economic lives**

The assessment of the useful economic lives of these operating and acquisition intangibles requires judgement.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement based on the useful economic life selected. This assessment
requires estimation of the period over which the Group will benefit from the assets.

_Impairment of assets_

The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that
those assets have suffered an impairment loss at each reporting date. Where an indicator of impairment exists, the
Group makes a formal estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount and the extent of any impairment loss.

The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the
asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.

**Closing balance at 31 March 2014** 135 6 141

_Operating intangibles_

Operating intangibles includes internally generated assets with a net book value of £59m (2014: £39m), which
are amortised over a period of up to eight years. This includes additions of £31m (2014: £15m) and an
amortisation charge of £10m (2014: £7m) in the year ended 31 March 2015.

Included within operating intangibles is the following asset, which is material to the Group:

- TRIO, the customer billing system, which has a net book value of £66m (2014: £76m). TRIO is amortised
over a period of up to eight years depending on the release date of the relevant component. The weighted
average remaining useful economic life of the components of TRIO is three years (2014: four years).

_Acquisition intangibles_

At 31 March 2015, the acquisition intangibles relate to the broadband customer bases acquired from Virgin
Media and Tesco in October 2014 and January 2015 respectively (see note 13). The valuation of customer bases
is derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from them, after a deduction for contributory assets.

The value of these broadband customer bases is material to the Group with net book value of £38m. The useful
economic life of acquired customer bases is five years from the date of acquisition. The Tiscali customer base
was fully amortised in the year.

The remaining £4m of acquisition intangibles relate to the website acquired as part of the blinkbox transaction in
January 2015 (see note 13). The website is valued using replacement method and has a remaining useful
economic life of three years.

### 12. Property, plant and equipment

**_Accounting policy_**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less
estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life from the date it is
brought into use, as follows:

Short leasehold improvements 10% or the lease term if less than ten years
Network equipment and computer hardware 12.5–50% per annum
Fixtures and fittings 20–25% per annum

**_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_**

The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires judgement. Depreciation is charged to the
income statement based on the useful economic life selected. This assessment requires estimation of the period
over which the Group will benefit from the assets.

Determining whether the carrying amount of these assets has any indication of impairment also requires
judgement. If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the
carrying amount can be supported by the value in use of the CGU to which the asset is allocated. The value in use
calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate
discount rates to use to calculate present values (note 11).

**_Impairment of assets_**

_Property, plant and equipment_

The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its fixed assets to determine whether there is any indication that
those assets have suffered an impairment loss at each reporting date. The Group uses the same methodology as
set out in note 11 for operating and acquisition intangibles.

### 13. Non-current asset investments

**_Accounting policy_**

Investments, other than subsidiaries, are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration
given plus any transaction costs associated with the acquisition.

Investments are categorised as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value, together
with any related taxation, are taken directly to equity, and recycled to the income statement when the investment
is sold or determined to be impaired.

Non-current asset investments at 31 March 2015 related to a 7.3% (2014: 7.3%) interest in Shared Band Limited,
a telecommunications technology provider. The cost of the investment is not material.

_(a) Principal investments_

The Parent Company has investments in the following subsidiary undertakings, which principally affected the
profits or losses or net assets of the Group. To avoid a statement of excessive length, details of investments that
are not significant have been omitted. All holdings are in equity share capital and give the Group an effective
holding of 100% on consolidation.

_(b) Acquisitions and disposals_

**(i) Acquisitions**

The Group has made the following acquisitions during the year ended 31 March 2015:

**Virgin Media broadband customer base acquisition**

On 27 October 2014, the Group acquired the Virgin Media broadband service business from Virgin Media which
comprises broadband customers (MPF, SMPF and IP Stream). The acquisition is complementary to the Group’s
existing business model. The legal title of asset was transferred as the customers migrated to the Group’s network
which substantially took place in the period from December 2014 to March 2015. As this is an acquisition of
customer base, nil voting shares were acquired. The provisional goodwill represents the future economic benefit
arising from the aligning of customers’ existing products with the Group’s products and its fit with existing
operations. Provisional goodwill has been allocated to the Consumer Cash Generating Unit (CGU).

**Tesco broadband and voice customer base acquisition**

On 7 January 2015, the Group acquired the Tesco broadband service business from Tesco which comprises
broadband (MPF, SMPF and IP Stream) and voice customers. The acquisition is complementary to the Group’s
existing business model. The legal title of asset was transferred on 1 March 2015. As this is an acquisition of
customer base, nil voting shares were acquired. The provisional goodwill relation to the future economic benefit
arising from aligning the customers’ existing products with the Group’s products and its fit with existing
operations. Provisional goodwill has been allocated to the Consumer Cash Generating Unit (CGU).

**blinkbox acquisition**

On 7 January 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued and voting share capital of blinkbox from
Tesco Holdings Limited. The acquisition is complementary to the Group’s existing business model. blinkbox
provides movies and TV series online for customers to stream or download on demand.

Fair value adjustments relate principally to:

 - the write down of internally developed software to its fair value; and

- provisions for onerous contracts.

The book value of the current assets is expected to equal their fair value.

The provisional goodwill of £5m relates to the future opportunities arising from the nature of the business,
particularly around the knowledge of creating on demand TV platforms, and fit with the Group’s existing
operations. The provisional goodwill has been allocated to the Consumer CGU.

F-105


-----

All the acquisitions were carried out by in house functions therefore the impact of external adviser fees relating
to the acquisition in the Group’s results was £nil. Other acquisition costs are set out in note 9.

All of the goodwill generated from acquisitions is expected to be deductible for Corporation tax purposes.

In the prior year, the Group acquired the remaining 75% of the issued share capital of Future Office
Communications Limited (note 22).

**(ii) Disposals**

On 24 December 2014, the Group agreed to dispose of its existing off-net broadband customer base to Fleur
Telecom Limited (Fleur), a member of Daisy Communications Group, for a contingent consideration of £8m
generating a profit on disposal of £5m. The expected cost to sell of £3m has been included within the Group’s
trade and other payable balance on the consolidated balance sheet. The consideration is contingent on
the performance of this customer base in the period of 24 months following the network migration completion
date.

The customer base was derecognised from the balance sheet at completion date, 31 March 2015.

There were no disposals in the prior year.

**(iii) Asset held for sale**

As at 31 March 2015, the Group agreed to sell the acquired off-net broadband base from Virgin Media and Tesco
to Fleur. The transaction is expected to complete in the year ending 31 March 2016. These bases therefore met
the definition of asset held for sale under IFRS 5 and has been included as part of trade and other receivables
balance on the Group consolidated balance sheet (£1m). The carrying value of these assets was based on the
selling price of the disposal transaction; therefore no gain or loss is recognised as a result of this classification.

### 14. Interest in joint ventures

**_Accounting policy_**

Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The Group income statement includes the
Group’s share of the post-tax profits or losses of the joint ventures based on their financial statements for the
year.

In the Group balance sheet, the Group’s interest in joint ventures is shown as a non-current asset, representing the
Group’s investment in the share capital of the joint ventures, as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the
Group’s share of the net assets or liabilities less provision for any impairment.

In addition to the carrying amount of the investment, the Group’s interest in joint ventures includes, where
applicable, any long term interests in the venture that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in
the joint venture. An item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is,
in substance, an extension of the Group’s interest in that joint venture.

Any loans advanced to a joint venture that, in substance, do not form part of the Group’s net investment are
shown separately in the balance sheet, as a receivable to the Group. Losses recognised using the equity method in
excess of the Group’s investment in ordinary shares are applied to the other components of the Group’s interest
in the joint venture in the reverse order of their seniority (i.e. priority in liquidation).

**YouView TV Limited (‘YouView’)**

The Group holds 14.3% (2014: 14.3%) of the ordinary share capital of YouView, a joint venture with The British
Broadcasting Corporation, ITV Broadcasting Limited, British Telecom PLC (BT), Channel Four Television
Corporation, Arqiva Limited and Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited. The joint venture was set up in order to
develop a free-to-air internet-connected TV service to UK homes. During the year ended 31 March 2015, the
Group signed a new agreement with the other existing holders of YouView whereby all seven original partners
(together ‘Tier 1’ funders) continue to contribute approximately £1m per annum to basic operational and
technology costs of YouView, and the Group together with BT as ‘Tier 2’ funders, contribute up to a further
£10m per annum for additional development of the technology to support their TV propositions. The Group’s
total contribution to YouView in the year ended 31 March 2015 was £8m (2014: £5m).

F-106


-----

There was no change in the overall control of the joint venture as a result of these changes as all seven partners
share overall control. Under this agreement, the Group’s share of losses comprises one-seventh of any Tier 1 loss
and half of any Tier 2 loss. During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group recognised £8m share of losses
(2014: £7m).

The Group has reviewed the carrying value of YouView and has concluded that there is no indication of
impairment.

**Bolt Pro Tem Limited**

The Group holds 33% of the ordinary shares capital of Bolt Pro Tem Limited (‘BPT’), a joint venture with
British Sky Broadcasting Limited (‘BSkyB’) and City Fibre Holdings Limited. The joint venture was set up in
FY15 to deliver fibre to the premise (‘FTTP’) broadband services in the City of York. The Group has committed
to contribute £5m over the three-year period to 31 March 2017. In FY15, the joint venture started to build a trial
network in York. During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group contributed £3m to the joint venture and
received £nil share of losses.

The Group has reviewed the carrying value of BPT and has concluded that there is no indication of impairment.

**Internet Matters**

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group, alongside BSkyB, BT and Virgin Media established an equal
membership joint venture, Internet Matters Limited. It is a not-for-profit company, set up as an industry-led body
to promote and educate parents about internet safety for children. The Group is committed to contribute £2m
over the period to 31 March 2017.

**_Accounting policy_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, valued on a FIFO basis, and consists primarily
of set top boxes, handsets and routers. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less costs expected
to be incurred. A provision is made for obsolete items where appropriate.

### 16. Trade and other receivables

**_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_**

Judgement is required in order to evaluate the likelihood of collection of customer debt after revenue has been
recognised and hence the value of the bad and doubtful debt. These provisions are based on historical trends in
the percentage of debts which are not recovered.

Trade and other receivables comprise:

**2015** **2014**
**£m** **£m**

Current—trade and other receivables
Trade receivables—gross **178** 169
Less provision for impairment **(25)** (34)

Trade receivables—net **153** 135
Other receivables **89** 63
Prepayments and accrued income **80** 62
Assets held for sale **1** —

**Trade and other receivables** **323** 260

The Directors estimate that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates to their fair value.

The average credit period taken on trade receivables, calculated by reference to the amount owed at the year-end
as a proportion of total revenue in the year, was 30 days (2014: 30 days).

The Group’s trade receivables are denominated in the following currencies:

**2015** **2014**
**£m** **£m**

UK Sterling **166** 146
Other **12** 23

**178** 169

The ageing of gross trade receivables is as follows:

Receivables written off as irrecoverable **71** 51

**(25)** (34)

Trade receivables of £59m (2014: £63m) were past due, but not impaired. These balances primarily relate to
Consumer and TalkTalk Business fixed line customers. The Group has made provisions based on historical rates
of recoverability and all unprovided amounts are considered to be recoverable. The ageing analysis of these trade
receivables is as follows:

**2015** **2014**
**£m** **£m**

0 to 2 months **19** 12
2 to 4 months **19** 13

**516** 456

The Group has commercially agreed longer credit terms with certain suppliers. Excluding these suppliers, the
underlying average credit period taken on trade payables was 33 days (2014: 32 days). Including these suppliers,
the average credit period taken was 43 days (2014: 42 days).

Any supplier rebates are accounted for in accordance with the policy set out in note 1.

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other payables approximates to their fair value.

**599** 460

Details of the current and non-current borrowing facilities of the Group for the year are set out below.

_Bank overdrafts_

Overdraft facilities are used to assist in short term cash management; these uncommitted facilities bear interest at
a margin over the Bank of England base rate.

**$185m US Private Placement (USPP) Notes**

In July 2014 the Group issued $185m of USPP notes maturing in 3 tranches ($139m 2021, $25m 2024, $21m
2026). The interest rate payable on the notes is at a margin over US treasury rate for the appropriate period. The
USPP proceeds were swapped to £109m (£82m 2021, £15m 2024, £12m 2026) and the net debt includes
retranslation of the USPP funds at the rates achieved where hedged by cross currency swaps.

**£560m revolving credit facility (RCF) and £50m bilateral agreement**

The Group has a £560m RCF, which matures in July 2019. The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under
this facility is at a margin over LIBOR and for the appropriate period. The actual margin applicable to any
drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.
In addition to the RCF, the Group also has a £50m bilateral agreement which matures in July 2019.

**£100m term loan**

The Group has a committed term loan of £100m (2014: £75m), with a final maturity date of July 2019. This loan
amortises over the term with repayments due of £25m in January 2017, £25m in January 2018 and the remainder
in July 2019. The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR for
the relevant currency and for the appropriate period. The actual margin applicable to any drawing depends on the
ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.

The Group’s facilities total £819m (excluding the translation impact). The financial covenants included in each
facility are identical; they restrict the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and require minimum levels of interest cover.

The Group was in compliance with its covenants throughout the current and prior year.

_Borrowing facilities_

The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at the end of the year, in respect of which all conditions
precedent had been met, as follows:

### 19. Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments

The book value and fair value of the Group’s financial assets, liabilities and derivative financial instruments,
excluding the Group’s loans and other borrowings shown in note 18, are as follows:

**2015** **2014**
**£m** **£m**

**Current assets**
Cash and cash equivalents **10** —
Trade and other receivables* **312** 260
Derivative financial instruments* **11** —
**Non-current assets**
Non-current investments and investment in joint venture **10** 7
**Current liabilities**
Bank overdrafts **—** (7)
Trade and other payables** **(516)** (456)

**(173)** (196)

- Derivative financial instruments are included with other receivables in note 16.
** Deferred income has been included within the financial liabilities above so as to give completeness over the Group’s contractual
commitments on future cash outflows.

**_(a) Financial instruments_**

The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including market risk (such as currency risk and
interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group Treasury function uses certain financial instruments to
mitigate potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance from these risks. These financial
instruments primarily consist of bank loans and interest rate swaps. Other products, such as currency options, can
also be used depending on the risks to be covered, but have not been used in the current or preceding financial
year. The Group does not trade or speculate in any financial instruments.

The Group has cash flow hedges in place to (a) swap the interest rate risk on the RCF from floating to fixed and
(b) swap the currency and interest rate risk on the USPP debt from USD to GBP and from fixed US Treasury
interest rates to fixed GBP interest rates. These hedges have been fully effective from inception. The fair value
measurement is classified as Level 2 (FY14: Level 2), derived from other observable market data; this means that
their fair value is based upon the mark to market valuation at the balance sheet date. Fair value measurement at
Level 2 gives consideration to interest rates, yield curves and foreign exchange rates at commonly quoted
intervals for relevant currencies. The Group has also assessed the credit risk within its financial instruments. The
fair value of these instruments at 31 March 2015 is £11m (2014: £nil). A loss of £5m (2014: gain of £3m) has
been recognised in other comprehensive income in the year ended 31 March 2015. As the hedges were fully
effective there has been no income statement impact.

**_(b) Embedded derivatives_**

No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and accordingly no such derivatives have been
accounted for separately.

F-111


-----

**_(c) Foreign exchange risk_**

The Group uses spot and forward foreign exchange trading to hedge transactional exposures, which arise mainly
through cost of sales and operating expenses, and are primarily denominated in Euro and US Dollar. The Group
also uses cross currency swaps to hedge its US Dollar denominated borrowings (US Private Placement). At
31 March 2015 the adjustment to translate our net debt to Sterling at swap rates to reflect the impact of hedging
was £16m (2014: £nil).

Borrowings and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates; this sensitivity
can be analysed in comparison to year-end rates. There was no material impact of a 10% movement in the UK
Sterling/Euro exchange rate on either the income statement or other equity. The effect of foreign exchange
derivatives on borrowings at the year-end was as follows:

**UK Sterling** **Euro** **USD** **Total**
**£m** **£m** **£m** **£m**

**2015**
Borrowings before derivatives **490** **—** **125** **615**
Derivatives **—** **—** **(16)** **(16)**

**490** **—** **109** **599**

**UK Sterling** **Euro** **USD** **Total**
**£m** **£m** **£m** **£m**

**2014**
Borrowings before derivatives 497 — — 497
Derivatives (7) 10 (3) —

490 10 (3) 497

During the year, the Group used derivatives for the management of US private placement debt, foreign currency
cash balances and foreign currency trading balances.

**_(d) Interest rate risk_**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at
floating rates of interest and thus expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. These floating rates are linked
to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency. Future cash flows arising
from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods for each loan or rollover. As detailed
in section (a), the Group has cash flow hedges in place to mitigate its interest rate risk on its borrowings.

Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and
such movements have been analysed in the table below by calculating the effect on the income statement and
equity of one percentage point movement in the interest rate for the currencies in which most Group cash and
borrowings are denominated. Funding to related parties has been offset against gross borrowings in calculating
these sensitivities. This annualised analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the year-end positions
prevail throughout the year, and therefore may not be representative of fluctuations in levels of borrowings.

**2015** **2014**
**£m** **£m**

**1% movement in the UK Sterling interest rate**
Income statement movement **3** 3

**_(e) Liquidity risk_**

The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the long and short term cash flow
projections for the business against facilities and other resources available to it. Headroom is assessed based on
historical experience as well as by assessing current business risks, including foreign exchange movements.
Existing bank debt facilities do not expire until July 2019, USPP debt matures in three tranches July 2021, 2024
and 2026; it is Group policy to refinance debt maturities significantly ahead of maturity dates.

**_(f) Credit risk_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored. Debt, investments, foreign exchange and derivative
transactions are all spread amongst a number of banks all of which have short or long term credit ratings
appropriate to the Group’s exposures. Trade receivables primarily comprise balances due from Consumer and
TalkTalk Business fixed line customers, and provision is made for any receivables that are considered to be
irrecoverable.

**_(g) Capital risk management_**

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern
while maximising the return to stakeholders.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18, cash and
cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and
retained earnings as disclosed in notes 21 to 22.

The Group’s Board reviews the capital structure on an annual basis. As part of this review, the Board concluded
that it is more appropriate to align its measures with the external metrics in the banking agreement. The Group
uses the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and has a medium term ratio target below 2.0x. The ratio at 31 March 2015
is 2.4x driven primarily by the Company’s continued investment in growth combined with an increased dividend
pay-out. The Board is confident that the ratio will return to its target in the medium term.

### 20. Provisions

**_Accounting policy_**

Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of past events and it is
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is considered to be
material.

Provisions are categorised as follows:

_Operating efficiencies_

Operating efficiencies provisions relate principally to redundancy costs and are only recognised where plans are
demonstrably committed and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the
balance sheet date. These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next twelve months.

_One Company integration_

These provisions relate principally to reorganisation costs and are only recognised where plans are demonstrably
committed and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next twelve months.

_Property_

Property provisions relate to dilapidations and similar property costs, and costs associated with onerous property
contracts. All such provisions are assessed by reference to the terms and conditions of the contract and market
conditions at the balance sheet date. Onerous property contracts are expected to be utilised over the next seven
years. Dilapidation provisions are expected to be utilised as and when properties are exited.

_Contract and other_

Contract and other provisions relate mainly to customer migration costs as a result of the customer base
acquisitions in the current year and the SIM replacement costs as part of the mobile migration programme (note
9). The remaining are provisions on onerous contracts and contracts with unfavourable terms arising on the
acquisition of businesses and anticipated costs of unresolved legal disputes. All such provisions are assessed by
reference to the best available information at the balance sheet date.

- On 16 September 2013, the Group’s Remuneration Committee determined that the relevant performance conditions of the VES
schemes had been satisfied, meaning the VES participants were entitled to exercise the remaining 40% of their options as set out in note
5. The settlement of the schemes resulted in the recognition of share premium of £66m and a £78m movement in retained earnings and
other reserves.
** On 14 May 2013, the Group acquired the remaining 75% of the issued share capital of FOC. The Group already held 25% of FOC and
had control of the business. The cash consideration paid for the acquisition of £3m has been recognised as a transaction with a
non-controlling interest.

**_Group ESOT_**

The Group ESOT held 33 million shares at 31 March 2015 (2014: 34 million) in the Company for the benefit of
employees. The Group ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends and none of its shares have been
allocated to specific schemes. At the year end the shares had a market value of £112m (2014: £109m).

**_Demerger reserve_**

The demerger reserve primarily reflects the profits or losses arising on the transfer of investments and net assets
of CPW on demerger.

**_Translation reserve_**

The results of overseas operations are translated at the average foreign exchange rates for the year, and their
balance sheets are translated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the
translation of opening net assets and results of overseas operations are recognised in the translation and hedging
reserve. All other exchange differences are included in the income statement.

The Group leases network infrastructure and offices under non-cancellable operating leases. The leases have
varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights. There were no leases which were
individually significant to the Group.

### 26. Related party transactions

**_a) Subsidiaries and joint ventures_**

Details of subsidiaries and joint ventures are disclosed in notes 13 and 14 respectively.

**_b) Directors_**

The remuneration of the Directors, who are some of the key management personnel of the Group, is set out in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 29 to 46. The remuneration of all key management personnel is
disclosed in note 4.

### 27. Contingent liabilities

As at 31 March 2014, the Group had received £33m in total in relation to an Ofcom determination that BT had
overcharged for certain wholesale Ethernet services. During the year ended 31 March 2015, BT lost its appeal
against Ofcom’s determination in the Competition Appeal Tribunal and appealed to the Court of Appeal. The
decision of that appeal has not yet been made and the Group considers the appeal is unlikely to succeed based on
the advice received and so no liability for repayment has been recorded at the year end, although the outcome of
the appeal is not yet certain.

### 28. Events after the balance sheet date

On 22 April 2015, the Group acquired 100% shares of tIPicall limited, a company providing Voice over Internet
Protocol (VoIP) services for cash of £5m plus an element of deferred consideration depending on the
performance of the business. The Group’s investment in the company will be accounted for as a subsidiary in
accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combination’. The financial impact of the acquisition on the Group position is
not material.

### Independent auditor’s report to the members of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC

**Opinion on financial statements of TalkTalk Telecom Group plc**

In our opinion:

 - the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s
affairs as at 31 March 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended;

- the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;

- the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and

- the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.

The financial statements comprise the Group income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive income,
the Group statement of changes in equity, the Group and Parent Company balance sheets, the Group cash flow
statement, the Parent Company reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and the related notes 1 to 28.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is
applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been
applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).

**Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the IASB**

As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, in addition to complying with its legal obligation to
apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the Group has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International
Accounting Standards Board (IASB).

In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued by the IASB.

**Going concern**

As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement contained within the Chief Financial
Officer’s Statement that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:

- we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the
financial statements is appropriate; and

 - we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern.

However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

**Our assessment of risks of material misstatement**

The assessed risks of material misstatement described opposite are those that had the greatest effect on our audit
strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

**Risk** **How the scope of our audit responded to the risk**


**Revenue recognition**
Revenue recognition surrounding:

- the completeness over revenue due to the high
volume of low value data. The majority of the
Group’s revenue is generated from the output of
billing systems; and


We tested the operating effectiveness of key IT and
business controls over the customer billing systems.
Our tests assessed the operating effectiveness of
controls put in place to ensure all services supplied to
customers are input into and processed through the
billing systems.

- the accuracy and completeness of revenue recognised
on transactions which are outside the normal billing
process, which by their nature carry a higher level of
management judgement.

**Disclosure of exceptional items and the presentation**
**of adjusted measures in the financial statements**
The disclosure of exceptional items and their
presentation on the face of the income statement
represents an audit risk given the level of management
judgement involved. Areas of particular audit focus in
the current year are exceptional costs recognised in
relation to dual running costs, internal labour costs and
the “Red Routers” programme – all of which we deem
to carry a higher level of judgement. The nature of these
costs have been defined in note 9 to the accounts.

**Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets**
Management is required to undertake an annual
impairment review, which incorporates judgements
based on assumptions of future cash flows, including
assumptions around revenue growth, margins and
forecast cash flows, the selection of appropriate discount
rates and the assessment of the Group’s cash generating
units.

F-122


This enabled us to obtain controls assurance over
billing systems accounting for over 95% of total
Group revenue. We subsequently applied a
combination of substantive analytical review
procedures and tests of detail to obtain assurance
over the validity and completeness of the reported
output of these systems.

We performed substantive testing on a sample of
non-systematic adjustments which are outside of the
normal billing process and therefore carry higher
levels of management judgement. These included
revenue deferrals and the write back of historical
credits applied to customer accounts to the income
statement.

In addition to understanding the composition of
exceptional items and agreeing a sample of items to
supporting documentation, we have challenged
management’s rationale for the presentation of items
within the income statement as exceptional,
particularly around the areas of higher judgement,
such as dual-running, to ensure the costs recognised
as exceptional meet the criteria of the accounting
policy for such items defined by the Group within
note 9. This includes assessing the incremental nature
of the costs, the extent to which the costs are
non-recurring, whether they are specific to individual
projects and considering whether they should be
classified as part of underlying operations.

Our work has also included a review, on a sample
basis, of items included within the income statement
to identify income and expenses which were
exceptional by nature but not separately identified.

We challenged management’s assumptions used in
the impairment model for goodwill and intangible
assets, including specifically the determination of
cash generating units, the forecast cash flow
projections for each cash generating unit and the
discount rates. In making this critical assessment of
the cash flow projections we assessed historical
forecasting accuracy and compared forecast profit
margins to historical margins and benchmarked the
discount rate and growth rates employed to available
market data. We critically assessed management’s
position as to whether or not a reasonably possible
change to key operating assumptions could result in
an impairment. In doing so we considered the
sensitivity of the asset valuations to these
assumptions, in particular changes to the long term
growth rate assumed and the growth of the TV and
Fibre customer bases. We also considered the
appropriateness of the related disclosures set out in
note 11 to the accounts.


-----

**Treatment and presentation of deferred tax assets**
The accounting treatment and presentation of the
measurement of deferred tax assets relating to losses of
Video Networks Limited acquired with Tiscali which
have been disclosed within note 7. The recognition of
these deferred tax assets are judgemental as a result of
their nature and reliance on management forecasts.


We have reviewed correspondence with HMRC
supporting the availability of these losses and have
challenged management’s forecasts of future taxable
profits to determine the appropriate quantum of
Video Network losses to recognise as a deferred tax
asset.


The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 23.

Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial
statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the
financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not express an
opinion on these individual matters.

**Our application of materiality**

We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality
both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.

We determined planning materiality for the Group to be £6m (2013: £8.2m). In determining materiality, we made
allowance for the impact of the subscriber acquisition costs related to TV customers which has reduced current
year profits. Our materiality was therefore set by blending revenue and profit metrics to take this matter in to
account. On the basis of our risk assessment, together with our assessment of the Group’s overall control
environment, our judgement is that performance materiality for the Group should be 70% of planning materiality,
namely £4.2m. Our objective in adopting this approach is to ensure that total detected and undetected audit
differences do not exceed our planning materiality for the financial statements as whole.

We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of
£120,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative
grounds.

We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall
presentation of the financial statements.

**An overview of the scope of our audit**

Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Groupwide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we
focused our Group audit scope primarily on the TalkTalk Consumer and TalkTalk Business operating units, each
of these was subject to a full audit and represent 95% of the Group’s total assets and revenues. Specific focused
audit work was performed over Group functions, including those covering treasury and taxation. Our audit work
at each division was executed at levels of materiality which were lower than Group materiality.

At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to
confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial
information of the remaining components not subject to audit.

**Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006**

In our opinion:

- the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 2006; and

 - the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

F-123


-----

**Matters on which we are required to report by exception**

**_Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records_**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:

- we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or

- adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or

- the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.

We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.

**_Directors’ remuneration_**

Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’
remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in
agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.

**_Corporate Governance Statement_**

Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating
to the Company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to
report arising from our review.

**_Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report_**

Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion,
information in the Annual Report is:

 - materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or

- apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired
in the course of performing our audit; or

- otherwise misleading.

In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and
understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to
the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any
such inconsistencies or misleading statements.

**Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor**

As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law
and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on
Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control
procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated
professional standards review team, strategically focused second partner reviews and independent partner
reviews.

This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

F-124

**Scope of the audit of the financial statements**

An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and
the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the
course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we
consider the implications for our report.

### Notes to the consolidated financial statements

 1. Accounting policies and basis of preparation

**_Basis of preparation_**

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006.

The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union (EU) and as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. These financial statements therefore comply with
Article 4 of the European Union International Accounting Standard regulation. The Company has elected to
prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.

The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain
financial instruments and investments. The financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest
million, because that is the currency of the principal economic environment in which the Group operates.

**_Basis of consolidation_**

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by
the Company (its subsidiaries) and entities which are joint ventures accounted for using the equity method made
up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.

The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included from or to the date on which control
passed to or was relinquished by the Group. Intercompany transactions and balances between subsidiaries are
eliminated on consolidation.

Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries and the results of joint
ventures to bring accounting policies in line with those used by the Group.

**_Going concern_**

The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Details of the considerations undertaken
by the Directors in reaching this conclusion are set out on page 14 within the Chief Financial Officer’s statement.

**_Accounting policies_**

The Group’s principal accounting policies, which relate to the financial statements as a whole, are set out below.
Where an accounting policy is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates. This
section also shows new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments and interpretations, whether these are
effective in the current or later years. In both cases it is explained how they are expected to impact the
performance of the Group.

**_Revenue_**

Revenue is stated net of VAT and other sales related taxes and represents the gross inflow of economic benefit
generated from the provision of fixed line, TV and mobile telecommunications services. All such revenue is
recognised as the services are provided:

 - line rental is recognised in the period to which it relates;

- voice and broadband subscriptions are recognised in the period to which they relate;

- usage including voice and TV content is recognised in the period in which the customer takes the service;

- promotional discounts are amortised on a straight line basis over the minimum contract period subject to an
adjustment for in-contract churn; and

 - data service solutions and other service contracts are recognised as the Group fulfils its performance
obligations.

F-131


-----

Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. When the Group sells a number of
products within a bundled transaction, the total consideration from the arrangement is allocated to each element
based on their relative fair values. The amount of revenue the Group recognises for delivered elements is limited
to the cash received.

**_Subscriber acquisition costs_**

Subscriber acquisition costs include both third party costs of recruiting and retaining new customers as well as
device costs. These are expensed as incurred.

**_Foreign currency translation and transactions_**

Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases or sales of the relevant currencies
and are recognised in the financial statements at the exchange rates thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are
recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ has been applied in the current and preceding financial year by
marking to market the relevant financial instruments at the balance sheet date and recognising the gain or loss
through other comprehensive income in respect of cash flow hedges.

The principal exchange rates against UK Sterling used in these financial statements are as follows:

**Average** **Closing**
**2014** **2013** **2014** **2013**

Euro **1.19** 1.23 **1.21** 1.19
United States Dollar **1.60** 1.58 **1.67** 1.52

Where a foreign operation is sold, the gain or loss on disposal recognised in the income statement is determined
after taking into account the cumulative currency translation differences that are attributable to the operation.

**_Leases_**

Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the
period of the lease. Lease incentives and rent free periods are amortised through the income statement over the
period of the lease.

Gains or losses from sale and leaseback transactions are deferred over the life of the new lease to the extent that
the rentals are considered to be above or below market rentals. The remaining gain or loss is recognised within
operating expenses in the year in which the sale is completed.

**_Financial instruments_**

Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised in the Group’s balance
sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.

_Trade and other receivables_

Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an
active market are classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using
the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective
interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.

_Cash and cash equivalents_

Cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits consists of cash in hand.

_Trade payables_

Trade payables are other financial liabilities initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at
amortised cost.

_Financial liabilities and equity instruments_

Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the
contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An

F-132


-----

equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of
its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies adopted
for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.

_Loans and other borrowings_

Loans and other borrowings represent committed and uncommitted bank loans, bank overdrafts and loans from
related parties. These are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception) and are
subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.

Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of external financing are capitalised and amortised over
the term of the relevant facility. All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in
which they are incurred.

Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are
included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.

_Equity instruments_

Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issuance costs.

Shares in the Company held by the Group ESOT are shown as a reduction in shareholders’ funds. Other assets
and liabilities held by the trust are consolidated with the assets of the Group.

_Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting_

The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The
use of financial derivatives is governed by the framework approved by the Board, which provides written
principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. Changes in
values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs in the
income statement. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.

Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently
remeasured to fair value at each reporting date.

Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no
longer qualifies for hedge accounting, or the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.

_Cash flow hedges_

The Group uses derivative instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to manage its interest rate risk. The Group
designates these as cash flow hedges. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these instruments is
recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised
immediately in the income statement.

_Measurement_

The financial instruments included on the Group’s balance sheet are measured at fair value or amortised cost.
The measurement of this fair value can in some cases be subjective and can depend on the inputs used in the
calculations. The different valuation methods are called ‘hierarchies’ and are described below:

 - Level 1: Fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities;

- Level 2: Fair values measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are
observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly; and

 - Level 3: Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market
data.

**_Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty_**

The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s
accounting policies. Estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are continually
reviewed and revised as necessary. Whilst every effort is made to ensure that such estimates and assumptions are
reasonable, by their nature they are uncertain, and as such changes in estimates and assumptions may have a
material impact.

The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements
are set out in more detail in the related notes:

 - tax (note 7);

- exceptional items (note 9);

- impairment of goodwill (note 11);

 - capitalisation and useful economic lives of assets (notes 11 and 12);

- impairment of assets (notes 11 and 12); and

 - trade receivables (note 16).

**_Application of significant new or amended EU endorsed accounting standards_**

Amendments to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements: Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive
Income’ and IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’ became effective in the current reporting period. These new and
revised standards and interpretations have no material impact on the Group.

In addition, the Group has elected to early adopt IAS 36 (revised) ‘Impairment of Assets’ (IAS 36), which is
endorsed by the EU, but not effective until periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014. The amendments to
IAS 36 enhance the disclosure requirements arising when recoverable amounts have been determined on the
basis of fair value less costs of disposal. They also limit the requirement to disclose the recoverable amount of an
asset or CGU to periods in which an impairment loss has been recognised or reverses.

We have chosen to adopt the amendments early, as allowed by the standard, with effect from 1 April 2013.

**_Future accounting developments_**

At the date of authorisation of these financial statements the following significant standards and interpretations
that have not been applied in these financial statements were in issue, but not yet effective (and in some cases
had not yet been adopted by the EU):

- IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’

- IFRS 10, IFRS 12 and
IAS 27 (amended) ‘Investment Entities’

- IAS 32 (amended) ‘Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’

- IAS 39 (amended) ‘Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting’

- IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’

The Directors do not expect that the adoption of these standards will have a material impact on the financial
statements of the Group in future periods, except as follows:

- IFRS 9 will impact the:

  - measurement and disclosure of financial instruments; and

  - disclosure of interest the Group has in other entities.

Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these
standards until a detailed review has been completed.

### 2. Segmental reporting

**_Accounting policy_**

IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires the segmental information presented in the financial statements to be that
used by the chief operating decision maker to evaluate the performance of the business and decide how to
allocate resources. The Group has identified the Board as its chief operating decision maker. The Board considers
the results of the business as a whole when assessing the performance of the business and making decisions about
the allocation of resources. Accordingly the Group has one operating segment.

**2014** **2013**
**£m** **£m**

Headline revenue **1,727** 1,670

Headline EBITDA **213** 290

Operating profit **51** 141

The Group’s revenue is split by On-net, Off-net and Corporate products as this information is provided to the
Group’s chief operating decision maker. On-net and Off-net comprise Consumer and Business customers that
receive similar services.

The Group has no material overseas operations; as a result a split of revenue and total assets by geographical
location has not been disclosed.

### 3. Operating profit before interest and taxation

Group profit before interest and taxation is stated after charging (crediting):

### 4. Employee costs

The average number of employees (including Executive Directors) was:

**2014** **2013**
**Number** **Number**

Administration **1,516** 1,517
Sales and customer management **792** 998

**2,308** 2,515

The aggregate remuneration recognised in respect of these employees in the income statement comprised:

**2014** **2013**
**£m** **£m**

Wages and salaries **104** 110
Social security costs **13** 14
Other pension costs **4** 3

**121** 127
Share-based payments (note 5) **4** 6

**125** 133

The Group provides various defined contribution pension schemes for the benefit of a significant number of its
employees. These are charged to the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of
the schemes.

Compensation earned by key management personnel is analysed below. The key management personnel
comprised the TalkTalk Group Executive Board and Board of Directors.


**2014**

Salaries and fees **3.9** 4.0
Performance bonuses **1.8** 1.9
Benefits **0.2** 0.1
Pension costs **0.2** 0.2
Share-based payments* **0.7** 0.9

**6.8** 7.1

- The prior year share-based payments charge has been restated from £2.2m to £0.9m. This is to reflect the fact that the charge disclosed
in the 2013 Annual Report showed the total charge across the life of the scheme for these employees rather than just the FY13 charge.

### 5. Share-based payments

**_Accounting policy_**

The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments
are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the
number of shares that will eventually vest.

Fair value is measured by use of a dividend discount or Binomial model for share-based payments with internal,
non-market performance criteria (for example, EPS targets) and a Black Scholes or Monte Carlo model for those
with external, ‘market’ performance criteria (for example, TSR targets).

For schemes with non-market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is recalculated at each
balance sheet date, based on expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting. The
movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement,
with a corresponding entry in reserves.

F-136


-----

For schemes with market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is adjusted only for
expectations of leavers prior to vesting. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet
date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.

If a scheme is cancelled, any remaining part of the fair value of the scheme is expensed immediately. If a scheme
is forfeited, no further expense is recognised and any charges previously recognised are reversed.

Charges arise on loans that are provided to employees to fund the purchase of shares in the Group as part of long
term incentive plans. To the extent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable, the cost of
such loans is expensed over the course of the relevant incentive plans. Charges are also recognised on loans
provided to employees to settle personal tax liabilities; to the extent to which the loans are not, in certain
circumstances, repayable, the cost of such loans is expensed on grant.

In accordance with IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’ no cost has been recognised in respect of the options granted
before November 2002.

**_Group share schemes_**

The Group’s share schemes are the Discretionary Share Option Plan (DSOP) and Save-As-You-Earn scheme
(SAYE).

In addition, the Group has a number of legacy CPW schemes.

In order to aid the user of the accounts, the dilutive effect on EPS of each of the Group schemes and legacy CPW
schemes has been presented. This has been calculated using an average share price for the financial year of £2.67
(2013: £1.98).

For the CPW legacy schemes, there is no IFRS 2 charge in the current year (2013: £1m). the disclosures are
limited to the dilutive effect on EPS and the number of options outstanding at the end of the year.

In September 2013, the remaining 40% of the TTG VES and the CPW TTG VES vested. Further information is
set out in section (vi) of this note.

_(i) All Employee Share Option Award—2012_

The All Employee Share Option Award—2012 was granted in September 2012, under the DSOP rules, approved
by shareholders in 2010. The award of 1,000 nil priced share options per qualifying employee was designed to
reward all employees who were not part of another share option plan and to foster all-employee share ownership.
The exercise of options was subject to continuing employment at the vesting date in September 2013 and there
are no performance conditions in relation to this award. These options lapse on resignation of an employee. On
12 September 2013, two million options vested and were exercised by qualifying employees.

_(ii) DSOP—2013 grant_

In June 2013, the Group granted six million nil priced share option awards subject to absolute TSR and EPS
performance targets. During December 2013 and January 2014, the Group granted a further 141,000 options
under the DSOP—2013 grant to a number of new senior employees. The options are measured over a
performance period to 31 March 2016 and will vest on the publication of the Group’s 2016 Annual Report. A
total of 60% of the vested options are exercisable from the vesting date, with the remaining 40% of options being
exercisable twelve months later. Options are forfeited if an employee leaves the Group before the options vest.
Awards are triggered within a range from 5% to 26% for compound annual growth of TSR and EPS. If the
minimum performance requirement is met a total of 25% of the award will vest, rising to 40% for target, 70% for
stretch and 100% for super stretch.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of the DSOP—2013 grant is 9.2 years. The TalkTalk DSOP is
designed to provide a long term incentive plan for senior employees of the Group.

_(iii) DSOP—2012 grant_

Nil priced share option awards made under the DSOP 2012 grant are subject to absolute TSR and EPS
performance targets with a cap and collar to address volatility in the market, as detailed in the Directors’
Remuneration Report. The options are measured over a performance period to 31 March 2015 and will vest on
the publication of the Group’s 2015 Annual Report. A total of 60% of the vested options are exercisable from the
vesting date, with the remaining 40% of options being exercisable twelve months later. Options are forfeited if an
employee leaves the Group before the options vest. Awards are triggered within a range from 10% to 19% for
compound annual growth of TSR and EPS. If the minimum performance requirement is met a total of 25% of the
award will vest, rising to 40% for target, 70% for stretch and 100% for super stretch.

_(iv) DSOP—2010 grant_

Awards made under the DSOP—2010 grant are subject to TSR performance targets and were measured over a
performance period to 28 March 2013. Options were forfeited if an employee left the Group before the options
vested. On 28 March 2013, all options vested but they were not exercisable until after the preliminary
announcement on 16 May 2013. The original date of vesting of 29 March 2013 was brought forward to 28 March
2013 due to a bank holiday. During the year ended 31 March 2014, 15 million options were exercised.

236,000 vested on 1 September 2013. All 472,000 of these options were exercised in the year ended 31 March
2014.

_(v) SAYE_

The scheme permits the granting of options to employees linked to a bank SAYE contract for a term of three or
five years. Contributions from UK employees range from £5 to £250. Options may be exercised at the end of the
three or five year period at an exercise price determined at the invitation date. The scheme is available for a
period each year for employees to join.

_(vi) TTG VES and CPW TTG VES_

The TTG VES enables participants to share in up to 7% of any increase in the value of the Group over an
opening valuation representing invested capital at 1 April 2009, adjusted as relevant for changes in invested
capital since that date. The incremental value is measured after a minimum annual rate of return of 7% on this
invested capital. The Group advanced loans to participants to enable them to purchase A shares in TalkTalk
Group Limited, the holding company of the Group’s operating business. The CPW TTG VES enables
participants to share in 2.24% of any increase in the value of the Group over an opening valuation representing
invested capital at 1 April 2009, adjusted for the change in the Group’s opening share price since 1 April 2009. In
line with the TTG VES, the invested capital is adjusted for changes in invested capital since 1 April 2009 and the
incremental value is measured after a minimum annual rate of return of 7%. For the vesting in September 2013,
this is capped at the September 2012 amount. The rules of both schemes have been approved by shareholders.

The Group’s opening share price for this purpose represents an allocation of the share price of CPW at that rate,
based on the market capitalisation of the Group and Carphone Warehouse Group PLC in the five days following
demerger. CPW advanced loans to participants to enable them to purchase C shares in TalkTalk Group Limited,
the holding company of the Group’s operating businesses. The Group has an obligation to acquire the A and C
shares if performance conditions are met, to provide to participants the share of value described above.

The fair value of the schemes, which has performance targets based on the growth of the market capitalisation of
the Group, was estimated at the date of grant using a Monte Carlo model to initially value the A shares and then a
Black Scholes model to calculate the option value. The model combines the valuation price of a share at the date
of grant with the probability of meeting performance criteria, based on the expected value of the Group at the
date of grant discounted for the lack of marketability of the shares.

On 16 September 2013, the Group’s Remuneration Committee determined that the relevant performance
conditions of these VES schemes (including the 5% TSR requirement) had been satisfied meaning the VES
participants were entitled to exercise the remaining 40% of their VES options. On 19 November 2013, the
participants’ options were acquired by the Company for new ordinary shares in the Company and cash, resulting
in a cash outflow of £15m. The net issue of 23.7 million shares in the Company was at a price of £2.78 per share,

F-140


-----

being the average closing price of the Company’s shares over the five working days from 12 to 18 November
2013. The settlement of the schemes resulted in a net movement in reserves of £12m being the recognition of
share premium of £66m and a £78m debit in retained earnings and other reserves. The £78m debit to reserves
represents a total cash outflow of £15m and the value of new PLC shares issued of £66m net of the repayment of
the associated VES loans, interest and a reduction in the Group’s liability to settle the schemes.

### 6. Finance costs and investment revenue

Finance costs are analysed as follows:

During the year ended 31 March 2012, the Group refinanced its revolving credit facility and paid £7m in respect
of facility fees. This is being amortised over the expected life of the loan and is included within facility fees and
similar charges above.

### 7. Taxation

**_Accounting policy_**

Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or
recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the
balance sheet and its tax base.

Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences.
Deferred tax assets represent tax recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, and
the carry-forward of unused tax losses and credits. Deferred tax is determined using the tax rates that have been
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the deferred tax asset is
realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.

A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available
against which the asset can be utilised. Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except
where it relates to an item recognised directly in reserves, in which case it is recognised directly in reserves.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.

**_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_**

The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to which taxable profits are generated in the
relevant jurisdictions for the foreseeable future, and on the tax legislation then in force, and as such the value of
associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.

No deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in either year, except where there is a legal right to do so in
the relevant jurisdictions. On 2 July 2013, a reduction in the UK statutory rate of corporation tax was
substantively enacted, bringing the tax rate down from 23% to 21% with effect from 1 April 2014 and from 21%
to 20% with effect from 1 April 2015. Accordingly, the tax assets and liabilities recognised at 31 March 2014
take account of these changes. This has resulted in a tax charge to the income statement as the value of the
Group’s tax assets has been reduced.

The asset also reflects the annual recognition of a further tranche of the tax losses acquired with Tiscali UK
Limited, including Video Networks Limited, based on the Group’s rolling forecast. This is in line with the
Group’s agreement with HMRC in 2012.

At 31 March 2014, the Group had unused tax losses of £702m (2013: £759m) available for offset against future
taxable profits. A deferred tax asset of £39m (2013: £40m) has been recognised in respect of £197m (2013:
£172m) of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the foreseeable future.

No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £505m (2013: £587m) as there is
insufficient evidence that there will be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered. All
losses may be carried forward indefinitely.

### 8. Dividends

**_Accounting policy_**

Dividend income is recognised when payment has been received. Final dividend distributions are recognised as a
liability in the financial statements in the year in which they are approved by the relevant shareholders. Interim
dividends are recognised in the year in which they are paid.

F-143


-----

The following dividends were paid by the Group to its shareholders:

**2014** **2013**
**£m** **£m**

**Ordinary dividends**
Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2012 of 6.40p per ordinary share **—** 56
Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2013 of 3.45p per ordinary share **—** 31
Final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2013 of 6.95p per ordinary share **62** —
Interim dividend for the year ended 31 March 2014 of 4.00p per ordinary share **37** —

**Total ordinary dividends** **99** 87

The proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2014 of 8.00p per ordinary share on approximately
921 million ordinary shares (£74m) was approved by the Board on 14 May 2014 and has not been included as a
liability as at 31 March 2014.

The Group ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends in the current and prior year and this is reflected in
the analysis above.

### 9. Reconciliation of Headline information to Statutory information

**_Accounting policy_**

Headline results are stated before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items. Exceptional
items are those that are considered to be one-off, non-recurring in nature and so material that the Directors
believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid distortion of underlying performance and should be
separately presented on the face of the income statement.

**_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_**

The classification of items as exceptional is subjective in nature and therefore, judgement is required to
determine whether the item is in line with the accounting policy criteria outlined above. Determining whether an
item is exceptional is a matter of qualitative assessment, making it distinct from the Group’s other critical
accounting judgements where the basis for judgement surrounds estimation.

_a) Operating efficiencies—Phase III (Making TalkTalk Simpler)_

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group has continued a review of its operating structure to look for
further opportunities to drive process and efficiency improvements over the medium term.

The initiatives that form part of the Group’s Making TalkTalk Simpler programme, which were implemented in
the year ended 31 March 2014, were continued restructuring of the systems and processes in TalkTalk Business
to remove duplication and better align the sales and service model for future growth; a review and consolidation
of the outsourcing partners and rebalancing of the Group’s on-shore footprint; and a proactive initiative to
replace routers to align the estate across the Group. This has resulted in redundancy, dual running, property,
system, project management and router replacement costs. The total charge incurred in the year ended 31 March
2014 was £20m (2013: £7m).

A total taxation credit of £5m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2014 (2013: £2m).

_b) Operating efficiencies—Phase II (Consumer contact centre rationalisation)_

On 24 April 2012, the Group announced the second stage of its contact centre rationalisation. This resulted in
consolidating and outsourcing operations in Preston and Northampton. Costs were incurred in respect of
redundancy, dual running and consultancy. The total charge incurred in the year ended 31 March 2014 was £nil
(2013: £11m).

A total taxation credit of £nil has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2014 (2013: £3m).

_c) Wholesale Ethernet services overcharges_

In December 2012, Ofcom determined that BT had overcharged the Group for certain wholesale Ethernet
services. Accordingly, BT was required to make repayments to the Group for these overcharges. A total of £3m
has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2014 (2013: £27m).

A total taxation charge of £1m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2014 (2013: £6m).

_d) Revenue—HMRC VAT ruling_

In September 2013, a change to a previously agreed VAT treatment in relation to prompt payment discounts was
enforced by HMRC with immediate effect. The incremental VAT relating to this change in treatment has been
paid by the Group; however, the Group has sought external legal advice on the HMRC decision and has
subsequently appealed the decision to the VAT Tribunal. Due to both the unexpected nature, pending appeal and
short timeframe given to comply, a total of £5m has been recognised in exceptional items in the year ended
31 March 2014 (2013: £nil).

The tax credit was £1m in the year ended 31 March 2014 (2013: £nil).

_e) Amortisation of acquisition intangibles_

An amortisation charge in respect of acquisition intangibles of £21m was incurred in the year ended 31 March
2014 (2013: £52m).

The tax credit was £5m in the year ended 31 March 2014 (2013: £12m).

### 11. Goodwill and other intangible assets

**_(a) Goodwill_**

_Accounting policy_

Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing the excess of the fair
value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is recognised
initially as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.

On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss
on disposal.

_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_

The Group has two CGUs—Consumer and TalkTalk Business. For the purpose of impairment testing, at the
acquisition date, goodwill is allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the
acquisition. The Group’s shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are
allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows that those shared costs support.

Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the
goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the
CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates, to use to calculate present values.

_Impairment of goodwill_

Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication
that the asset may be impaired; this review is performed at a CGU level.

F-146


-----

Impairment is determined by assessing the future cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill relates. The
future cash flows of the Group are taken from the Board approved five year plan and extrapolated out to 20 years
based on the UK’s long term growth rate. This is discounted by the CGU’s weighted average cost of capital
pre-tax to give the net present value of that CGU. Where the net present value of future cash flows is less than the
carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill
allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each
asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is recognised in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed.

Sensitivity analysis is performed using reasonably possible changes in the key assumptions.

**£m** **£m**

Opening cost and net book value **479** 480
Disposal (note 13) **—** (1)

Closing cost and net book value **479** 479

The goodwill acquired in business combinations is allocated at acquisition to the CGUs that are expected to
benefit from that business combination. The allocation of goodwill across the CGUs is as follows:

**2014** **2013**
**£m** **£m**

Consumer **337** 337
TalkTalk Business **142** 142

**479** 479

_Impairment review_

The key assumptions used in the Group’s goodwill impairment review are as follows:

- Long term growth rates

Long term revenue growth rates applied are based on the growth rate for the UK per the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The rate applied in the current year was 1.7% (2013: 1.1%).

- Discount rate

The underlying discount rate for each CGU is based on the UK ten year gilt rate adjusted for an equity risk
premium and the systematic risk of the CGU. The average pre-tax rate for both CGUs used to discount the
forecast cash flows is 8.4% (2013: 8.1%). The assumptions used in the calculation of the CGUs’ discount rate are
benchmarked to externally available data. The same discount rate has been applied to both CGUs due to the
similarity of risk factors and geographical location.

- Capital expenditure

Forecast capital expenditure is based on senior management expectations of future required support of the
network and current run rate of expenditure.

- Customer factors

The key assumptions for the forecast cash flows of each of the CGUs are based on expected customer growth
rates, ARPU, direct costs, including acquisition costs and change in product mix. The value assigned to each of
these assumptions has been determined based on the extrapolation of historical trends in the Group and external
information on expected trends of future market developments.

Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and the Directors have not identified any
reasonably possible material changes in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to
exceed the recoverable amount.

**_(b) Other intangible assets_**

_Accounting policy_

**Operating intangibles**

Operating intangibles include internal infrastructure and design costs incurred in the development of software for
internal use. Internally generated software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately
identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, and the development cost can be
measured reliably. Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in
the year in which it is incurred. Operating intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated
useful economic lives of up to eight years.

**Acquisition intangibles**

Acquired intangible assets such as customer bases and other intangible assets acquired through a business
combination are capitalised separately from goodwill and amortised over their expected useful lives of up to
six years on a straight line basis. The value attributed to such assets is based on the future economic benefit that
is expected to be derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash flows after a deduction for
contributory assets.

_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_

**Impairment**

At the acquisition date, acquisition intangibles are allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the
synergies of the combination. The Group’s shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central
overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows.

Determining whether the carrying amount of operating and acquisition intangibles have any indication of
impairment requires judgement. If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to
assess whether the carrying amount can be supported by the value in use of the CGU that the asset is allocated to.

The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of
appropriate discount rates, to use to calculate present values.

**Useful economic lives**

The assessment of the useful economic lives of these operating and acquisition intangibles requires judgement.
Amortisation is charged to the income statement based on the useful economic life selected. This assessment
requires estimation of the period over which the Group will benefit from the assets.

_Impairment of assets_

The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that
those assets have suffered an impairment loss at each reporting date. Where an indicator of impairment exists, the
Group makes a formal estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount and the extent of any impairment loss.

The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing
value in use, the estimated cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that
reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset for which
the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the
asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount.

Accumulated amortisation (133) (299) (432)

**Closing balance at 31 March 2013** 127 27 154

_Operating intangibles_

Operating intangibles includes internally generated assets of net book value £39m (2013: £31m), which are
amortised over a period of up to eight years. This includes additions of £15m (2013: £10m) and an amortisation
charge of £7m (2013: £5m) in the year ended 31 March 2014.

Included within operating intangibles is the following asset, which is material to the Group:

- TRIO, the customer billing system, which has a net book value of £76m (2013: £86m). TRIO is amortised
over a period of up to eight years depending on the release date of the relevant component. The weighted
average remaining useful economic life of the components of TRIO is four years (2013: five years).

_Acquisition intangibles_

Acquisition intangibles are removed from cost in the analysis in the year after they are fully amortised.

All acquisition intangibles relate to customer bases.

The customer bases relate primarily to the Tiscali UK internet access business, which was acquired in July 2009.
The valuation of customer bases is derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from them, after a
deduction for contributory assets.

At 31 March 2014, the Tiscali customer base is material to the Group with a net book value of £5m (2013: £23m)
and a remaining useful economic life of three months (2013: 15 months).

### 12. Property, plant and equipment

**_Accounting policy_**

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment.
Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less
estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected useful life from the date it is
brought into use, as follows:

Short leasehold costs 10% or the lease term if less than ten years
Network equipment and computer hardware 12.5–50% per annum
Fixtures and fittings 20–25% per annum

F-149


-----

**_Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy_**

The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires judgement. Depreciation is charged to the
income statement based on the useful economic life selected. This assessment requires estimation of the period
over which the Group will benefit from the assets.

Determining whether the carrying amount of these assets has any indication of impairment also requires
judgement. If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the
carrying amount can be supported by the value in use of the CGU that the asset is allocated to. The value in use
calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate
discount rates, to calculate present values (note 11).

**_Impairment of assets_**

_Property, plant and equipment_

The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its fixed assets to determine whether there is any indication that
those assets have suffered an impairment loss at each reporting date. The Group uses the same methodology as
set out in note 11 for operating and acquisition intangibles.

### 13. Non-current asset investments

**_Accounting policy_**

Investments, other than subsidiaries, are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration
given plus any transaction costs associated with the acquisition.

Investments are categorised as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value, together
with any related taxation, are taken directly to equity, and recycled to the income statement when the investment
is sold or determined to be impaired.

Non-current asset investments at 31 March 2014 related to a 7.3% (2013: 8.4%) interest in Shared Band Limited,
a telecommunications technology provider. During the prior year the Group impaired its investment to £nil.

_(a) Principal investments_

The Parent Company has investments in the following subsidiary undertakings, which principally affected the
profits or losses or net assets of the Group. To avoid a statement of excessive length, details of investments that
are not significant have been omitted. All holdings are in equity share capital and give the Group an effective
holding of 100% on consolidation.

**Name** **Country of incorporation or registration** **Nature of business**

TalkTalk Group Limited England and Wales Holding company
TalkTalk Telecom Holdings Limited* England and Wales Holding company

_(b) Acquisitions and disposals_

**(i) Acquisitions**

On 14 May 2013, the Group acquired the remaining 75% of the issued share capital of Future Office
Communications Limited (FOC) (note 22).

There were no acquisitions in the prior year.

**(ii) Disposals**

There were no disposals in the year.

In the prior year, the Group disposed of its investment in Southern Communications Networks Limited for cash
consideration of £2m. Associated goodwill of £1m was written off, resulting in a £1m profit on disposal. There
was no associated acquisition intangible in respect of this business.

### 14. Interest in joint venture

**_Accounting policy_**

Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The Group income statement includes the
Group’s share of the post-tax profits or losses of the joint ventures based on their financial statements for the
year.

In the Group balance sheet, the Group’s interest in joint ventures are shown as a non-current asset, representing
the Group’s investment in the share capital of the joint ventures, as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the
Group’s share of the net assets or liabilities less provision for any impairment.

In addition to the carrying amount of the investment, the Group’s interest in joint ventures includes, where
applicable, any long term interests in the venture that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in
the joint venture. An item for which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is,
in substance, an extension of the Group’s interest in that joint venture.

Any loans advanced to a joint venture that, in substance, do not form part of the Group’s net investment are
shown separately in the balance sheet, as a receivable to the Group. Losses recognised using the equity method in
excess of the Group’s investment in ordinary shares are applied to the other components of the Group’s interest
in the joint venture in the reverse order of their seniority (i.e. priority in liquidation).

The Group holds 14.3% of the ordinary share capital of YouView TV Limited, a joint venture with The British
Broadcasting Corporation, ITV Broadcasting Limited, British Telecom PLC, Channel Four Television
Corporation, Arqiva Limited and Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited. The joint venture was set up in order to
develop a free-to-air internet-connected TV service to UK homes. The table below sets out the net additions in
the year.

of YouView TV Limited committing the Group to pay approximately £2m up to 30 June 2014. It is anticipated
that a long term agreement for a further five year term to 31 March 2019 will be signed by 30 June 2014.

During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group, alongside British Sky Broadcasting Limited, British Telecom
PLC and Virgin Media Limited established an equal membership joint venture, Internet Matters Limited. It is a
not-for-profit company, incorporated as a company limited by guarantee. It has been set up as an industry-led
body to promote and educate parents about internet safety for children. The Group is committed to pay £2m over
the period to 31 March 2017.

### 15. Inventories

**_Accounting policy_**

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, valued on a FIFO basis, and consists primarily
of set top boxes, handsets and routers. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less costs expected
to be incurred. A provision is made for obsolete items where appropriate.

-----

Details of the current and non-current borrowing facilities of the Group for the year are set out below.

_Bank overdrafts_

Overdraft facilities are used to assist in short term cash management; these uncommitted facilities bear interest at
a margin over the Bank of England base rate.

_£75m term loan_

The Group has a committed term loan of £75m (2013: £75m), which matures in November 2015. The interest
rate payable in respect of drawings under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR for the relevant currency and for
the appropriate period. The actual margin applicable to any drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA
calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period. Covenants included in this facility restrict the ratio of
net debt to EBITDA and require minimum levels of interest cover and fixed charges (interest and operating lease
expenditure) cover.

_£560m revolving credit facility (RCF) and £30m bilateral agreement_

The Group has a £560m RCF, which matures in November 2015. The interest rate payable in respect of drawings
under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR and for the appropriate period. The actual margin applicable to any
drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.
Covenants included in this facility restrict the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and require minimum levels of
interest cover and fixed charges (interest and operating lease expenditure) cover. In addition to the RCF, the
Group also has £30m of bilateral agreements which mature in March 2015.

The Group’s facilities total £665m. The Group was in compliance with its covenants throughout the current and
prior year.

_Borrowing facilities_

The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at the end of the year, in respect of which all conditions
precedent had been met, as follows:

**2014** **2013**
**Maturity** **£m** **£m**

Undrawn available committed facilities 2015 **175** 265

The book value and fair value of the Group’s loans and other borrowings, all of which are in Sterling, are as
follows:

**2014** **2013**
**£m** **£m**

Less than 1 year **37** 25
1 to 2 years **460** 80
2 to 3 years **—** 295

**497** 400

_Securities and guarantees_

Committed borrowings are guaranteed by Group companies, which make up 75% EBITDA and 75% of gross
assets, excluding internal transactions.

### 19. Financial risk management and derivative financial instruments

The book value and fair value of the Group’s financial assets, liabilities and derivative financial instruments,
excluding the Group’s loans and other borrowings shown in note 18, are as follows:

**2014** **2013**
**£m** **£m**

**Current assets**
Cash and cash equivalents **—** 7
Trade and other receivables **260** 226
**Non-current assets**
Non-current investments and investment in joint venture **7** 9
**Current liabilities**
Bank overdrafts **(7)** —
Trade and other payables* **(456)** (428)
Derivative financial instruments** **—** (3)

**(196)** (189)

- Deferred income has been included within the financial liabilities above so as to give completeness over the Group’s contractual
commitments on future cash outflows.
** Derivative financial instruments are included with other payables in note 17.

**_(a) Financial instruments_**

The Group’s activities exposed it to a variety of financial risks including market risk (such as currency risk and
interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group Treasury function used certain financial instruments to
mitigate potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance from these risks. These financial
instruments primarily consisted of bank loans and interest rate swaps. Other products, such as currency options,
can also be used depending on the risks to be covered, but have not been used in the current or preceding
financial year. The Group does not trade or speculate in any financial instruments.

The Group has cash flow hedges in place that swap the interest rate risk on the revolving credit facility (RCF)
from floating to fixed. These hedges have been fully effective from inception. The fair value measurement is
classified as Level 2, derived from other observable market data; this means that their fair value is based upon the
mark to market valuation at the balance sheet date. Fair value measurement at Level 2 gives consideration to
interest rates, yield curves and foreign exchange rates at commonly quoted intervals for relevant currencies. The
Group has also assessed the credit risk within its financial instruments. The fair value of these instruments at
31 March 2014 is £nil (2013: £3m). A gain of £3m (2013: loss of £2m) has been recognised in other
comprehensive income in the year ended 31 March 2014. As the hedges were fully effective there has been no
income statement impact.

**_(b) Embedded derivatives_**

No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and accordingly no such derivatives have been
accounted for separately.

**_(c) Foreign exchange risk_**

The Group uses spot and forward foreign exchange trading to hedge transactional exposures, which arise mainly
through cost of sales and operating expenses, and are primarily denominated in Euro and US Dollar. At 31 March
2014, the fair value of outstanding currency contracts was £7m (2013: £17m).

F-156


-----

Borrowings and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates; this sensitivity
can be analysed in comparison to year end rates (adjusted for funding to related parties and assuming all other
variables remain constant). There was no material impact of a 10% movement in the UK Sterling/Euro exchange
rate on either the income statement or other equity. The effect of foreign exchange derivatives on borrowings at
the year end was as follows:

**UK Sterling** **Euro** **Other** **Total**
**£m** **£m** **£m** **£m**

**2014**
Borrowings before derivatives **497** **—** **—** **497**

**490** **10** **(3)** **497**

**2013**
Borrowings before derivatives 400 — — 400
Derivatives (17) 19 (2) —

383 19 (2) 400

During the year, the Group used derivatives for management of foreign currency cash balances held by overseas
subsidiaries, which were inherited from CPW on demerger and foreign currency trading balances.

**_(d) Interest rate risk_**

The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at
floating rates of interest and thus expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. These floating rates are linked
to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument and currency. Future cash flows arising
from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods for each loan or rollover. As detailed in
section (a), the Group has cash flow hedges in place to mitigate its interest rate risk on its borrowings.

Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and
such movements have been analysed in the table below by calculating the effect on the income statement and
equity of one percentage point movement in the interest rate for the currencies in which most Group cash and
borrowings are denominated. Funding to related parties has been offset against gross borrowings in calculating
these sensitivities. This annualised analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the year end positions
prevail throughout the year, and therefore may not be representative of fluctuations in levels of borrowings.

**2014** **2013**
**£m** **£m**

**1% movement in the UK Sterling interest rate**
Income statement movement **3** 2
Other equity movement **—** —

**_(e) Liquidity risk_**

The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the long and short term cash flow
projections for the business against facilities and other resources available to it. Headroom is assessed based on
historical experience as well as by assessing current business risks, including foreign exchange movements.
Existing facilities do not expire until March 2015 and November 2015; it is Group policy to refinance debt
maturities significantly ahead of maturity dates.

**_(f) Credit risk_**

The Group’s exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored. Debt, investments, foreign exchange and derivative
transactions are all spread amongst a number of banks all of which have short or long term credit ratings
appropriate to the Group’s exposures. Trade receivables primarily comprise balances due from Consumer and
TalkTalk Business fixed line customers, and provision is made for any receivables that are considered to be
irrecoverable.

**_(g) Capital risk management_**

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern
while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. Further
detail is provided in the Chief Financial Officer’s statement on page 14.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18, cash and
cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and
retained earnings as disclosed in notes 21 to 22.

The Group’s Board reviews the capital structure on an annual basis. As part of this review, the Board considers
the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital. The Group has a medium term target
gearing ratio of 75% to 100% determined as a proportion of net debt to equity. The gearing ratio at 31 March
2014 is 143% (2013: 89%) driven primarily by the Company’s continued investment in TV combined with an
increased dividend pay-out. The Board is confident that the gearing ratio will return to its target gearing ratio of
75% to 100% in the medium term.

### 20. Provisions

**_Accounting policy_**

Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of past events and it is
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made
of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted where the time value of money is considered to be
material.

Provisions are categorised as follows:

_Operating efficiencies_

Operating efficiencies provisions relate principally to redundancy costs and are only recognised where plans are
demonstrably committed and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the
balance sheet date. These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next twelve months.

_One Company integration_

These provisions relate principally to reorganisation costs and are only recognised where plans are demonstrably
committed and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date.
These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next twelve months.

_Property_

Property provisions relate to dilapidations and similar property costs, and costs associated with onerous property
contracts. All such provisions are assessed by reference to the terms and conditions of the contract and market
conditions at the balance sheet date. Onerous property contracts are expected to be utilised over the next seven
years. Dilapidation provisions are expected to be utilised as and when properties are exited.

_Contract and other_

Contract and other provisions relate to onerous contracts and contracts with unfavourable terms arising on the
acquisition of businesses and anticipated costs of unresolved legal disputes. All such provisions are assessed by
reference to the best available information at the balance sheet date.

The below tables analyse the Group’s provisions:

- On 16 September 2013, the Group’s Remuneration Committee determined that the relevant performance conditions of the VES
schemes (including the 5% TSR requirement) had been satisfied, meaning the VES participants were entitled to exercise the remaining
40% of their options as set out in note 5. The settlement of the schemes resulted in the recognition of share premium of £66m and a
£78m movement in retained earnings and other reserves.
** On 17 September 2012, the Group’s Remuneration Committee determined that the relevant performance conditions of the VES
schemes (including the 5% TSR requirement) had been satisfied, meaning the VES participants were entitled to exercise 60% of their
options as set out in note 5. The settlement of the schemes resulted in the recognition of share premium of £32m and a £63m movement
in retained earnings and other reserves.
*** On 14 May 2013, the Group acquired the remaining 75% of the issued share capital of FOC. The Group already held 25% of FOC and
had control of the business. The cash consideration paid for the acquisition of £3m has been recognised as a transaction with
non-controlling interest.

**_Group ESOT_**

The Group ESOT held 34 million shares at 31 March 2014 (2013: 39 million) in the Company for the benefit of
employees and former CPW employees. The Group ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends and none of
its shares have been allocated to specific schemes. At the year end the shares had a market value of £109m (2013:
£107m).

**_Demerger reserve_**

The demerger reserve primarily reflects the profits or losses arising on the transfer of investments and net assets
of CPW on demerger.

**_Translation reserve_**

The results of overseas operations are translated at the average foreign exchange rates for the year, and their
balance sheets are translated at the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the
translation of opening net assets and results of overseas operations are recognised in the translation and hedging
reserve. All other exchange differences are included in the income statement.

### 24. Commitments under operating leases

The Group leases network infrastructure and offices under non-cancellable operating leases. The leases have
varying terms, purchase options, escalation clauses and renewal rights. There were no leases which were
individually significant to the Group.

The Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum payments due as follows:

**2014** **2013**

### 26. Related party transactions

The Group’s related party transactions are made on terms equivalent to those that prevail in arm’s length
transactions.

During the current and prior year, the Group did not have any disclosable related party transactions.

The remuneration of the Directors, who are some of the key management personnel of the Group, is set out in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 26 to 39. The remuneration of all key management personnel is
disclosed in note 4.

### 27. Contingent liabilities

In the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group received £4m (2013: £29m) relating to an Ofcom determination that
BT had overcharged for certain wholesale Ethernet services. The full amount of £33m has been paid to the Group
at 31 March 2014. BT has appealed Ofcom’s determination in the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT).
However, the Group and other parties have also appealed the decision arguing that the original Ofcom
determination was too low.

In September 2013, a change to a previously agreed VAT treatment in relation to prompt payment discounts was
enforced by HMRC with immediate effect. In December 2013, following discussions with HMRC, the Group

F-162


-----

amended the arrangements and has accounted for the associated VAT benefit in the Group’s VAT return for the
three month period ended 31 March 2014. As at 14 May 2014, no decision has been reached by HMRC on the
appropriateness of the new arrangements. In the March 2014 UK Government Budget, a change in the VAT
legislation with respect to prompt payment discounts was announced. The change took effect on 1 May 2014.

### 28. Events after the balance sheet date

On 15 April 2014, the Group together with Sky announced they have joined forces with CityFibre to create a new
company that will deliver ultra-fast broadband services in the city of York. The Group’s investment in the
company will be accounted for as a joint arrangement in accordance with IFRS 11 ‘Joint Arrangements’.

As part of the agreement, the Group has committed to spend £5m over three years and will recognise through the
income statement, on an annual basis, its share of profit or loss generated by the joint arrangement.
